Headline: Students face possible $20 graduation fee
Author: by Rene Diaz Iturrey/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Commencement Committee unanimously approved a $20 graduation fee Jan. 15 during its last meeting. The proposal needs approval from the Executive Council and the University Fee Committee before it can be officially implemented according to Commencement Committee Chair Barbara Bader.

The funds generated by the graduation fee would be used to "enhance the ceremonies" by installing one or two large video screens, adding live music and possibly drapes for the side areas, according to the minutes of the committee meeting. 

"Usually graduations are so boring that anything they can do to alleviate that is welcome," graduate student Bill Levin  said.

"It would be worth it for the family of those graduating," senior Scarlette Carballo said.  "[The screens] would give them a chance to see their son or daughter get their diploma.  Also, it would give FIU a more professional, upscale appearance."

Howard Rock, Faculty Senate Chair and Commencement Committee member, recommended the fee at the meeting.

"Nearly every university charges a graduation fee to cover the immense costs of graduation," he said. "We are facing a terrible money crisis now in Florida. . . everyone has to play his or her part.

"Money not put into the costs of graduation ceremonies, which are very important to graduates and their families, including the ability to see what is going on (TV screens), can be spent in making sure that there are enough classes for students to graduate on time," Rock said. But some students and alumni disagree with the proposed fee.

"The school charges us enough as it is," junior Michael Valladares said.

Although Adrian Carter, Biscayne Bay Student Government Council president, is a member of the Commencement Committee, he was unable to attend the meeting because of scheduled activities related to the Martin Luther King holiday.

Carter opposes the proposed graduation fee and called it "ludicrous."

"It's an outrage that this committee has unanimously supported the idea of a graduation fee," Carter said, especially considering "the dramatic restructure of Bright Futures and tuition increases to come."

The implementation of Amendment Nine, the K-12 class size initiative approved by Florida voters this past November, is expected to negatively affect the Bright Futures Program and also force Florida's public universities to increase tuition over the next several years.

Jessica Morffi, University Park Student Government Council president, is a member of the Commencement Committee, but she was also unable to attend the meeting because she had another meeting scheduled at the same time.

"There is nothing wrong with having a nice commencement because it is the end of your college career, and it should be as nice as possible. But I think the wrong way is to charge the students for it," Morffi said.

Dean Weldon, a senior scheduled to graduate this spring, said "No, no, no. People have enough already. I don't need no TV [at graduation]." 

Millie Miguel, who graduated from the School of Business this past December, laughed when she heard about the proposed graduation fee. 

"I see the money that gets wasted here. There  is so much politics here. There is no need for that," she said.

Morffi said that no final decision has been reached yet, and the committee will be discussing the fee again at its next meeting sometime in Febuary.

Bader does not think the fee will be implemented.  

"It is far too premature to say that a graduation fee is being added. There are several channels that this proposal must pass through prior to being implemented," Bader said. "My guess is that it will be shot down very soon."

But Carter was not pleased with the actions of the Committee. He said the graduation fee would be "an indirect tuition hike" because the funds that are used to pay for the graduation commencement come from tuition funds received by the university.

"If the University starts a $20 fee and the state legislature allows the increase of tuition, the tuition has been raised twice," Carter said.

WEDNESDAY -		

Vacant SGA Positions Filled

Derek Capo filled the position of Business Representative. During his last semesters at FIU, Capo plans to involve the Alumni from the College of Business so that they can witness the growth not only of FIU but also of the College of Business. 

"I would like to provide more networking opportunities for those who have already graduated by creating an event much like a high school class reunion," Capo said. Also on his agenda is improving the College of Business itself and making it more useful to the students. Capo said he felt that he "can accomplish these tasks and more." 

Capo, a finance major with a minor in economics, is graduating in fall 2003. He also is a member of Alpha Kappa Psi and works as both a real estate salesman and an operations assistant manager at El Dorado Furniture Corp. 

Competing for the position of Lower Division Representative were Dejenny Derane and Huguette Esquivel. 

Derane was Student Government president at North Miami Senior High School for two years and also the president of the Future Business Leaders of America. She proposed improving the SGA website so that lower-division students could directly access her in an on-line discussion. Derane also planned to give lower-division students more opportunity for involvement and wanted to "launch the Reach Out Program to a more efficient level." 

Esquivel proposed to work more with the student body to help improve their experience. 

"My aspirations are to successfully represent the Florida International University student body," Esquivel said. 

She felt that her previous experience as Student Government president at Barbara Goleman High School during her senior year and Class of 2002 president would add insight to what students need when they start college. Esquivel suggested helping students realize the opportunities waiting for them at FIU by using different tactics, such as pushing for more public speakers in the classroom.

Both were tied and after a second vote, Esquivel won the position as Lower Division Representative. 

Fighting for Bright Futures

On Friday Jan. 24, the Florida Student Association met at Florida Atlantic University to continue discussions about the importance and necessity of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship program. 

"It has been a continuing issue for SGA," said University Park  SGC President Jessica Morffi, "and it is an important, sensitive, serious issue." 

Housing Improvements

SGC Housing Representive Kimberly Skiffington said this semester's goals for SGA include continued attention toward students in residence halls and trying to get them more storage over the summer. Skiffington also wants to start recycling in the dormitories and "give more support to the Residential Hall Association in the meetings and events".

Headline: $11 million art museum set to open doors in 2004
Author: Hatzel Vela
&nbsp;
The Art Museum at FIU will move from its 2,800 square-foot home in the Primera Casa building to occupy an $11 million 40,000 square-foot, three-floor building on a lakeside site next to the Management and Advanced Research Center on the University Park campus.

Construction is scheduled to begin this summer or fall and the building is set to open its doors 18 months later. The project, which has been in the works for 10 years, recently ended its two-year search of an architect. 

Museum Director Dahlia Morgan said Yann Weymouth, design director of Hellmuth Obata and Kassabaum, was the best candidate because of his extensive experience with museums around the world. 

Weymouth was recently honored by French President Francois Mitterand for his role as chief of design for I.M. Pei for the Grand Luvre project in Paris. His recent projects include three new buildings for the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota and the Uris Educational Center at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

"We love doing museums," Weymouth said. "[This museum] is interesting as a project because this museum is so alive and well."

Weymouth says the art program is strong considering its limited space.

"This program was functioning out of a basement," Weymouth said. 

Morgan agrees and said because of its strength, the program outgrew its space. 

Morgan said: "We were going to explode. Our program drove the need."

And need is why Patricia Frost got involved. When Morgan initiated a fundraising campaign five years ago, Frost was the first to get involved. 

"We needed to expand the gallery space program to accommodate the needs of the community, faculty and students," Frost said. 

Frost and her husband Phillip, after whom the museum is named, contributed an initial amount of $4 million. 

Other major contributors include B. Landon Carlin, Dorothea and Steven Green, Betty Laird Perry, Francien Ruwitch, Amancio Suarez and Carol and Norman Weldon. 

Frost has been a part of  the whole process, Morgan said.

"She has been totally involved with the development and drawing of the museum," Morgan said. 

Morgan added that Frost was not the only one involved in the building's design process. 

"We've taken ideas from students, museum staff, and even the dean of the [School of] Architecture," Morgan said. 

In its current plans, the building is set to have galleries with natural sun light, separate student galleries, a café and a children's discovery center. The museum will house FIU's permanent art collection, its program of temporary exhibitions and lectures, art scholarship and conservation.

Frost hopes this building will be the jewel of the campus and said the building itself will be a work of art.

Morgan, who has been director since the museum's opening in 1980, wants the museum to be a hub not only for students, but for the community.

"We want to attract our alumni and want to continue fundraising in order to expand programs and endowments," Morgan said.

Headline: Soccer reinstated for two years
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU eliminated men's soccer on Jan. 16. One day later, the university's administration reconsidered. Now, men's soccer is back - for at least two years.

Citing concerns for the program's student-athletes, FIU's administration decided to re-instate the men's soccer program for the 2003 and 2004 seasons. In one year, FIU will re-evaluate the situation and then make a final decision regarding its future.

The decision is a result of a week of meetings between Vice President Paul Gallagher, Athletic Director Rick Mello and head coach Karl Kremser.

The final decision came Monday morning when Gallagher and Kremser spoke while the coach was on his way to jury duty.

"Soccer has been a long-standing part of our university," Mello said following Monday afternoon's announcement. "There were some unforeseen effects on the student-athletes [due to the original decision]. The final analysis was that this was the best way to serve the student-athletes."

No formal criteria has been set for the one-year evaluation.

"I will be working closely with our head coach, Karl Kremser, and the FIU Athletic Council to develop a set of criteria for next year's evaluation that will speak to identifying and building support," Mello said. "We aren't in a place to put tangibles on that right now."

Kremser is satisfied with the outcome and plans to fight for the future of the program.

"I accept this final decision and I will support it," Kremser said. "I will do whatever it takes to keep the dream of men's soccer alive at FIU, including the immediate creation of a support group."

That support group will include community members who enjoy soccer and want to support FIU. The primary focus will be increasing revenue and attendance.

"It's one of those things that I've been meaning to do for a long time, but this type of thing will spur you to action," Kremser said.

The possibility of continuing past the two years was important to Kremser.

"We couldn't have just said that its two years and its over," he said. "If that happened, then the coaches wouldn't have stayed and the players wouldn't have stayed."

Kremser now expects each of his players to remain at FIU.

"I thought they were a special group before, but now they are even more special," Kremser said. "For them to handle the situation the way they did is amazing."

During the past week, the soccer program received support from students and administrators in the university.

"If there was one bright spot in this entire thing, it was the support," Kremser said. "I want to thank everybody who spoke out on our behalf."

The day after FIU made its original decision to drop the program due to financial considerations, the players met with the school's administration and discussed the difficulties that would result from attempting to secure a scholarship from another university this late in the school year.

Those concerns prompted the reconsideration of the program, Mello said.

The men's soccer program began play when the university opened in 1972. 

In the 31 seasons since, the program established itself as the most successful in school history, posting a 366-169-37 record and winning the 1982 NCAA Division II national championship. The program also reached the 1996 Division I championship game.

The situation surrounding the soccer program does bring about a revelation for Kremser.

"If nothing else, it's an indication of the changing realities of college athletics," he said. "I've always been happy to just coach my team and be happy with the type of people we recruit."

Headline: Proposed budget cuts threaten Bright Futures Program
Subheadline: Florida Student Association petitions to keep scholarship 
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Freshman Robert Sampson kept up his grades in high school and did well on his SATs.  Consequently, he was awarded a Florida Bright Futures scholarship, which he said, is the reason he is attending FIU.

"If I didn't have [Bright Futures], I wouldn't be able to go to college," he said.

But recently, some state legislators have been considering making cuts to the Bright Futures Program. These cuts are being considered in addition to other state university funding reductions that Governor Jeb Bush recommended for next year, which include a $111.5 million overall reduction in state funds.   

These budget cuts can be attributed to the implementation of the class-size amendment, which was approved by voters in November. 

The Florida Student Association, which is composed of the student government leaders of each of the state's public universities, held a meeting on Friday at Florida Atlantic University, where they vowed to save the Bright Futures Program.

"This was our effort to launch a formidable campaign to keep Bright Futures the way it is," Nicholas Kalman, FAU student government senate speaker pro tempore, said.

FSA members handed out petitions at the press conference, where they collected about 100 signatures, according to Kalman.  

Jessica Morffi, University Park Student Government Council president and FSA member, said SGC will be distributing petitions at its next meeting.  She said FSA's goal is to collect 500,000 signatures.

"We want to save Bright Futures as it is because it was formed to keep the best and brightest within the state, and we want to make sure that it does what it promised to do," Morffi said.

FSA will be holding a rally on the steps of the capitol building in Tallahassee on Feb. 13. They will be taking one or two buses full of students to the rally free of cost and then they will return the following day, according to Morffi.

"Hopefully we are going to get some student body presidents and a couple of leaders to speak to the appropriations committee," Morffi said. "The rest of the students who go on the bus that we will be providing will just show the support [for Bright Futures] that there is within the state."

Morffi invites all those who want to attend to contact the Student Government Association for more information. 

"This is the [students'] chance.  Once the scholarships have been taken away, there is nothing that they can do about it except complain," she said.  "What they need to do is try to prevent that from happening."

"There have been no specifics saying that they are going to take away the Bright Futures Program, but there are rumors going around that it is a possibility. So we are making sure that we are taking proactive measures and working so that it doesn't happen," Morffi said.

The state legislature will be discussing any possible changes to Bright Futures when they meet starting in March. 

At FIU, about 15,000 students receive financial aid, according to Sandra Capriola, assistant director of financial aid. Over a third of those are Bright Futures scholarship recipients.

"A lot of students have it, so it's going to make a big impact for those students who economically can't afford to pay for school on their own," Financial Aid Coordinator Zenaida Barrera said, "especially if they don't have any other means of financial aid."

Over 98,000 students received a Bright Futures scholarship for the 2001-2002 academic school year, according to the Florida Department of Education.

The Board of Education is specifically asking the state legislature to reduce scholarships to "Medallion Scholars," the second tier of Bright Futures recipients.  More than 4,500 FIU students fit into this category. Maria Tolon, associate director of financial aid, said that if cuts to the Bright Futures program are made, "it will impact us greatly because we have over 4,000 students on [Bright Futures]."

"There will be a lot of unhappy students," she said.

Junior Bianca Martinez said she would be one of those unhappy students.  "It would be a big deal if they cut it.  I couldn't really afford to get a job and pay for [my tuition] because I'm so busy with school and everything," she said.

Bright Futures is senior Jose Carrazana's main source of tuition funding.  "Without that scholarship, I probably wouldn't be going to school," he said.

"The thing I liked about Florida was that even if you didn't have the funds to go to college, you could because of Bright Futures; they always made a way for you," Sampson said.  "Taking that away would limit a lot of people's opportunities to go to college and get a good career, and I think that will just end up affecting Florida economically in the long run."

Headline: In Our View: Bright Futures program must stay
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In November, voters passed the controversial class size amendment.  The Beacon had, in this very editorial space, taken its stance against that amendment.  We argued that it would have repercussions on funding for the state's high education institutions.

And this is exactly the problem we are facing now.

Recently, state legislators, facing the financial burden of that amendment and other funding reductions  have begun to mull over the possiblity of making cuts to the state's Bright Futures scholarship program.  

The program benefits high school students  with high GPAs and SAT scores, providing motivation and rewarding achievement.

It helps students who might otherwise be financially unable to continue their education.

But most importantly, the program aids students who choose to stay in the state for their college education.

And this is perhaps the biggest benefit Bright Futures offers.

It keeps higher-achieving students in the state, where they are needed. 

Through the 2001-2002 academic year, over 98,000 Bright Futures scholarships were awarded to students.

That's 98,000 students that had the qualifications to enroll at universities in other states, at higher-profile universities.

If the state of Florida wants to be attractive to employers and businesses; if it wants to be respected, it must compete for these students.  The state of Florida has to get with the program.  Its future depends on it.

Headline: Affirmative action still needed
Author: by Vanessa Lopez/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
"It's reverse discrimination." 

"It's unethical." 

"It's a quota system that denies deserving students opportunities in favor of under-qualified applicants." 

I'm sure by now we've all heard arguments like these criticizing the necessary system of Affirmative Action. The issue has always teemed with controversy. 

Recently, however, it has been called into question with renewed vigor thanks to President Bush, who called the Affirmative Action policies at the University of Michigan - a school whose denied applicants have taken legal action against its Affirmative Action policies - "fundamentally flawed" and stated that it "amounts to a quota system that unfairly rewards or penalizes prospective students solely on their race." While the issue is usually on the receiving end of unwarranted attacks like these, Bush along with many others would be better served to look at the facts before pointing fingers.

While it may seem tempting to boil down complex social issues into overly-simplified arguments like these, Affirmative Action is far too important to be saddled down with unsupported accusations of reverse discrimination. 

To begin with, forget Bush's proposal to replace Affirmative Action with a system similar to the One Florida initiative, a system designed to promote diversity by guaranteeing admission to students in the top percentiles of their graduating classes. 

This system is fundamentally flawed as it depends mostly on high schools that have a large percentage of minorities to begin with, which is not the case for many schools around the United States. 

What about students who graduate just shy of the top-10 percent? And what about private universities? Can we really force Harvard to accept all graduates in the top of their classes? 

The fact is, if you can't implement this system across the board, and have no provisions for those students just shy of the top percentiles, then we cannot eliminate Affirmative Action. 

It becomes very difficult to substantiate the claim that Affirmative Action amounts to "reverse discrimination" when you consider that many schools, like the University of Michigan, do not have a quota system reserving an allotted number of seats for minority students.

 Athletics, extra-curricular activities, leadership skills, awards and recognitions are all heavily considered, along with GPA and test scores. 

 In fact, in a recent CBS News report on the matter, correspondent Bill Plante reported that of the 150-point system the University of Michigan uses to judge applicants, being a minority only accounts for 20 points. 

 This fact is perpetually ignored by students smarting over not being accepted to their school of choice and looking for a scape-goat. However, in an opinion brought forth by Judge Boyce F. Martin Jr. in the matter of Grutter v. Bollinger regarding the University of Michigan, the judge said "in considering race and ethnicity, the Law School does not set aside or reserve seats for under-represented minority students." Judge Martin further called the arguments "unfounded and inflammatory" and said it "advances the outrageous contention that the law school's policy allows for a minority applicant to put forth less effort than the otherwise similarly situated white applicant, and that somehow the minority will therefore use his race to compensate for his lack of effort." 

Bakke v. Regents of California, probably the biggest case against Affirmative Action policies, was a judgment against quota systems and not Affirmative Action specifically. It is possible, and is the case already in many schools throughout the nation, to consider ethnicity in a long list of criteria without implementing a quota system. In many cases, it's simply a matter of the diversity ratio of your applicant pools. Many schools with a high number of minority applicants may not need to weigh Affirmative Action as heavily as others. 

Many opponents of Affirmative Action erroneously assume that minority students are inherently under-qualified. But on what grounds can these claims be made? It is not, in fact, unbelievable to suggest that minority students also meet the many other admissions factors, in terms of GPA, test scores, etc. Many opponents of Affirmative Action would like to believe this is not true and bash the system with these ridiculous assumptions when we know that the vast majority of schools, especially selective schools, do not need to lower their standards to make allowances for Affirmative Action.

And oes Affirmative Action really keep non-minority students out? In terms of SAT scores, for example, in a recent Washington Post article, Goodwin Liu reported that "eliminating Affirmative Action would have increased the admission rate for whites from 19 percent to only 21 percent in the 1200-1249 range, and from 23 percent to only 24 percent in the 1250-1299 range." This is due largely, once again, to the long list of admissions criteria, of which Affirmative Action is just one part. 

Of course, it would be great to be able to say we live in a society that has overcome all of our racial and ethnic woes and that we have no need to implement measures to promote diversity. But while we have come a long way, we have not achieved this utopia just yet. The mere fact that minority students are falsely assumed to be under-qualified by many opponents of the system is proof enough.

Headline: Bush has profited from admissions policies
Author: by Andy Diaz/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
Affirmative Action is one of those issues that, superficially, is very easy to criticize and even dismiss. 

It does, in certain cases, give advantage to college applicants who are women, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and so on - the people we denote as minorities in the United States. 

In the Jan. 21 issue of The Beacon, a reader's letter to the editor by Drew Mallo calls it "disgusting," and "ridiculous;" this reader (with an apparent penchant for conspiracy theorizing) seems to believe that Affirmative Action is "a ploy by liberals in this nation." 

The reader is partly correct. Affirmative Action is a ploy by liberals to get more blacks and hispanics to receive a college education: yes, a nefarious and insidious "ploy" indeed.

The people in the Affirmative Action debate that bother me are not those like our beloved reader. They simply buy the rhetoric without thinking twice about it and their argument is equally easy to negate, if not satirize. 

The people that bother me, let me be more specific, the person who bothers me is President Bush who, in hypocritical self-denial, refuses to accept publicly that he is the poster boy for Affirmative Action.

The president, after all, got accepted into Yale University with mediocre marks and no outstanding extracurricular activities, except of course being the son of a very successful alumnus. 

President Bush, as expected, has no objection to this kind of "Affirmative Action;" he probably doesn't even consider it Affirmative Action.

Bush's argument against Affirmative Action - the kind that helps minority students get into good universities not the kind that gets rich boys with a "C" average in - is that it is an unfair way to promote diversity in the country's universities. 

This is a feeble rationale when one considers an article printed in the Wall Street Journal last week reporting that Harvard University accepts 40 percent of applications by the children of alumni while only accepting 11 percent of applicants overall.

What's disgusting and ridiculous about this, to use our dear reader's words, is that in a country where we openly disapprove of regimes like North Korea, where power was monarchialy passed on from Kim Il Sum to his son Kim Jun Il, university admissions are handed out in the same fashion. President Bush has yet to oppose this.

When critics of President Bush point out that he got into Yale although, well, he didn't deserve to, his brilliant political spinsters accuse these people of piquing racial tensions. 

Consider this: Who is a white university applicant who has just received a letter of rejection more likely to blame? A minority student or the half-wit son of an industrial-political magnate?

I will admit that the argument for Affirmative Action is easier to make when one stands to gain from it - as it is with every argument. 

As a Hispanic student, Affirmative Action clearly benefits me but the reality is this, even though my SAT scores where a good 200 points higher than the president's (according to this week's Time magazine Bush could only manage an 1100) and my grade point average a whole grade point higher I still would not have gotten into Yale University.

Headline: Handling Iraq, N.Korea demands finesse
Author: by David Pulgar/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
I've been monitoring the situation in Iraq very closely. Each morning that familiar ring from my computer tells me I received the latest news from CNN in my inbox. And since President Bush's tough talk on the axis of evil, war seems imminent.
Either Republican or Democrat, I believe the man to lead us should be the best person for the job. Bush made me proud when he responded to the attacks of Sept. 11. His compassion and motivation to seek justice made me think he was in control. 
That was until his declaration of the "axis of evil" when my opinion of him plummeted lower than the Mariana Trench.
When North Korea admitted to having a nuclear a weapons program my thoughts changed again. "Maybe he knows something I don't," I thought. But Bush's cry for war despite international disapproval kept me from giving him 100 percent approval.
At this,  moment North Korea is blackmailing us into giving them foreign aid. "Help us or we'll start up our nuclear weapons program," they say. If we're going to start a war with Saddam why not start one with N. Korea too? Let's sharpen that axe we call our military. It's been getting rusty in storage.
Where are we now? Stuck in a rut if you ask me. Bush may not be the idiot we're used to seeing on Saturday Night Live, but he sure isn't a tactical genius. 
We've got troops posted in the Middle East waiting for a smoking gun. Though they have found some questionable evidence in Iraq, it's far from what Bush needs to go to war. 
With troops poised and ready for battle, we stand to look like tyrants in the international community if we go to war and weaklings if we withdraw after committal.
Leaving the Middle East after such a massive buildup of troops could cause us to loose face with Arab countries. Nope, strategy is not Bush's forte. I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to play chess with a chainsaw.
I've never racked my brain so much to try and understand what an administration was thinking. With respects to both N. Korea and Iraq, it's hard to predict what's going to happen  next. 
Bush's presidency hasn't been the most forthcoming to the media or the public. The lack of evidence to corroborate what the government is saying prevents us from being believable both domestically and in the international community.
These increasing tensions between Iraq and between N. Korea must be met with finesse. While we can go to war without international support, no war will last if there is no motivation from the homeland. 
Without a consensus in Congress and the support of the American people we would have another Vietnam on our hands. America must be united in the actions it takes. If the majority of us are against war, then Bush should not push it.
Is Saddam a threat to be taken down? The only people that know, I hope, are our President and his advisors. We have to trust they are making judgments in our best interest and not theirs. But with all the shadow games they are playing its not easy to believe and a lot harder to trust.

Headline: Conroy gets personal with sports memoir
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
While on tour promoting a previous novel, "Beach Music," Pat Conroy met members of his Citadel basketball team as they began showing up at different book signings. At that time, he and his wife were in the process of a divorce. 

He realized that his teammates were coming into his life at a time of need, so he began recreating his 1966-67 senior year: the last year he served on the Citadel basketball team and the 21 basketball games that changed his life. These recollections, combined with dreadful childhood flashbacks, shaped "My Losing Season."

Conroy, author of "The Great Santini" and "Prince of Tides," never thought that he would write a novel about his senior year or the Citadel Bulldogs. It all began when John DeBrosse, a former teammate, came to see Conroy at an Ohio bookstore. After a long conversation, both men realized they were marked by that losing season: losing 13 games out of 21.  

 For Conroy, it was a year of transformation from athletic boy to novelist man. For DeBrosse, it was an experience that "partially ruined [his] life." 

To revive their experiences, Conroy sought out other teammates who had attended South Carolina's most legendary military college, the Citadel. Through this exploration, he rediscovered their few triumphs and more discomfiting defeats. But what he discovered in this search was that athletics played a vital role in each of the lives of these young men, helping all of them find their places in the world today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Specifically, Conroy recounts his game as a point guard. He admits not being very good, but he never gives up. He complains of having hands so small that he had to shoot a two-handed lay-up. And he writes about his ruthless coach, Mel Thompson, who not only verbally abused the players but also worked them so hard that it was borderline physical abuse. Conroy remembers one player throwing up because of the way Thompson conducted his favorite drills.

Even though Thompson was abusive, he never hit the players and that is why Conroy admits to loving him. Growing up in a military household, Conroy was constantly moving. His despotic father, Col. Donald Conroy, would use his fist as a form of discipline and the fact that Coach Thompson did not made him an idol to Conroy.

Conroy tells a story of one high school game that his father attended where Conroy scored 40 points. When they got home after the game, he found himself on the floor, covered in blood, as a result of not playing defense throughout the game. 

In another incident, his father took a glass and broke it across Conroy's face for laughing at the table. So, although set during the season of loss, the novel centers on Conroy's heartache living with a father who hit him more than he spoke to him. 

However, Conroy believes that if it weren't for basketball, he would have had no outlet for his anger and pain and definitely no relationship with his father. Once he became a novelist, writing became his outlet. 

Through his words, it becomes apparent why a season of loss turned into a great victory in his own life. 

Conroy admits that his senior year was one of the greatest because it was a year that taught him loss is a natural part of life; a year that taught him to accept those times when one doesn't win. He learned through his team that there is still dignity in fighting battles that are not won. This helped him cope with the violence and sadness he experienced with his father.

As a Pat Conroy devotee, I must say he has a style of writing that makes you feel as if you are experiencing his life yourself. Those non-sports fans out there, however, may lose interest and stop reading after the first few chapters because Conroy spends much time describing each practice and locker room conversation. It isn't until several chapters into the novel that he begins to intertwine his life experiences. Once he includes off-the-court stories, the book really takes off and you'll agree that it's worth getting through the first few chapters.

Headline: Elton John set captures three decades of hits
Author: Krystal Alvarez
&nbsp;
His fans have been through three decades filled with peculiar glasses, outrageous outfits and abundant hits. Since the 1970s, Elton John has brought to the mainstream world of pop a little flare and a lot of successful music. This British pop singer has had a wide range of hits throughout his 34 years in the music business. Whether it is through an oldie radio station or a trendy music video, he has managed to reach the ears of every generation and recently, he released the ultimate collection of his songs, Greatest Hits 1970-2002.

In 1970, when John's successful self-titled sophomore album emerged, the blues world, including the likes of Quincy Jones and Leon Russell, was enthused with the effort and its chart-topping hit, "Your Song." 

John did, however, have his fair share of critics who deemed him a novelty act on account of his loud outfits and diamond-rimmed Coke-bottle glasses.  

The skepticism eventually died down when he had 16 straight hits from 1972-1976 including such classics as: "Crocodile Rock," "Bennie and the Jets" and "The Bitch is Back" (all of which can still be heard on the radio).

In 1984, John publicly announced his homosexuality and told the media of his marriage to long time boyfriend, Renate Beul. He also spoke candidly about his struggle with bulimia and cocaine addiction. 

After overcoming this turmoil, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and continues to support a cure for AIDS. Despite the controversy, John signed a contract with Disney in 1994 and agreed to sing several of the songs on the "The Lion King" soundtrack.  

With hits like "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," John was exposed to listeners from a younger generation. 

Recently, he released Songs from the West Coast whose music videos featured Justin Timberlake as a young Elton in the self titled single and Robert Downey Jr. lip=syncing the blues in "I Want Love." Both singles found their way to the top of the contemporary music charts. 

The album Greatest Hits 1970-2002 spans three decades. It contains everything from mellow love songs like "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" and "I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues," to more upbeat, feel-good music like "I'm Still Standing" and "Don't Go Breaking My Heart." 

The album also includes the largest selling number one single in history at the time, "Candle in the Wind," the song that he sang at Princess Diana's funeral. 

Greatest Hits 1970-2002 is without a doubt a great compellation of one of the greatest artists of our time. Even if one is not an Elton John fan, one can appreciate what he has done for music. 

Every song captures a different place in time and demonstrates how much music has changed through the years. 

It is no wonder that this musical chameleon with such a captivating fashion sense could win over the world. 

This album will unquestionably create new fans for the ever-changing Elton John and be an add-on to his list of accomplishments.

Headline: Carey tries to crawl back to diva status
Author: Kim Wright
&nbsp;
Mariah Carey's back, but does she still have what it takes to be number one?  After a brief hiatus involving record label disputes, disappointing sales figures for her movie "Glitter," the death of her estranged father, a mental breakdown and physical exhaustion, Mariah Carey returns to the music scene with her latest album, Charmbracelet.

After listening to the entire album for the first time, I was not inspired to play it a second time, but then it began to grow on me. Charmbracelet is filled with ballads and for those who like Hip-Hop Mariah, there are collaborations with a few of today's top-selling rap artists.  

Guest performers include Cam'Ron on the track "Boy (I Need You)." Cam'Ron helps out by providing his lyrical skills and a sample of the infectious hook from one of his top selling singles of 2002, "Oh, Boy."  Other guest performers include Freeway and Jay-Z on "You Got Me" and West Side Connection on "Irresistible."  

Producer/rapper Jermaine Dupri's presence is definitely noticeable in this album, as well as that of top producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

The first single released, "Through the Rain," is an inspirational song about survival and perseverance. This is a song  anyone can relate to, despite its clear echoes of Maria's hit "Hero."  

One of my favorite songs on this album, "Clown," is slightly different and explicit enough that you begin to wonder who Carey is singing about.  Another favorite is Carey's remake of Def Leppard's 1981 hit "Bringin' on the Heartbreak."  

Carey has accomplished many things including winning over 60 various awards and becoming the single best selling female performer of all time, with 15 number one singles during her career, beginning in 1990. 

In addition, Charmbracelet is the first release for her own record label, MonarC Music. Charmbracelet is not a very innovative album. Many of the songs on it sound like music you could have heard in the mid-to-late 90s. Carey may have the voice of an angel - with a five octave vocal range - but the vocal arrangements on her new album are weaker and less moving than those on her previous albums. Musically, Carey appears to be regressing instead of progressing.  

Charmbracelet is not a bad album but it is also nothing too spectacular. Charmbracelet may overcome failures and setbacks, maintaining Carey's title as an international diva but, because of its mediocrity, it will most likely fade away.

Headline: SPC provides wide variety of movies
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
You are broke and single. Suddenly you meet that special someone. However, the drama continues, because even though you no longer have to spend lonely nights watching reruns of "Golden Girls," you are still broke. Let's face it: Dating is expensive.

Or perhaps it is that time of the week when the weekend peeks out promising lots of alcohol and dancing, but won't let you embrace it for another 24 hours, those desperate Thursday nights when you crave distraction but at the same time feel awfully tired.  So who do you call for help?  What can you do?  Well, whether you are broke or stressed or just a movie fanatic, the Student Programming Council just might be your salvation. 

SPC is coming back this spring semester with a new "Cinema Thursdays" and "Friday Movie Mania" attitude. This time, however, SPC is providing more film genre diversity and stepping away from fall's traditional action-packed movies because of students' complaints: namely, the lack of "chick" flicks. SPC president, Ron Hollis, explained "this semester we are trying to satisfy students by providing variety."

The "Cinema Thursdays" theme for this semester is "Twisted Minds" and SPC is featuring an excellent mixture of mind-blowing dramas and thrillers such as "A Beautiful Mind," this year's much acclaimed and possible Oscar-candidate "Road to Perdition" and the fascinating and possible award-winner "Frida."  Other films that will be featured in this complex, scary-plot category will be the 1999 version of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Requiem for a Dream." The showings began Thursday and will continue weekly at 8 p.m. throughout the semester.

"Friday Movie Mania" will feature shows both at 7 and 10 p.m. and although SPC's new attitude attempts to reach more students, it has kept some of its traditional rituals. Yes, the free popcorn and giveaway prizes before every show still remain.

"Red Dragon," the spooky prequel to "Silence of the Lambs" about the flesh-eating Hannibal Lecter that stars Anthony Hopkins, Ed Norton and Ralph Fiennes, opens up the film program. However, things turn rosy with Reese Whitherspoon's romantic comedy "Sweet Home Alabama." Gore Verbinsky's horror film "The Ring" follows, preceding the free-styling Eminem drama "8 Mile." Of course, SPC could not forget about those movie-goers who love senseless humor and included the why-on-Earth-did-anyone-watch-this? movie, "Jackass." But not all "Movie Mania" comedy is a blunder since Day-Day and Craig come back with a ghetto holiday in "Friday After Next." 

 Too many laughs and not enough action? Well, SPC gives us a good dose of explosions, high-speed chases and spy stuff with Halle Berry and Pierce Brosnan in "Die Another Day" and later, they cool it down with the recent romantic comedy "Maid in Manhattan," starring none other than Miss J.Lo and Ralph Fiennes.  Aside from the fact that J.Lo plays the not exactly challenging role of a Hispanic woman from The Bronx, there is enough comedy for this movie to be bearable and even "cute" in a strange way. 

Finally, if you are a fan of the fantasy world, "Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets" will be the last featured film. Action, comedy, drama, suspense and free movie dates for you and that special someone. It seems like this semester, we are finally getting it all.

Headline: Improv Festival to bring laughter to Miami
Author: Krystal Alvarez
&nbsp;
Remember the times when as child everywhere you went was the setting for an extraordinary event, when imagination allowed you to do anything or be anyone and fantastic conversations were made up on the spot? For most of us, these are just childhood memories, but for the performers in the Miami Improv Festival (MIF), pretending is all in a day's work.  

MIF has gathered an array of 16 talented improvisational groups from all over the U.S. to perform at Coral Gables' Dreamer's Theatre from Tuesday, Jan. 28 to Sunday, Feb. 2. These groups include Just the Funny, which actually got its start at FIU and whose members founded the festival, and Impromedy, which also counts a few FIU alumni as performing members. 

Other acts include All Jane no Dick, an all-girl improv group from Portland, Ore., and Chicago's Bassprov, whose members perform a play based on audience suggestions. There are also late-night comedy jams which have less rules and are less inhibited than the other performances. 

The Miami Improv Festival is the first of its kind and has enough to offer to become an annual event in South Florida.  

"The festival gives South Florida a chance to get exposed to real improvisation. It gives people the chance to really know what improv is and that it does exist locally," Assistant Director David Christopher said .

As an audience member, expect bizarre, humorous skits and plays from some of the biggest talents nationwide. Prepare for impersonations and wacky characters such as Alex Perdomo's ultimate Cuban stereotype, Carlos Valdez, and sardonic humor like the Cupid Players' improvs embedded in song. There is something for every type of audience. 

"The audience being involved with what we do onstage really makes my whole performance worthwhile. Without their suggestions, the performance wouldn't be as fun for any of us," Impromedy member Ozzie Quintana said.

"The best type of audience is one who laughs. I really like them best," jokes Perdomo.

Tickets for each performance cost $10; the late-night jam sessions are free with a ticket stub from any show. At this bargain, you might want to take advantage and discover your inner comedian. Laughter may not be the best medicine for you, but what about a free after-party? There will be one after each late-night jam session. 

The first after-party is at midnight, Tuesday at The Bar in Coral Gables; the last and biggest after-party will be on Saturday, the last night of the festival, at Valentino's in the Grove. There are also improvisation workshops (tickets are $50) offered throughout the festival that are instructed by seven people who have links with such groups as the Upright Citizen's Brigade (Comedy Central), the Annoyance Theatre and ComedySportz. To purchase tickets for a performance or workshop or to get more information, go to www.miamiimprovfestival.com or contact their office  by calling 305-951-1875.

Headline: Baseball wins opening series
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Pitching, defense and a little timely hitting served as FIU baseball's recipe for success this weekend.

The Golden Panthers opened the 2003 season with two home wins over the Florida A&M Rattlers. FIU needed only 10 hits over 15 innings, thanks to pitching and defense that surrendered three runs in the two games.

"We have to bank on our pitching and defense," FIU coach Danny Price said following the second game.

FIU 13, FAMU 2 (7 innings)

On a night where temperatures dipped to the low 40s, FIU kept the Rattlers out in the cold during two six-run innings on Friday.

"In a game like this, the conditions are so bad you have to have pitching and defense," Price said. "You just can't hurt yourself."

The Golden Panthers benefited from several gifts in the bottom of the first inning, scoring six unearned runs thanks to three FAMU errors. FIU also benefited from Rattler starting pitcher Mike Sills' three hit batsman and one walk.

FIU didn't produce a hit until the ninth batter of the inning. By that time, the Golden Panthers owned a 4-0 lead with one out. 

Second baseman Dennis Diaz then added two more runs with a single off Rattler third baseman Dale Hall's leg. Hall immediately left the game with an injury.

FIU sent 12 batters to the plate in the first, producing 6 runs on 2 hits.

FIU's second team All-American, Derek DeCarlo enjoyed a very different day than Sills. DeCarlo gave up 2 runs in 4 innings, allowing 4 hits. He also had 3 strikeouts and 4 walks.

"I think I did [well]," DeCarlo said. "Of course I could do better. But you have to start somewhere, and work from there."

Derek Taylor replaced DeCarlo in the fifth and picked up the win with 3 innings of shutout pitching.

Price and pitching coach Mark Calvi set a strict pitch count for DeCarlo because of the weather.

Price said if the conditions were different, he would allow DeCarlo to pitch an extra inning.

"Everybody would like to see the kid get the win," Price said. "But its not about today. It's about the end of the year and keeping the kid healthy."
DeCarlo understood.

"Who wouldn't want to get the win?" he said. 

"But I know it will work out better for me at the end."  

Sills' struggles continued in the third inning.

Shortstop Luis Rivera hit a pop-up that landed between the right fielder and first baseman for a double, scoring two runs and increasing the FIU lead to 8-1.Rivera went 2-4 in the leadoff spot, with 4 RBI and 2 runs.

Following Rivera's double, first baseman Brian Pullin forced Sills from the game with a single between the shortstop and third base for a 9-1 lead. Sills finished without recording an out in the third inning. He gave up 11 runs, 4 earned, on 5 hits, 2 walks and four hit batters.

Both teams agreed to end the game after 7 innings.

FIU 1, FAMU 0                                                                             

FAMU held the Golden Panthers without a hit on Saturday - until it mattered most.

A.J. Patrick and Jimmy Horne combined to throw 7 no-hit innings against FIU, but the Golden Panthers got the only two hits needed in the eighth.

Catcher Michael New ended the no-hit bid with a lead-off double to right field in the eighth. 

Skip Adams then moved New over to third with a ground out to second base, setting the stage for Fernando Alvarez.

"The key to that whole thing was Skip getting [New] over," Price said. "That had to be done. That was essential."

Alvarez swung at the first pitch Horne offered and sent it into right field, scoring New. 

FIU needed nothing more.

The game reached the eighth scoreless thanks to Joshua Banks seven shutout innings. Banks allowed 3 hits while striking out 11, before giving way to Carlos Sanchez. 

Banks, coming off an injury plagued 2002, feels that he is ready to regain his status as a full-time starter after 10 games in the Cape Cod league this summer.

"Slowly, I worked myself back up to being able to start," Banks said. 

"I was nice and relaxed. I was just trying to compete as hard as I could."

Sanchez didn't allow a hit in the eight and got the win.

After FIU took a 1-0 lead, Edgar Ramirez earned the save with a 3-batter ninth.

Headline: Expectations high for 2003 baseball season
Author: Steve Perhla/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU baseball team hit the diamond on Friday with high expectations. 
Led by outfielders Adam Summerell and Solomon Frieder, third baseman Skipton Adams and catcher Michael New, the seniors are looking to lead the team to make a run at the College World Series.

"No question, our goal is to get over the Regional/Super Regional hump and get to Omaha," said preseason All-American pitcher Derek DeCarlo.

Joining sophomore DeCarlo on the starting pitching staff are seniors Andrew Edwards and Carlos Sanchez, and junior Josh Banks. Freshman Edgar Ramirez could be called upon to close games out of the bullpen.

DeCarlo, who won the right to start on opening night vs. Florida A&M, was named Sun Belt Conference Rookie of the Year last season, posting an 11-0 record with a 3.53 ERA, while striking out 92 batters in 94 1/3 innings pitched.

The Golden Panthers will also need help from junior transfer Ricardo Nanita, who batted .394 over a two year span at Chipola Junior College. Nanita, who plays right field, has been referred to as FIU's top power hitter.

"He's a real good player and we're definitely going to need his bat in the middle of the lineup," said longtime head coach Danny Price, now in his 24th season.

The rest of the starting lineup will consist of sophomore Dennis Diaz (29 stolen bases in 02') at second base, freshman Luis Rivera at shortstop, junior Fernando Alvarez as DH and either freshman Brian Pullin or Michael Lopez at first base.

However, Price is looking for his seniors to pick up their games and lead the younger players.

"Our team leaders are based around our seniors. I always look for the guys with experience to lead the ball club. If you're a senior, I expect leadership,"  Price said.

The senior class is led by center fielder Adam Summerell, who batted .335 with 10 homeruns and 38 RBI's, to go along with his 13 stolen bases last season.

Other seniors expected to lead FIU include  Adams (.323, 9 HR, 47 RBI), Frieder (.346, 7 HR, 26 RBI), and New (.478, 2 HR, 9 RBI). 

New, who played in only seven games, along with Andrew Edwards, were among two key Golden Panthers dealing with injuries last season, which contributed to FIU's postseason struggles.

Added Price, "Injuries are going to happen. But I think we did what we could do. I credit our kids, but the injuries [last year] created controversy. It's my responsibility to lead through the hard times. We just had so many injuries, it got out of control."

With a healthy Golden Panther team seemingly intact, Price is stressing leadership and fan support as the keys to reaching Omaha.

"We need the whole team to step up. We have to expect to win everyday, and get over all the setbacks and controversy," Price said.

When asked what key games are circled on the calendar, Price was quick to respond, "Win them all."

"It's all about the first game and the next game. The day you look past the game at hand, you're done," Price said.

With a tough schedule that includes cross-town rival Miami (ranked 14th nationally by Collegiate Baseball), FAU (ranked 21st), UCF (ranked 26th), as well as conference foes South Alabama (ranked 20th), New Mexico St., and Louisiana-Lafayette, the Golden Panthers need all the support they can get.

"The key is fan support. We need the fans out there. Just like the first football game, we need people out there," DeCarlo said.
After finishing fourth in the Sun Belt Conference last season, Price agreed. 

"I think with football, we started to hit on the students. But we know everybody goes to the Miami game, but the conference games mean so much. When you talk about the conference games, you're talking about some big, important games," Price said. "The fans are the 10th player. They make such a huge difference." 

"I hope when we play FAU, that we have more fans than they do. We need to get our ballpark filled and turn some people out." 
The Golden Panthers were ranked 38th nationally by Collegiate Baseball, and posted their sixth straight regional appearance last season. 

"Again, the key is fan support," DeCarlo said. 

"The more students we have at the ballpark, the better chance we have to win games, bottom line."
