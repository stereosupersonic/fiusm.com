Headline: International beer buzzes pub-goers
Author: Diane Mooney/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Two drunken construction workers pretended to punch each other as I pulled up to Billabong's, a bar wedged between a mattress store and a massage parlor. The bar's sign promised great food and beer but the faux pugilists heralded crappy dive. I'm well past the age of Charles Bukowski as role model. Now my tastes run more towards microbrews and aged cabernets.  

But a friend had sworn Billabong's had great hamburgers. I'm catholic when it comes to food. If it's good, I'll eat it. And I don't care about ambience. I'll eat anywhere: a lunch wagon, a cafeteria, a fly-speckled ethnic joint    

So I wasn't about to let a little thing like rock-em, sock-em alkies get between me and food. I skirted the drunks and walked in. Through the gloom I could make out the mock wood grain tables and metal chairs that seem to be standard issue in every dump from Hollywood, Fla. to Hollywood, Calif. A curved wooden bar stretched across the front of the room. A half wall corralled a row of pool tables.  But something was missing. No neon signs for Michelob or Miller buzzed on the walls. No posterized women in bikinis licked their lips while holding a can of Coors. 

Instead a wooden sign for Tetly's Ale hung next to a soccer-clad beauty promoting MacGregor's Stout. A mustachioed man behind the bar polished a pint glass with a spotless white rag. 

Beer taps bloomed in graceful clusters to his left and right. I read the name on the tap closest to me. Then I read it again. It still said Framboise Lambic. 

Framboise Lambic is possibly the most delicious alcohol man has ever created. This Belgian raspberry-based beer combines a heady mix of sweet, dry and tart flavor. I'd had trouble finding it bottled in Los Angeles. Here it was on tap at a Hallandale mini-mall. 

 I felt woozy and it wasn't from hunger. I grabbed a stool. A cocktail waitress pumped an old-fashioned beer pull. She held a pint glass at an angle, slowly filling it with a rich dark brew. An elderly man watched avidly. 

"That's good English porter," he said to me, nodding at the glass. "Sweet and nourishing as mother's milk. I won't drink anything else." 

The waitress set the porter, now topped with a rich creamy head, on the bar in front of him. He lifted it to his lips and took a delicate swallow. He closed his eyes for a moment before setting the glass down. "Ah," he sighed. "This is a beer to linger over." 

The bartender appeared before me, tugging at his mustache. The perfect picture of a pub proprietor with laughter-creased eyes and a gently rounded stomach, no doubt from sampling his wares. He braced himself on the bar in front of me.  

"What kind of place is this?" I asked.   

"We sell beer. That's what we do." He waved his hand at a cooler stacked with more varieties of beer than an ABC Liquor wet dream. "175 different kinds in the bottle. 17 on tap," he said?

My thoughts wavered from the taps to the cooler, cooler to the taps. Should I have a bottle of Chimay, a high-alcohol beer brewed by Belgian monks or a pint of Kostritzer, a German black lager? A rumble from my stomach reminded me of my original mission. "You serve food too?"

He passed me a menu. "I'm the chef. Best burgers you've ever had. But the kitchen doesn't open until 6 p.m."

I checked my watch. It was only 5 o'clock. But I didn't think I'd mind waiting. This was one watering hole worth diving into.

Billabong's Pub is located at 3000 Country Club Lane in Hallandale. Their hours are Mon-Thurs. 3p.m.-1 a.m., Fri, 3 p.m. -2 a.m. and Sun. 12-2a.m. For more information call 954-985-1050 or visit www.billabongpub.com.

Headline: Grundberg lecture inspires even non-photographers
Author: Nicholas Ribera/Graphic Designer
&nbsp;
First and above all else, I'm a realist. I find art's charisma in the ordeal of production and the god-given talents that allow for a separation between artists and enthusiasts. So it is without surprise that I "placed" little value on photography, seeing it more as chemistry than art.

So what brought me to GC 100 on  March 4, 2004? For one thing, it would be the 10 points worth of extra credit allotted to a student of Figure Drawing One. But those points aside, I allowed myself to be educated. Andy Grundberg has a whopping resume under his belt: essayist and photography critique for the New York times, chairman of photography at Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington, D.C., consultant of photography at the Frick Museum of Art, the director of Friends of Photography in San Francisco, and author of many books including "Inside Havana," "Abstraction in Contemporary Photography," "Andy Warhol: Polaroids," and the acclaimed "Crisis of the Real."

His face was proud, and his voice, educated. And as his "thank you's" subsided and the applause wavered, he made his expertise known.

In the vain of an ever-important professor, he taught his audience the leaps of writing with light in postmodernist photography. 

Beginning with Abel Morell, the artist who's work has been in exhibition at the Frost museum, Mr. Grundberg described the different movements in contemporary works.

His attention described Leventhal's "Himmler Moves East," a collection of photographs of military action figures disguised to hyperrealism in order to depict undocumented portions of the Nazi invasion of Russia, following this with a description of the '70s-'80s movement of staging history.

"Cultural representation is handed to us as a given from the time we enter the world," states Grundberg on the subject of post modernist photography. 

Ideally, recreating undocumented portions of history  epitomizes his statement. And from this grew the movements whose descriptions soon followed:

"Reactionary pieces" occurred, depictions of genitalia and gut wrenching cadavers that capture the time in which they were shot. The "documentary style" which follows in the vein of staged history with slices of life, and even the complete escape of "cultural representation altogether," as Grundberg puts it. 

With the return to photography as a chemical phenomenon, using silver prints and photo paper and chiaroscuro.

While the true value of the lecture goes beyond a five hundred-word story, its effects will continue to percolate through those who were there. To get the full effect of what was experienced that windy night last Thursday, one should pick up any of his publications "Crisis of the Real."

Headline: Filmmaker tackles fast-food debate
Author: Delroy Alexander/Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
The red-haired clown with a larger-than-life smile has welcomed generations of children to McDonald's. But the bloated mug of a filmmaker soon could scare away health-conscious adults.


The Project


In the new documentary "Super Size Me," filmmaker Morgan Spurlock eats only McDonald's food for 30 days and documents his rapidly deteriorating health. 

Interspersed with segments about obesity and processed food in the United States, viewers watch Spurlock pack on 25 pounds, ride out wild mood swings and get warnings from doctors about his rising cholesterol levels and liver toxicity. The movie will be released to theaters by the end of May.

The movie could cause more people to bring lawsuits against McDonald's Corp., predicts John Banzhaf, a professor at George Washington University Law School. A consultant in lawsuits against McDonald's, Banzhaf appears in the documentary and was instrumental in building a case against the tobacco industry.


The Outcome


"What this movie did is show that if you eat there frequently, yes, there can be problems," Banzhaf said. 

"I would bet a lot of people are working overtime to figure out how to deal with this film," said Larry Kramer, a crisis management expert with Manning Selvage & Lee, who advised Nike boss Phil Knight in 1998 after a documentary showed children making its shoes in Indonesia.

Filmmaker Michael Moore's "The Big One" quickly led to major changes in Nike's operation.

Kramer said he likens McDonald's current predicament to a situation he faced in 1993, when he helped burger chain Jack in the Box rebound from a food poisoning outbreak blamed for the deaths of four children.

"We had to provide some perspective on food safety and tell our customers some hard truths," he said. " I think the challenge that McDonald's faces is to communicate that eating three squares a day at its restaurants is not a healthy pursuit. People have to make smart choices."


Crisis Mode


In McDonald's case, executives are already in crisis management mode.

"The movie is a distortion of reality. I'm sure we'll have more to say after we've seen the film," Ken Barun, Ronald McDonald House Charities president said.

McDonald's is adamant that the nation's obesity problems are complex.

"This is really not about McDonald's. It's more about personal responsibility," said Cathy Kapica, McDonald's director of worldwide nutrition. "I'm not sure that comes across in the movie."


Power of Suggestion


The company's broader strategy is already clear. 

Its executives are stressing personal choice, telling customers to make sensible choices and to limit fatty or sugary foods. 

McDonald's also is trying to educate consumers about the broader range of offerings it has on its menu. And the company is asking the media to closely examine Spurlock's motives.

"We are talking about someone who has obviously gone to excess and exploited a brand that people will relate to in order to make his movie and capitalize on something that is unrealistic. It should be put in the category of the rest of the shock TV that you see."


Past Projects


Barun's reference to shock TV is a subtle dig at the filmmaker's past. Spurlock was the brains behind a Web-cast and short-lived MTV show in 2000 called "I Bet You Will," which centered on people doing almost anything for money.


Healthy Alternatives 


Kramer, the crisis management expert, said McDonald's must take authority on the issue of food and nutrition to counter any impact from "Super Size Me." 

"They have to be the ones that say, 'No, you shouldn't be eating six cheeseburgers a day.' It's a very credible answer and doesn't alienate their core customer that does eat a lot of cheeseburgers."

The company is doing exactly that. Customers soon will be able to buy an adult Happy Meal, which includes a salad, bottle of water, a pedometer and a diet and activity log designed by nutrition expert Bob Greene.

"We've been putting nutritional information in stores for 20-plus years," Barun said. 

Barun and Kapica also point to healthier offerings, such as grilled chicken, recently introduced salads and the move late last year to an all-white-meat chicken McNugget.


Legal Battles


The old McNugget drew criticism in an ill-fated obesity lawsuit against McDonald's last year from a judge who described the product as a "McFrankenstein creation of various elements not utilized by the home cook."

After the company won the legal battle, in which two overweight teenagers claimed their health problems were related to eating at the chain, criticism of McDonald's and other fast-food chains died down.

Even with the talk of obesity and potential lawsuits, McDonald's bottom line has yet to feel the pinch.

"We are concerned with the increasing debate and what kind of impact it might have, but the sales trends don't show any impact," said Mark Sheridan, a restaurant analyst with Johnson Rice & Co. "People talk healthy but eat what tastes good."

And so far, McDonald's remains reluctant to recommend just how many times a week a burger lover should visit its restaurants.

"It's an individual thing; there's no specific numbers," said Kapica. "It's not where you eat, it's what you eat and, especially, how much you eat."

Headline: Texas laws invade privacy
Author: Diane Munoz/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Joanne Webb, former fifth grade teacher, dedicated mother of three and housewife, executive member of the Burleson City Chamber of Commerce. She has long, blonde, curly hair, loves wearing miniskirts and line dancing, and is reportedly still quite the looker for her 42 years. By any standard, conservative Texan's measures, she is a sweet, friendly, and valuable member of the Burleson, Texas community.

At least, this is what they might've said about her before October of last year. As of now, she has surprisingly found herself adding, "Advocate for Women's and Sexual Rights" to her resume, and this is causing some people in this quiet suburban Texas neighborhood to drastically change their opinions of her. So how did this very feminine and attractive Southern Baptist gal find herself in this position? 

In October of 2003, Joanne Webb was the subject of a sting operation incited by the Burleson City Police Department. Two under cover detectives entered her house, cleverly disguised as a married couple, during one of the Tupper-Ware style parties that she hosted for the adult toy company, Passion Parties. After selling the "couple" two sex toys, she was formally charged with violating Texas Penal Code 43.23, which outlaws the sale or possession of any such "obscene devices."

Texas Penal Code 43.23 is located in a body of so called obscenity laws, in the same ranks as promoting or possessing child pornography, selling indecent materials to a minor, or employing a minor in harmful or obscene work. According to the law, an obscene device is a, "device designed and marketed as useful primarily for stimulation of the human genital organs." This could include items such as condoms that are marked "for his or her pleasure," which can be found at any supermarket. 

Apparently in Texas, it is just as bad to be a kiddie-porn peddler, as it is to sell sex toys to responsible consenting adults. I guess I shouldn't be so surprised at this law. But you know what? I am surprised; in fact, I'm shocked. 

How can laws like these still be in place in this country, which proudly boasts to be "The land of the free?" How can we honestly display shock and disgust at middle-eastern fundamentalist laws which oppress women and sexual conduct, and yet also allow for laws such as the one in South Carolina, which makes it illegal to have sex in anything but the missionary position? The Taliban would be proud.

Regardless of your personal opinion or religious beliefs, the law says it's not okay for you to break into someone's home and demand that they stop having sex doggie-style. I can just hear it now, "Halt! In the name of the law, I am placing you under a citizen's arrest! Take the blindfold off, put the dildo down, and step away from your wife sir!" 

I thought that an essential part of the conservative ideology was less government involvement. Apparently, this only applies in the case of big corporations and their freedom to run off to Bermuda in order to escape tax laws. While the Webb's local churches reserve the right to have kicked the Webb family out of two churches, the government does not have the right to kick her out of her home for trying to improve American couples' sex lives.

After all, I don't see any laws prohibiting the use of Viagra. On the contrary, our current administration actually provides quite hefty subsidies for Pfizer and other  such pharmaceutical companies.

Thank God that there are people like Webb and her attorney BeAnn Sizemore, who are brave enough to stand up to these unconstitutional laws. They are filing a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of such laws.

No matter what my personal sexual preferences are, I cannot  support laws that which give old white guys like John Ashcroft an all-access pass to peep into our bedrooms at night (or whenever it is you prefer to have sex). At this pace, they're gonna be making laws about who we can and cannot marry! Oh, wait...

Headline: GM, students team up to create marketing agency
Author: Ana Marquez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
General Motors is teaming up with FIU's marketing students through an industry-education program called General Motors Marketing Internship. Students are given the opportunity to create a working marketing agency, which they have named Creative Edge, with a budget of $2,500 given by their clients Brickell Pontiac of Miami a division of general motors. 

EdVenture Partners, manages the program in conjunction with GM, giving the students the tools and guidance necessary to run their campaign.

"We give the students the tools to create a working marketing agency and guide them to meet their objective," said Denise Fernandez, program coordinator of Edventure Partners.

GM has been responsible for the participation of 350 campuses nation wide. GM contacted FIU two years ago and since then students have been getting not just a glimpse but actual hands-on work with a marketing agency.

"Working in a team-based environment has helped us learn how to deal with people, communicating with different companies and exchanging information; real world experiences," said Joe Enriquez, student event coordinator.

The students are responsible for researching, implementing and evaluating a promotional campaign for their client, Brickell Pontiac. They spend four weeks doing research on their target market, college students, and designing an interactive campaign to promote increasing awareness of Pontiac vehicles. 

"Our main goal is to create awareness of Pontiac vehicles and to expand and reach Generation Y" said Kim Vernon, student and public relations department co-coordinator. 

Each semester the students come up with a new name, logo, and campaign.

They are also eligible to compete with the rest of the Southeastern United States for the General Motors Marketing Internship Scholastic Achievement Award. The top two universities receive a $1,500 award and are invited to GM's Southeast regional office in Atlanta to present its campaign to GM executives.  

This year, the students came up with the name "Creative Edge" and Danny Mayorga, the advertising coordinator came up the with logo. 

"I have never experienced real-life pressures: impressing our clients, putting together flyers, banners, and posters" Mayorga said.

This year's campaign is "Cruisin Calle Ocho." It will be held Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Chapman plaza between the Graham Center and Gold Parking Garage. 

"The event consists of a Carnival-type atmosphere with race inspired decorations. 

"The activities and games at the event have been designed to help generate interest in the event and promote participation," according to a Creative Edge Report. 

They will have free food, gifts, contests and the chance to experience the Pontiac Vibe and Pontiac Grand Prix.  

  A survey conducted by the class during their research period revealed that Honda was the most popular car with 20.3 percent student drivers followed by Toyota with 10.7 percent and Pontiac with only 1.7 percent. 

"Through this campaign we will try to change the image and perception students have of Pontiac vehicles," said Kim Vernon, student, public relations department co-coordinator. 

After the research is completed, the students present their ideas to executives at General Motors and Brickell Pontiac in a professional presentation and await approval to begin their project.

"Overall reaction to the program is incredibly positive. Students love having the opportunity to work on a real marketing project while interacting with business professionals (our client, Brickell Motors.)  All work completed by the students is approved by the client, which further enhances the professionalism of the class," said Professor Tim Dugan.

Headline: Relay for Life helps raise $30,000 for cancer society
Author: Solana Hernandez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Through a committee of 17 FIU students and with the help of 22 teams, the American Cancer Society raised more than $30,000 at the fourth annual Relay for Life, a fund-raising walk-a-thon held March 5 at the FIU Community Stadium.

By means of raffles, food sales, tarot readings and massage sessions, the teams were able to double the amount previously raised at FIU.

Chairperson Marly Quincoces, a sophomore, was able to bring this event to reality with much effort from her committee members and America Cancer Society worker Arleen Uria-Speed.

With six months of preparation, the Relay For Life at FIU brought more than 500 people together to participate in this family oriented activity. Being that this year's theme was "Superheroes," teams camped out along the stadium track and decorated their tents with names such as "Mortal Kombat" and "Robin Hoods."

People of all ages walked around a track surrounded by luminarias, decorated paper bags with candles inside, which people bought to raise more funds. 

During the Luminary Ceremony all the candles were lit while Tania Aleman sang Mariah Carey's "Hero" in tribute to both those that did not survive from cancer and those who have made it through. 

At least one person from each team had to be walking on the track throughout the 18-hour ordeal. Meanwhile, between live bands, freeze-tags, and pie eating contests, the team members tried to stay awake for the whole night. 

The event started out with the "Victory Lap" in which cancer survivors and their families sported "I survived" t-shirts. It ended with an awards ceremony that recognized the teams that had raised the most money, among other things. 

The Golden Key team raised more than $3,000, followed by the American Medical Student Association with around $2,400 and the Student Social Work Association with around $2,200. The "Best Spirit Award" went to the National Society of Collegiate Scholars.

The money will go toward advocacy, patient services, education, and research on the eradication of cancer. 

Senior Director of Multicultural Services Robert Coatie and College of Education staff member Linda Spears-Bunton are two faculty members who struggled through cancer and were present at the event. 

"Just watching the students walking reminds me of these caregivers," Coatie said, admitting he'd been more open about his disease once it was under control. 

Spears-Bunton, however, had been willing to talk about it from the day she was diagnosed more than a year ago. 

Her father died of prostate cancer at a time when resources were not as available as they are today. "[Relay For Life] is a powerful way to give back. As a survivor, I've been recipient of the benefits raised with this money," Spears-Bunton said. 

Relay for Life started with colorectal surgeon Gordy Klatt's ambition to raise money for cancer research in 1985. 

The Relay is now a worldwide event organized each year in 3,800 communities within the United States and has spread to seven other countries. It raised $264 million in 2003 in the United States alone. 

Moreover, it is a means to remember those who've died of cancer, and a way to raise awareness about something that has affected and will continue to affect so many families.

Headline: Wine & Food Fest. hits Miami
Subheadline: Hospitality students gain experience at festival
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor In Chief
&nbsp;
Amidst the glamour and glitz of the third annual South Beach Wine and Food Festival, which ran from March 5-7, were more than 400 FIU students making it all happen.

While 1,700 festival goers sauntered through the sand, drinking champagne and savoring shrimp and quail under the glowing moonlight, students from FIU's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management grilled under tents and the supervision of renowned chefs. 

According to FIU Chef-Instructor Michael Moran, the students prepared 14,000 portions of food in 40 hours at the Biscayne Bay Campus, and then shipped the food to the Delano Hotel in Miami Beach on a refrigerated semi truck in time for Friday's main event,  the Mot and Chandon BubbleQ. 

"The teamwork was unbelievable," said Moran, who instructs the students in a class called Culinary Events Management, one of two classes that revolve around the festival.

The festival comprised the BubbleQ, two public Grand Tastings, a Tribute Brunch, and other dinners and seminars at various locations in Miami Beach, Downtown and Coral Gables. 

All but a small portion of the proceeds from the festival go to the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.   

The amount raised this year is yet to be determined, but last year's festival brought in about $400,000 for the school, said HTM Associate Dean Lee C. Dickson.

The festival also provides hands on experience for the students involved. Students worked closely with distinguished chefs to prepare food and run cooking demonstrations at the festival.

"While we're in school, we don't get too many opportunities to be put in positions that really take advantage of our talent," said Julie Adams, a junior majoring in hospitality management.

 "Although most of us do work in the industry, sometimes we don't get to really shine, and the festival definitely provides that opportunity for many of the students."

Adams, 20, who has worked at the festival for the past two years, said the experience has made her more confident about her career choice and she believes working with the chefs will help her land a job after she graduates. 

Adams said the chefs keep in contact with some of the students and remember them when they see them the following year.

Even though the stress of preparing for such a large event can be overwhelming at times, Adams said, ultimately the experience is rewarding, especially because of the sense of teamwork that it builds.

"What is great about [the festival] is that the students all come together because of this," said Johana Flores, a senior majoring in hospitality management. "That's what I like."

 Moran, who has worked for numerous years as a chef in addition to his 13 years teaching at FIU, knows the stress of hosting large events all too well.

He compares the scale of the event to a tsunami in which you have to close your eyes, hold your nose, and be ready for when it hits.

"I told the students that after this event was over, they were either going to love their career choice or they were going to hate it," Moran said.

In total, close to 20,000 tickets were sold for the various festival events, Dickson said. Exact attendance figures were not available as of press time.

Dickson described the festival as the "ultimate hospitality experience." He said the festival is important because it gives exposure to FIU, helps the local economy and the school, and provides experience and networking contacts for students.

"It's really a great partnership between industry and education," Moran said.

Colorado's strict recruitment rules affect other schools, NCAA

Although the University of Colorado's sweeping changes related to football recruiting appear to be the most restrictive in the nation, some of the new rules are already expected to be followed by recruits at many others schools, including the University of Wisconsin.

One portion of Colorado's new rules states that recruits won't be allowed to "use alcohol or drugs, attend private parties, enter bars or strip clubs or engage in activities that violate team rules, campus policies or laws."

These changes seem to be taking place after Minnesota officials came under fire when it was learned that several recruits were taken by current players to a Minneapolis strip club. School officials did not previously have a stated rule prohibiting recruits from participating in such activites.

Head Coach Barry Alvarez acknowledged at the time he was considering sending a letter to each recruit, the player's parents and coach to spell out what type of behavior would be expected during the visit.

However, NCAA president Myles Brand recently appointed a task force to review recruiting rules and recommend new standards, mandating more substantive changes.

Some suggest cutting back campus visits to 36 from 48 hours; allowing recruits just three paid campus visits instead of five; and limiting visits to weekdays.

Kerry seeks running-mate, campaigns in Florida

Sen. John Kerry named prominent Washington Democrat James Johnson and Walter Mondale, to start vetting potential running mates, moving quickly to the next stage of his presidential campaign as the de facto Democratic Party nominee.

While the campaign released no names of potential candidates, speculation in Democratic circles has focused on Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York,  and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, among others.

If Kerry has a favorite, it is likely he will keep it secret for months to sustain a sense of drama before the Democratic National Convention, which starts July 26 in Boston.

The swift move of naming Johnson was part of Kerry's strategy to sustain momentum after his nine-state primary win last Tuesday. 

He made Florida the first stop on his victory lap, highlighting the state's power as a symbol of Democratic anger toward President Bush, who won Florida by 537 votes in a recount in 2000. His visit acknowledged that the Sunshine State remains a battleground for November.

Iraqi officials sign interim constitution

A twice-postponed signing ceremony for Iraq's interim constitution finally took place Monday in Baghdad, marking an important milestone in the U.S.-led coalition's plan to hand sovereignty to a transitional government by June 30.

The signing of the document was delayed because of last week's deadly terrorist attacks and again on Friday after an 11-hour political dispute.

The "basic law" calls for elections by January 2005 for a transitional government that would write a permanent constitution. The interim constitution also sets civil rights guarantees.

Later in the day, a leading Shiite cleric issued a statement complaining that the law "places obstacles to arriving at a permanent constitution" that preserves "unity and the rights of its people, in all their ethnicities and sects." His concerns, which center on a provision that would give the Kurds virtual veto power over the permanent constitution, were what caused five Shiite members to balk Friday, just before the signing was to take place.  Immediately after Monday's ceremony, leading Shiite member Ibrahim al Jaafari read a statement signed by 12 of the 13 Shiite council members saying they still had concerns and signed "in order to safeguard national unity."

Headline: Christian concert promotes spirituality
Author: Sue Arrowsmith/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Less than two weeks after the controversial film, "The Passion of The Christ" stirred an awakening throughout our nation, The Awakening came to University Park March 4. 

The first ever Christian concert at FIU, which was sponsored by The Navigators at FIU, an international, interdenominational organization, sought to bring awareness to students about the on-campus organization and help them grow spiritually. The event was co-sponsored by The Peacemakers from Trinity Church and dozens of donations from outside campus resources. The entire event was free to all FIU students, including the hot dogs, chips, and sodas. 

"We didn't want the students to pay for anything," said Vidal Olivas, leading representative for The Navigators. 

Double Syx, Leah Rouse, and The Awakening Band were the featured live entertainment. Rouse was a finalist on the popular television program "American Idol," Double Syx is a Christian rapper from Texas, and the band is from Pennsylvania. They came to FIU for what they believe is an important cause. 

"It's all about making God real to people," said Awakening band member Nick Hodges, who helped put the concert together. He's also part of the FIU College Campus Ministry and will begin teaching a non-credit Bible Studies class, free of charge, this month in the Graham Center.     

Tables were set up around the Panther Hall pool area with flyers and clipboards from participating organizations for those interested in attending meetings and Bible studies. Peacemakers passed around contact cards to keep students updated about upcoming events as students passed by on bicycles and rollerblades enjoying the breezy night.

Olivas was introduced to The Navigators when he was a student in his native Costa Rica. He joined fellow Navigators here and began working with the club at FIU, which is now two years old. 

The club meets on campus regularly to develop a deeper understanding in the Gospel, but they also offer one-on-one support and counseling. It's their sense of unity and friendship that is, perhaps, the most positive aspect The Navigators share and that's what sets them apart. 

Eddy Herrera, Navigator student president at FIU, said members also get together on campus to play sports or just hang out.    

Though the club is fairly new at FIU, the movement began about 70 years ago. The founding navigator was Dawson Trotman, a Navy man of California. While the world was at war in the 1940s, the U.S. government was suspicious of any groups who did not formally identify themselves. 

For that reason and because the initial members were all in the Navy, they called themselves The Navigators. But the name also has a deeper symbolism. 

It was founded on a pay-it-forward belief that Christianity should not be limited to worship at a church or temple, but instead should be based on living by the principles expressed in the Bible and passing on that knowledge to benefit others. 

In fact, Vidal points out, their main purpose is to reach non-religious people. As students made their way across campus, they stopped to look. Initially they were drawn in by the music, then the free food sign, but most who got closer stayed to share the experience. They swayed to the music or clapped. Despite the students' participation, they were a little hesitant when it came down to signing up. 

FIU alumni Horby Lopez, a music major who took a brief break from rollerblading to eat a hot dog, said though he respects other people's beliefs, he is not in favor of joining a group. 

Still, students each walked away from the concert with something different, as diverse as their reasons for being there. 

"It's a good way to relax and get away from the stress of school. FIU should do this more often," Lopez said. When asked why she was there, Marjani Christian, an early childhood education major, said, "I am here because I am a Christian and want to support their efforts." Yet, she also expressed her concerns about the overwhelming stress of college life and how committing to another club would just be too much right now. 

She's not alone. Most FIU students work or have multiple responsibilities that take up a lot of their free time.  

Crystal Ortiz agreed that it's tough, but said it can be done. 

She's a management information systems student, an FIU employee, and part of The Navigators. "I go to one-on-one sessions or I'll only go if we're meeting at someone's house outside of school," Ortiz said.

Ironically, the same excessive pressure that keeps students from joining The Navigators is the very reason Olivas and others feel it's necessary to bring spirituality to FIU. They consider this particularly important for young people, especially college students who are sometimes away from their families and feel very alone. 

After listening to students' concerns, Olivas and Herrera considered working together on a more flexible schedule. 

Navigators are not easily discouraged, though. They know committing is not an easy thing to do and hope events like The Awakening will encourage students to at least stop by. Together with fellow sponsors, they are talking about another Awakening. "Hopefully," said Rachel Sturgeon of the Peacemakers, "we'll be able to do this for the students every semester."

Headline: GM, students team up to create marketing agency
Author: Ana Marquez/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
General Motors is teaming up with FIU's marketing students through an industry-education program called General Motors Marketing Internship. Students are given the opportunity to create a working marketing agency, which they have named Creative Edge, with a budget of $2,500 given by their clients Brickell Pontiac of Miami a division of general motors. 

EdVenture Partners, manages the program in conjunction with GM, giving the students the tools and guidance necessary to run their campaign.

"We give the students the tools to create a working marketing agency and guide them to meet their objective," said Denise Fernandez, program coordinator of Edventure Partners.

GM has been responsible for the participation of 350 campuses nation wide. GM contacted FIU two years ago and since then students have been getting not just a glimpse but actual hands-on work with a marketing agency.

"Working in a team-based environment has helped us learn how to deal with people, communicating with different companies and exchanging information; real world experiences," said Joe Enriquez, student event coordinator.

The students are responsible for researching, implementing and evaluating a promotional campaign for their client, Brickell Pontiac. They spend four weeks doing research on their target market, college students, and designing an interactive campaign to promote increasing awareness of Pontiac vehicles. 

"Our main goal is to create awareness of Pontiac vehicles and to expand and reach Generation Y" said Kim Vernon, student and public relations department co-coordinator. 

Each semester the students come up with a new name, logo, and campaign.

They are also eligible to compete with the rest of the Southeastern United States for the General Motors Marketing Internship Scholastic Achievement Award. The top two universities receive a $1,500 award and are invited to GM's Southeast regional office in Atlanta to present its campaign to GM executives.  

This year, the students came up with the name "Creative Edge" and Danny Mayorga, the advertising coordinator came up the with logo. 

"I have never experienced real-life pressures: impressing our clients, putting together flyers, banners, and posters" Mayorga said.

This year's campaign is "Cruisin Calle Ocho." It will be held Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Chapman plaza between the Graham Center and Gold Parking Garage. 

"The event consists of a Carnival-type atmosphere with race inspired decorations. 

"The activities and games at the event have been designed to help generate interest in the event and promote participation," according to a Creative Edge Report. 

They will have free food, gifts, contests and the chance to experience the Pontiac Vibe and Pontiac Grand Prix.  

  A survey conducted by the class during their research period revealed that Honda was the most popular car with 20.3 percent student drivers followed by Toyota with 10.7 percent and Pontiac with only 1.7 percent. 

"Through this campaign we will try to change the image and perception students have of Pontiac vehicles," said Kim Vernon, student, public relations department co-coordinator. 

After the research is completed, the students present their ideas to executives at General Motors and Brickell Pontiac in a professional presentation and await approval to begin their project.

"Overall reaction to the program is incredibly positive. Students love having the opportunity to work on a real marketing project while interacting with business professionals (our client, Brickell Motors.)  All work completed by the students is approved by the client, which further enhances the professionalism of the class," said Professor Tim Dugan.

Headline: Relay for Life helps raise $30,000 for cancer society
Author: Solana Hernandez
&nbsp;
Through a committee of 17 FIU students and with the help of 22 teams, the American Cancer Society raised more than $30,000 at the fourth annual Relay for Life, a fund-raising walk-a-thon held March 5 at the FIU Community Stadium.

By means of raffles, food sales, tarot readings and massage sessions, the teams were able to double the amount previously raised at FIU.

Chairperson Marly Quincoces, a sophomore, was able to bring this event to reality with much effort from her committee members and America Cancer Society worker Arleen Uria-Speed.

With six months of preparation, the Relay For Life at FIU brought more than 500 people together to participate in this family oriented activity. Being that this year's theme was "Superheroes," teams camped out along the stadium track and decorated their tents with names such as "Mortal Kombat" and "Robin Hoods."

People of all ages walked around a track surrounded by luminarias, decorated paper bags with candles inside, which people bought to raise more funds. 

During the Luminary Ceremony all the candles were lit while Tania Aleman sang Mariah Carey's "Hero" in tribute to both those that did not survive from cancer and those who have made it through. 

At least one person from each team had to be walking on the track throughout the 18-hour ordeal. Meanwhile, between live bands, freeze-tags, and pie eating contests, the team members tried to stay awake for the whole night. 

The event started out with the "Victory Lap" in which cancer survivors and their families sported "I survived" t-shirts. It ended with an awards ceremony that recognized the teams that had raised the most money, among other things. 

The Golden Key team raised more than $3,000, followed by the American Medical Student Association with around $2,400 and the Student Social Work Association with around $2,200. The "Best Spirit Award" went to the National Society of Collegiate Scholars.

The money will go toward advocacy, patient services, education, and research on the eradication of cancer. 

Senior Director of Multicultural Services Robert Coatie and College of Education staff member Linda Spears-Bunton are two faculty members who struggled through cancer and were present at the event. 

"Just watching the students walking reminds me of these caregivers," Coatie said, admitting he'd been more open about his disease once it was under control. 

Spears-Bunton, however, had been willing to talk about it from the day she was diagnosed more than a year ago. 

Her father died of prostate cancer at a time when resources were not as available as they are today. "[Relay For Life] is a powerful way to give back. As a survivor, I've been recipient of the benefits raised with this money," Spears-Bunton said. 

Relay for Life started with colorectal surgeon Gordy Klatt's ambition to raise money for cancer research in 1985. 

The Relay is now a worldwide event organized each year in 3,800 communities within the United States and has spread to seven other countries. It raised $264 million in 2003 in the United States alone. 

Moreover, it is a means to remember those who've died of cancer, and a way to raise awareness about something that has affected and will continue to affect so many families.

Headline: Wine and Food Fest hits Miami
Subheadline: Hospitality students gain experience at festival 
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor In Chief
&nbsp;
Amidst the glamour and glitz of the third annual South Beach Wine and Food Festival, which ran from March 5-7, were more than 400 FIU students making it all happen.

While 1,700 festival goers sauntered through the sand, drinking champagne and savoring shrimp and quail under the glowing moonlight, students from FIU's School of Hospitality and Tourism Management grilled under tents and the supervision of renowned chefs. 

According to FIU Chef-Instructor Michael Moran, the students prepared 14,000 portions of food in 40 hours at the Biscayne Bay Campus, and then shipped the food to the Delano Hotel in Miami Beach on a refrigerated semi truck in time for Friday's main event,  the Mot and Chandon BubbleQ. 

"The teamwork was unbelievable," said Moran, who instructs the students in a class called Culinary Events Management, one of two classes that revolve around the festival.

The festival comprised the BubbleQ, two public Grand Tastings, a Tribute Brunch, and other dinners and seminars at various locations in Miami Beach, Downtown and Coral Gables. 

All but a small portion of the proceeds from the festival go to the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.   

The amount raised this year is yet to be determined, but last year's festival brought in about $400,000 for the school, said HTM Associate Dean Lee C. Dickson.

The festival also provides hands on experience for the students involved. Students worked closely with distinguished chefs to prepare food and run cooking demonstrations at the festival.

"While we're in school, we don't get too many opportunities to be put in positions that really take advantage of our talent," said Julie Adams, a junior majoring in hospitality management.

 "Although most of us do work in the industry, sometimes we don't get to really shine, and the festival definitely provides that opportunity for many of the students."

Adams, 20, who has worked at the festival for the past two years, said the experience has made her more confident about her career choice and she believes working with the chefs will help her land a job after she graduates. 

Adams said the chefs keep in contact with some of the students and remember them when they see them the following year.

Even though the stress of preparing for such a large event can be overwhelming at times, Adams said, ultimately the experience is rewarding, especially because of the sense of teamwork that it builds.

"What is great about [the festival] is that the students all come together because of this," said Johana Flores, a senior majoring in hospitality management. "That's what I like."

 Moran, who has worked for numerous years as a chef in addition to his 13 years teaching at FIU, knows the stress of hosting large events all too well.

He compares the scale of the event to a tsunami in which you have to close your eyes, hold your nose, and be ready for when it hits.

"I told the students that after this event was over, they were either going to love their career choice or they were going to hate it," Moran said.

In total, close to 20,000 tickets were sold for the various festival events, Dickson said. Exact attendance figures were not available as of press time.

Dickson described the festival as the "ultimate hospitality experience." He said the festival is important because it gives exposure to FIU, helps the local economy and the school, and provides experience and networking contacts for students.

"It's really a great partnership between industry and education," Moran said.

Dear Editor:

Relatives of terrorism suspects held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are asking the president of the United States to return their family members back to their countries for trials. Actress Vanessa Redgrave and even the international community have supported this claim. I think the same emphasis should be placed in the case of Cuban political prisoners. 

March 18th will mark the first anniversary of the Cuban communist regime's crackdown of 75 dissidents. Their only crime: having a mind of their own.  Dissident physician Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet is among the detainees and was sentenced to 25 years in prison only because he defends The Universal Declaration of Human Rights for the people of Cuba. A prisoner of conscience, Biscet, has been confined to a dungeon where he suffered inhumane prison conditions. 

Dr. Biscet, as all activists in the human rights movement in Cuba, believes in a non violent approach to his struggle. He is a 42-year-old black physician and a follower of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi. Neither Biscet, nor the other prisoners deserve to be in jail. 

It's time for the international community to put pressure on the Cuban regime and have these men and women released. Just as terrorism suspects are entitled to have their human rights respected, Cuban dissidents should also be entitled to basic human rights. In Biscet's words: "Long Live Human Rights!"

Headline: Softball wins two of three over weekend at FAU Worth Invitational
Author: Andres Cordero/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers also managed their first win over a ranked opponent, defeating No. 23 Notre Dame to open tournament play. 

FIU's other Worth Invitational games included a loss to North Carolina and a 5-0 victory over UMass, improving its record to 6-14 on the year.

March 6 - Game 1 - FIU 2, No. 23 Notre Dame 1

Senior Kristen Perry's RBI single in the top of the sixth led FIU to a 2-1 victory over No. 23 Notre Dame March 6.

The Fighting Irish opened the scoring early with a runners-at-the-corners double-steal in the first inning that scored left fielder Nicole deFau.  

Notre Dame threatened FIU starter Amanda Nealer again in the third, loading the bases on just one out. Nealer managed to get the next two batters to pop out on infield flies and kept the game within one run. 

The Irish held the one-run lead into the sixth, where FIU tied the game on senior Jennifer Owens' RBI single. 

Perry then followed with the game-winning hit, scoring Owens.

 "It feels great to start winning again," Owens said of the team's first win over a ranked opponent. "I didn't even know they were ranked. I don't think anyone [on our team] did. We just went out there and played. We're capable of being ranked too. Our pitching has been solid. It's a matter of putting some hits together and picking up wins."

Notre Dame had a runner on third with two outs in the bottom of the sixth, but FIU closer Nicole Barrett got Carrie Wisen to pop out to center, ending the threat. 

Barrett (1-4) was awarded her first win of the season after pitching three innings of two-hit, shutout ball. 

Heather Booth pitched a complete game for Notre Dame, but took the loss.

March 6 - Game 2 - UNC 2, FIU 1

On the same day they defeated their first ranked opponent of the season, FIU dropped its second contest to the North Carolina Tar Heels (12-7). 

FIU's first and only run came in the second inning, when freshman right fielder Brittany Witherow (2 for 3) singled down the left field line, plating Cindy Turek for the 1-0 lead. 

"We're surprised at how great she's become so quickly," coach Gwydir said of the freshman outfielder. "She's playing well and driving in runs."

But Witherow's single was not enough. 

Kendra Laminack allowed an RBI double to North Carolina shortstop Emily Price in the sixth. Nicole Barrett was then brought in to pitch for Laminack. She fanned the first batter she faced, but Owens misplayed a hard-hit grounder from Michelle Hoffman and the ball rolled to left field allowing Price to score the go-ahead run.

An FIU three-up, three-down at-bat in the seventh sealed the game and awarded North Carolina pitcher Alison Yin (5-4) the win. Laminack fell to 3-6 with the loss.

March 7 - Game 3 - FIU 5, UMass 0

After splitting their first two games, the FIU women thrashed Massachusetts, 5-0, on March 7 to conclude the FAU Worth Invitational. 

Laminack (4-6) redeemed herself of a previous loss by following it up with an impressive four-inning shutout. 

Barrett got her first save of the season after three innings, striking out as many batters and allowing just one hit and one walk.

Each batter from two to six in the lineup picked up an RBI in the game. Owens brought Vetters home in the first on an RBI single past second base.

 In the third, Owens walked and reached second on a wild pitch. She advanced to third on a Perry groundout and was brought home on a double by Witherow to extend the lead to 2-0. 

The next batter, sophomore Jennifer Powell, plated Witherow on a single to left-center for a three-run FIU lead.

UMass had its chance in the fifth when Laminack gave up two consecutive hits to start the inning. Barrett replaced Laminack and the runners advanced on a pop-out to left. 

Candice Molinari reached base on a fielder's choice, when first baseman Cindy Turek threw a runner out at home. 

Riding that momentum, Barret struck out the very next batter to end the inning and preserve the shutout. 

FIU, however, was not finished scoring. Turek led off the next inning with a double and was brought home by a Perry single. 

Turek also scored Tabitha Embry on her final at-bat to bring FIU's total to five runs.

"We've had great pitching all year, but we couldn't get the run support," Gwydir said. 

"We're finally hitting the ball better and the plan now is to turn the corner and win more games."

March 3 - FAU 7, FIU 5

FIU starter Derek DeCarlo issued three costly walks in the first inning, contributing to three FAU runs, and the Golden Panthers never had the lead, falling 7-5 to the Owls at University Park.

FIU tied the game at three in the fifth inning on an RBI groundout by Luis Rivera. 

However, the Golden Panthers fell apart an inning later. 

DeCarlo settled down after the rocky first inning, but ran into more trouble in the sixth. 

He walked a batter, threw a wild pitch and then allowed a two-run homer to FAU right fielder Rob Horst (1 for 3, three RBIs,) giving the Owls a 5-3 lead.	

Jon Banke relieved DeCarlo in the seventh, but was greeted with a two-run single by Robbie Widlansky (2 for 3, two RBIs,) increasing the FAU lead to 7-3.

After Yahmed Yema's sacrifice fly cut the lead to 7-4, P.J. Lehmann's solo homer drew FIU within two runs, but it wasn't enough.

March 5 - FAU 13, FIU 1

A day after narrowly defeating FIU on the road, FAU delivered a more convincing victory in front of its home fans, routing the Golden Panthers, 13-1, March 5. 

FIU starter Andrew Edwards (2-1) struggled and took the loss, allowing 11 hits in only three innings, while allowing nine runs.

"The game started off bad for us from the beginning," said FIU centerfielder Dennis Diaz. "We were not in the game at all.  It was definitely a let down," he said.

FAU scored five runs in the third and added another eight in the fifth, led by second baseman Derek Hutton, who went 3 for 5 with three RBIs.

FIU's lone run came in the eighth inning on a Luis Rivera RBI single.	

March 6 - FAU 13, FIU 5

FIU returned home looking to end a two-game skid to FAU, but the result was the same - another loss to the Owls.

The Golden Panthers trailed 4-2 entering the eighth inning, but lost pace, as FIU reliever Danny Hernandez allowed seven runs on six hits in the inning. FAU first baseman Jeff Fiorentino finished FIU off with a grand slam, giving the Owls an 11-2 lead entering the bottom half of the eighth.

"We came out playing hard, but things haven't been going our way," Diaz said.

FIU added three runs in the bottom of the eighth, but FAU countered with two more in the ninth. Starter David Asher (0-1) took the loss for FIU, after allowing four runs in 5.1 innings of work. He also struck out six batters in his first start of the season.

FIU's first two runs came on back-to back homers by Jeff Skellenger and Yema in the second inning.

March 7 - FAU 6, FIU 5 (12 Innings)

The series headed back to Boca Raton and FIU was one out away from finally knocking off the Owls, but could not hold on, falling 6-5 in extra innings. Leading 4-1 in the bottom of the ninth, FIU reliever Leo Calderon allowed two singles with no outs before being replaced by Mark Worrell.

Worrell struck out the first two batters he faced and seemed to have momentum on his side. But then disaster struck. 

Pinch-hitter Robert Orton stepped up to the plate and connected for a three-run shot, tying the game at four.

The game was tied after eight innings of play, but FIU added three runs in the top of the ninth on RBI singles by Eduardo Davila, Lehmann and Diaz.

In the top of the 12th inning, FIU took a 5-4 lead on a solo homer by right fielder Brian Aragon. In the bottom of the 12th, Worrell issued two walks but recorded two outs on groundballs, setting the stage for the final out once again. But once again, Worrell missed an opportunity to seal a win.

Anthony Albano drilled a double into left, scoring two runners and giving FAU the win. Denny Hernandez started for FIU, recording nine strikeouts in five innings of work, while allowing only one run. Worrell (1-4) took the loss. Said Diaz after the game: "We were fighting the whole game... Eventually we will get things done. We'll be fine."
