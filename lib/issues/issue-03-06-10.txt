Headline: Business, hospitality management merge

FIU administrators have announced that the School of Hospitality Management is now a self-governing unit within the College of Business Administration at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Merging the two schools in order to better serve BBC business and hospitality management students was proposed by Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs.

"The College of Business Administration doesn't have enough money to adequately staff the school the way that it is staffed at the [University Park] campus," said Joseph West, associate dean of SHM. "So we're going to help them."

Both schools will remain individual entities offering their own separate degree programs, maintaining individual budgets and hiring their own professors. The major difference now, according to West, is that as of this fall, the schools will be sharing faculty members and facilities. 

This faculty sharing is possible due to overlaps in the course requirements of students seeking degrees from each respective school. To expand class offerings and because of CBA's inability to hire new teachers due to its limited financial resources, faculty members who teach introductory courses in SHM will now teach some of those same courses to business students at BBC. Some professors who usually teach three or four classes will end up with an extra class in the fall.

"Hospitality is a business and a number of the courses that hospitality students take are similar to courses that business students take," West said. "Hospitality faculty have similar credentials to business [faculty]. Our law professors can teach not only hotel law and travel law; they can also teach basic business law."

In the fall, some of the courses required by degree-seeking students in both schools, including some introductory marketing and management classes, will be co-listed as both business and hospitality management courses, said Lee Dickson, associate dean of SHM. 

An estimated 140 hospitality students taking management or marketing classes will be directly affected by the change, according to West. 

"I don't think we should be mixed here because this program is very direct," said Sharon Ehrnhardt, a senior and hospitality management major. "I don't see why business students should be taking classes with us. The instructors are going to be more broad instead of more specific."

There are currently about 825 hospitality management undergraduates and about 125 graduate students. There are about 8,000 business students at both campuses, 850-900 of which are based at BBC. 

An administration change will also result from the joining of the schools. West, who formerly presided only over SHM, will now also take on the role of CBA dean at BBC, though Joyce Elam, the executive dean of CBA at University Park, will remain in her position. Previously, there was no CBA dean at BBC, however Professor Lou Davidson did oversee the program. Davidson will continue to teach.

"This position opens up someone to speak to students, department chairs, deans, the provost, and the president," West said. "Basically, the purpose was to have someone who could operate at the highest levels, while still being committed to students."

"The provost is committed to enhancing BBC," he added. "So, since I'm already on the dean's council and the presidential council, if I'm going to be tasked with managing business programs, I would do so as dean because I'm already here." 

And yet another change is in the works for CBA. According to Steven Moll, professor and director of FIU's graduate hospitality program, some business faculty members are being reassigned to UP because CBA at BBC will now only offer degrees at the undergraduate level. SHM will continue to offer both undergraduate and graduate level classes at BBC.  

Moll himself relocated this week from his office in HM to Academic II, which houses the business school. Because of his prior experience managing an FIU program - for four years he was manager of the hospitality management program in Broward County - Moll was asked by West to assist him in running CBA.

Moll thinks the collaboration of the two schools will be a positive change and he said that the students who will be affected the most will be BBC business graduate students.

"The ones that really are going to be affected are those that might have been 

up here with a master's in business administration; those must now go to UP," Moll said. "You're not going to see any changes, if anything they're going to see hopefully better service, that's the reason why we've had this merger. . . to provide better customer service."

A likely result of the school merger is that class sizes will increase slightly because hospitality and business students will now share certain classes. This is not foreseen as a problem, however, as SHM is equipped with several classrooms that can fit 100 plus students. One advantage administrators cite is that business and hospitality students will gain access to facilities in both schools.  

"It's a mutually collaborative relationship," Dickson said. "They have a computer classroom in ACII and we have one here, so we'll work to link them so students will have access to any special software that they need."

Administrators in both schools are currently making plans for future structural alterations resulting from the merger. Eventually, the second floor of SHM will house BBC's business school. 

Other prospects include setting up an advising center in SHM that will be open to both business and hospitality students, as well as expanding the hospitality management club, Crossroads, to include business students.

"I, personally, am very, very anxious to really get moving ahead because I think you'll see more work between the faculty of the two programs in terms of generating articles and doing academic and scholarly research. The school will benefit in that SHM [students] can take CBA courses and vice versa," Moll said. "I hope that [students will] take advantage... getting more out of the limited resources we currently have."

For now, faculty members are working together to plan ahead for the changes that will occur in the fall.

"I'd like to think that people, at the end of the fall term, will think 'gee whiz...this is working pretty well,'" Dickson said.

Headline: FIU, UM set to resume basketball rivalry
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU and the University of Miami agreed on June 5 to a home-and-home men's basketball series that will start this season and continue next season.

FIU will make its first visit to the Hurricanes' new Convocation Center on Saturday, Dec. 6, which will mark the ninth meeting between the two sides.

The Golden Panthers will then host the Hurricanes at the Golden Panther Arena on a date yet to be determined in the 2004-05 campaign.

"Obviously this is a terrific thing for our program and South Florida," said FIU men's basketball coach Donnie Marsh.

Perry [Clark] and I talked about it, but a lot of the credit goes to [FIU Athletic Director] Rick Mello and [UM Athletic Director] Paul Dee," Marsh said.

FIU and UM have met only eight times in history, with the Hurricanes winning the most recent meeting, 77-59, on Dec. 3, 2001 at the Miami Arena.

Miami holds a 7-1 all-time record against FIU, with the Golden Panthers' only win coming on Dec. 1, 1992 when they defeated the Canes 72-64 at the Miami Arena.

Both teams are coming off sub par seasons, with FIU (8-21), and UM (11-16) both failing to reach the NCAA Tournament. 

When FIU hosts Miami in 2004, it will mark the first-ever meeting between the two teams at the Golden Panther Arena.

Marsh hopes to have the full blue and gold entourage in the stands for that game.

FIU holds a 140-100 all-time record at the Golden Panther Arena, but finished 5-9 last season, losing  seven consecutive games at home to end the season.

"We certainly expect to fill this place," Marsh said.

But first, the Panthers must enter UM's new Convocation Center this season, which might not feel like a road game, according to Coach Marsh.

"I hope our fans come out in force, to take over their Convocation Center, and give us the boost we need," Marsh said.

"Anytime you get a road game with as many fans as the other team, we can negate their home court advantage," Marsh said.

Miami finished 4-5 at home last season in its first year at the Convocation Center, after moving into the arena midway through the season.

UM's head men's basketball coach, Perry Clark, was out of town at a coach's meeting, and could not be reached for comment.

Added Marsh: "It will be very interesting. We're very excited about this."

Headline: Four Golden Panthers selected in Major League Baseball Draft
Subheadline: Pullin, Rivera honored as Freshman All-Americans
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers had four current players drafted on June 3 when Josh Banks, Ricardo Nanita, Arthur Santos, and Andrew Edwards were all selected in the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft.

Banks, a junior pitcher from Arnold, Md., became the highest selection in FIU history when he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the second round as the 50th overall selection.

Banks led FIU with an 8-3 record, tallying 114 strikeouts in 105.1 innings, while walking only 25 batters. 

Banks is expected to sign with the Blue Jays. 

"Josh just got steadily better since he's been here," said head baseball coach Danny Price.

"It's going to be tough to replace [Banks], but it will give someone else a chance to step in and play," added Price.

"But whenever a guy gets drafted as high as Josh did, you don't lose any sleep over that," said Price.

In addition to Banks, center fielder Ricardo Nanita was selected in the 14th round, 412th overall by the Chicago White Sox.

Nanita, a junior from Santo Domingo, DR, led the Golden Panthers in batting average (.388), homeruns (12), and RBI (52) in his first season at FIU.

"Ricardo called me on [Friday night] and informed me he's going to sign," Price said.

Edwards, a junior pitcher from Queens, NY, who was drafted last season by the Seattle Mariners in the 41st round, was taken in the 27th round, 814th overall by his hometown team, the New York Yankees.

Edwards, who was plagued with an injured elbow for the second straight year, struck out 31 batters with a 4.37 ERA in ten appearances for FIU this season.

Edwards, who is currently home in New York, is expected back next season, according to the team.

"Right now it looks like Edwards will be coming back next year," Price said.

Added Arthur Santos: "I can tell you right now that Andrew's coming back to school."

Santos, a junior pitcher, was the last Golden Panther selected, going in the 34th round, 1,014th overall, to the Boston Red Sox.

Santos (Miami/Goleman) finished the 2003 campaign with a 3.80 ERA and 58 strikeouts after becoming a permanent starter in the rotation late in the season, and has  signed with the Red Sox.

"I'm going to sign with Boston. I'm leaving to Massachusetts on Monday," said Santos.

"It's an honor. Not too many people can say they got drafted and got a chance to play professional baseball," Santos said.

With Santos  and Nanita leaving school, Price knows his former players will have their work cut out for them.

"I've seen a lot of players come and go," Price said. "But making it to the big leagues is like finding a needle in a haystack. You have to catch some breaks, and have some luck, no matter how good you are."

"It takes tremendous talent and tremendous luck to get to the Majors," added Price.

"I just hate to see a kid sign for a low amount of money, and sell themselves short," said Price. "But I'm very proud of my guys."

Pullin, Rivera honored

The baseball team rolled in two more honors on Thursday when first baseman/designated hitter Bryan Pullin and shortstop Luis Rivera were named "Louisville Slugger" Freshman All-Americans by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper.

Pullin (Sunrise, Fla./American Heritage), batted .322 for the Golden Panthers this season, primarily in the designated hitter role, seeing limited time at first base.

Pullin, also a member of the All-Sun Belt Conference's first team, finished the season with 23 RBI, eight doubles, 48 hits, and six stolen bases.

Rivera (Carolina, Puerto Rico), led the team in hits (83), doubles (15), and had  a 23-game hitting streak.

He also led the team in games played (58) and at-bats (246), batting .337 with 41 runs and 14 stolen bases, in addition to being named Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year.

Headline: Track and Field fails to qualify for NCAA Championships at Regionals
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers traveled to Fairfax, VA. on  May 29 to take part in the NCAA Regionals, with all ten competitors failing to advance to the NCAA Championships at Sacramento State University on June 11.

Out of the ten who qualified for the event, only Vronique Wilson was able to advance to the Regional finals, after finishing fourth in the 200-meter dash on the first day of Regionals with a time of 23:34.

However, in the Regional finals, Wilson failed to qualify for the NCAA Championships when she finished in seventh place in the 200-meter dash, with a time of 23:88, two spots out of qualifying status.

"She had an average performance, but she had a lot of things on her mind with graduation, and getting a new job and everything," said head coach Jessica Carter.

"The second day, she looked very tired. I think she would have finished in the top three if she didn't have other things on her mind," said Carter.

Wilson also ran in the 100-meter dash, with a time of 11.78 and a 12th place finish.

Anita Edwards also ran two meets, the 200-meter dash with a time of 24:05 and the 400-meter dash with a time of 56.54, with both performances failing to make the qualifying time.

Edwards also joined Alexia Dean, Sonii McBride, and Wilson in the 4x400-meter relay, with the crew finishing in 17th place with a time of 3:42.52, 7.07 seconds behind first place South Carolina.

"We qualified in the relay, but we won't be going because Vronique is starting a new job," said Carter.

"But it was pretty rough. The girls looked really flat, but it's been a tough season," said Carter.

Ranada Daniels ran in the 400-meter hurdles, but came up short with a time of 1:01.33.

Michelle Lennox also had a rough outing, failing to qualify in the pole vault after three attempts.

"Michelle had a death 

TRACK, from page 8



in the family right before, so it was tough to expect anything from her," said Carter.

Linda Louissaint competed in two events, finishing 10th in the high jump with a height of 1.71 meters, and 18th in the triple jump with a distance of 12.14 meters,but couldn't qualify.

"I thought Linda did very well," Carter said. "She placed ninth overall.

On the men's side, Yandiel Muniz placed 15th in the high jump, clearing the 6'08" mark.

"It was tough for Yandiel, because the opening height was his personal best," said Carter.

Also on the men's side, Terah Dardy ran the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 53:17.

"Terah missed the finals because he hit a hurdle really bad," Carter said.

Jamare Clarington, the final male competitor, ran the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 15:07, also failing to reach the finals.

 "When you run the hurdles, you have to have a flawless race, and Jamare hit the first hurdle," said Carter.

"But he was just coming off a hamstring injury," added Carter.

Only the top five individuals in each competition and eight "wild cards" earned the right to go to California.

With the team not advancing to the NCAA Championships,  FIU's season is over.

"We just didn't have much time to recover from the conference championship," Carter said.

"It's been a really long season, but overall I think we had a great year," Carter said. "Sometimes it just goes like that," said Carter.

Added Carter: "Next year we can do a lot better."

"We'll be losing Anita Edwards and Vronique Wilson, but I still think we can improve," Carter said.

Headline: Casanova, FIU baseball part ways
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Rolando Casanova resigned from the baseball team on June 5 after serving the team for 24 years as an assistant to head coach Danny Price.

"We're very comfortable with things. [Casanova] is going to pursue other things," said Price on Friday.

"They thought we should make the change, and I agreed with them," Casanova said on Friday.

"It's a situation where it's not about me and Danny. It's about the program, and nobody is bigger than the program," Casanova said.

"You have to remember, I played here and coached here, and I want nothing but for this program to succeed," Casanova said.

"You won't see me disappear. I have a son on the team, so I'll be a fan," added Casanova.

 Casanova's son, Adrian, is a backup catcher on the team.

"I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me wearing any other team's [apparel]," he added.

Still, it is unclear exactly why Casanova and FIU are suddenly parting ways after Casanova participated 26 years at FIU as a player and coach.

"Danny's at a curve where he felt he needed to make a move," Casanova said. "But there's obviously no bad blood."

Said Price: "We're on the same page."

As far as where Casanova goes from here, he says whatever it is, baseball will definitely be involved.

"Baseball is my love," said Casanova.

However, Casanova, who has held four other coaching positions in addition to FIU, says he's not interested in coaching for the time being.

"No, coaching is not in my plans," Casanova said.

"But I consider myself a pretty good baseball contact, and whether it's professional or private, I'll be involved with the game," he added.

Casanova, who was born and raised in Miami, and played his high school ball at Loyola High, played second base for FIU in 1977.

He has served baseball as an assistant coach at St. Thomas University in 1978, and as head coach in Loyola in 1980.

In addition to coaching for FIU, Casanova also was the head coach for the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod League from 1989-91, and the led the Orleans Cardinals from 1992-96.

But Casanova, 44, is best known for boasting the longest tenure of any athletic assistant coach at FIU, as Price's full-time assistant for  almost three decades.

Said Price: "[Casanova] and I are great friends, and will remain great friends."

Headline: Basketball signs juco-star to bolster backcourt
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Head men's basketball coach Donnie Marsh announced the signing of junior college transfer Marcus Robinson last month, a move that is expected to improve the team's backcourt.

Robinson, a 6-foot, 175 pound guard from Mesa, Arizona, led Division II in scoring last season at South Mountain Community College, averaging 25.6 points per game.

"Marcus is a natural scorer. He can shoot and has range. He is really going to help this team push the ball and play the style of ball we want to play," said Marsh.

Robinson, who Marsh compares to Damon Stoudamire of the NBA's Portland Trailblazers, will play point guard and shooting guard for FIU.

"He's very good in the open floor, and he will help get us dribble penetration buckets with his up-tempo game," Marsh said.

"He just knows how to run the floor and he sees his teammates extremely well," added Marsh.

"He's also very strong for his size. He bench presses 260 pounds," Marsh said.

Marsh hopes the addition of a scoring guard will also free up some of his other players.

"I think teams will have to focus in on Marcus, and that will free up Matias and Morban, and help them play more to their strengths," said Marsh.

Robinson, who was named third team All-America and first-team All-ACCAC as the league's top vote-getter last season, will be given an opportunity to come in and start, according to Coach Marsh.

"He's got to come in and earn it. If he proves he's the best at his position, then it's his," said Marsh.

"But we expect him to come in and make an immediate impact."

Robinson is expected to join the team mid-summer.

"We expect him in before Summer B, and from there he will start lifting weights and stuff like that, and get to know the guys," Marsh said.

"We're looking forward to Marcus joining us," Marsh said.

Headline: New softball/tennis complex under construction at University Park
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Construction is underway on a new complex that will serve the softball and tennis programs. 

The 3,000 square-foot building will be located on the west side of University Park, just south of the tennis courts and softball field. 

The one-story building will provide locker rooms, a training room, an equipment room, offices for the softball and tennis programs, and public restrooms.

J. Acevedo Construction, which has already added a press box in addition to upgrading the dugouts and backstops on the softball field, plans to finish construction by January 1, 2004.

Bart Mondell, Assistant Athletic Director of Facilities and Events, is hopeful the construction will be complete by the set date.

"We hope to have the building occupied by January 2004. That is our goal," Mondell said.

According to Mondell, the project is expected to cost close to $550,000, with most of the funds coming from the Department of Athletics budget, and the rest being offered from capital improvement funds allocated by the university.

"The construction part is going to cost close to $420,000, and we plan on spending another $100,000 or so on equipment for the facility," Mondell said.

"In the end, we'll probably be spending close to $550,000 in total expenses," added Mondell. 

Head softball coach Kim Gwydir hopes the facility will provide future benefits for the 6-year-old program.

"To be a top-notch program, you need top-notch facilities, and that's what this is," said Gwydir.

"This will give us our own space, and I'm really excited about that," Gwydir added.

Both Gwydir and head tennis coach Ronni Bernstein also expect the new building to improve recruiting efforts. 

"It brings a lot to recruiting, to have a facility to show the recruits, and it will really make the girls already here feel more comfortable," said Bernstein.

"It should make a huge difference for our program. It's very exciting," she added.

"Starting this fall, the Department of Education's rejig of a 
formula governing financial aid will reduce by "hundreds 
of millions of dollars" the government's contributions to 
higher education, The New York Times reports. The 
Times says the changes "will also have a ripple effect 
across almost every level of financial aid, shrinking the 
pool of students who qualify for federal awards, 
tightening access to billions of dollars in state and 
institutional grants and, in turn, heightening the reliance 
on loans to pay for college." How much extra each 
student's family will have to shell out annually depends 
on each student's situation, from under $100 to more 
than $1,000. (The Times walks you through it.) 

Democrats are already scrambling to derail this attempt 
to cut education spending via the back door. George 
Miller, the California Democrat, is calling for hearings in 
the House. Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts on 
Monday introduced a bill, S. 1268, to block what amounts 
to an education tax hike. Kennedy accused the Bush 
Administration of having "covered up the changes in 
obscure technical modifications in tables in the Federal 
Register," and notes the Administration is "quietly closing 
the door to college for millions of needy students."

Headline: Tuition Increase
Subheadline:  
Author: maseman1@hotmail.com
&nbsp;
Hello, I am an undergraduate international student.  I am writing this message with the purpose of asking The Beacon to write an article on tuition increase and how much more of an increase is for international students.  Here in the university they talk with percentages.  Well 5% of an in-state tuition credit is much less than a 5% of an out-state tuition credit.  We already pay $400 dollars per credit and with this increase the only thing they are doing is making people drop from college because they lack the sufficient funds to attend this university.
I would appreciate if something regarding this topic is investigated and posted and with this maybe bring some sense to the group of people that are responsible for this.
Thank You.

I noticed a certain lack of coverage of the good literary stuff going on at the Biscayne campus in the Beacon.  I would be really interested in writing about the 1) talented writing profs 2) exciting writing speakers that come to visit/speak on campus 3) the stuff writing students/grads are doing.  Are you interested? Let me know. I'm an English major, junior and love to write. I'm thinking the occasional profile of a visiting author or campus author or student or grad author and a listing of Writer's on the Bay events.  What do you think?

Headline: International Student Services
Subheadline:  
Author: arvi.arunachalam@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
Dear Editor,
I wish to thank you for bringing to spotlight on the International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) office a few weeks earlier. Though the article reflected the difficulties faced by students in getting a good service, i wish to make the following observations.

1. FIU has a total of 3741 international students, that's approximately 11% of the total student population. Every ninth student in FIU is international. (Source: Office of Institutional Research)

2. It's real pity that the FIU has not done much to ameliorate, unburden, the overworked, under-appreciated, often criticized staff at the ISSS office.

3. There are only 3 advisors at the ISSS ofice who are eligible to advise the 3741 international students at FIU. (As per the new regulations of Department of Homeland Security).  They are Dr. 
Ana Sippin, the Director, Ms. Maria Leviste, Associate Director and Ms. Sandy Hall, Coordinator. There's no doubt that they are continuing to a tremendous job with such limited resources. 

Imagine serving the needs of 3741 students by just 3 advisors!!!

4. The current office is so small and cramped that even five students at the desk seems like an impending stampede. It's high time that the FIU Administration takes note of the plight of ISSS 
office, provides them with a well deserved much larger office space through the new GC expansion plan. 

5. The support staff in ISSS office total only three, one of whom is the SEVIS coordinator, a part time program assistant and a secretary. Besides them, a few student assistants (three 
undergraduate assistants and two graduate assistants) are doing their best to serve the students.

Despite all these limitations, i believe ISSS staff have continued to provide outstanding service to the ever growing international student population. I certainly believe that ISSS office deserves more credits than criticisms as it always does. 

As an international student, my biggest draw to FIU is the incredible diversity of student population. In order to make FIU really  "International" the focal point of any change would be to help the ISSS office, staff more people to serve the students much more effectively.

I hope all international students understand and appreciate the constraints under which the ISSS operates. Hopefully, the FIU administration really reaches out to expand the ISSS office, brings 
in more advisors and helps the ISSS to serve the students even better. Until then we all have to be patient and keeps our fingers crossed.

I'll admit it: I'm something of a foreigner to FIU. As a transient student, I'm finding the school to be a world apart from the University of Florida in Gainesville, where I will be a senior in the fall. In comparison, this place is tiny, nearly dormless, and eerily quiet. Granted, it is the summer term, so a smaller student population is to be expected. 

However, I also have to remind myself that FIU is significantly newer. Only 31-years-old, the University Park campus was made up entirely of commuters until its first housing complex, University Park Apartments, was built in 1986. Since then, it has opened three other residence halls: Panther Hall, University Park Towers, and Everglades Hall. UF, by contrast, is celebrating its 250th anniversary this year, and its residence hall count comes to 29. I can tell you first hand that people don't just go to the school. They live it. 

I definitely felt I was getting the prototypical "college experience" living in Gainesville; UF has had time to become rich in history and tradition, its school spirit has flourished, and its football team has made a name for itself (not that it interests me). 

Gainesville is the University of Florida, inescapably. The universe there is orange, blue, and reptilian. This can, admittedly, become sickening, but I suppose it's nice that people can get so enthused about school. It wouldn't be complete without at least one year of dorm life, however. 

Living on campus was an "experience," as they say. I was fortunate enough to land a spot in Hume Hall, the newly built honors dorm with suite-style rooms. 

This meant no one had ever slept in my bed, hung Britney posters on my walls, or puked on my rug after an evening of binge drinking. The room itself aside, though, the scariest part of dorm life is the completely random roommates you're assigned; you really have no idea what you're getting into when it comes to housing. Being the staunch anti-Greek I am, it didn't surprise me that I ended up sharing a suite with three sorority girls. While I won't name names, suffice it to say I dealt with more than my fair share of blond, bubbly Greek drama in a 12-by-15 foot space. I can recommend a good set of headphones.

I am therefore thrilled to be home, where my bedroom is unshared and undisturbed. My mom's food never tasted better, I can play my music without potentially bothering or offending anyone, and I don't have to go to sleep with the lights on while my roommate stays up cramming until 3 a.m.  

There are upsides to living on campus, though. You have the benefit of being able to roll out of bed and right into class, and, as one of my UF friends points out, the freedom of being away from home and the bizarre rules your parents impose on you. However, there is something to be said for not living at school. Looking out the window on a Saturday to see the journalism building you drag yourself to at 8:30 a.m. every day of the week can become tiresome in no time at all. 

At FIU, I have the distinct luxury of distancing myself from all things academic when my school day is over. I go to class and come home, and I find it a refreshing change. To my thinking, this is because FIU is not home to most people. 

I can't see how the school could develop many more residence halls, considering its size, and I'm not even sure why it would want to. After all, FIU was touted as one of the top 10 public commuter schools in the country by Money magazine and should be proud of it. 

Besides, it has plenty of other perks. For example, I appreciate the subdued nature of Greek life here; the constant assault by Gammas and Deltas at UF is not one of its strong points. 

While there are 28 fraternities and sororities at FIU, they aren't as annoyingly pervasive as they are in Gainesville. 

I can stand a Greek letter on a t-shirt here and there, but I can do without seeing Sigma Chis sprawled in kiddie pools on their frat house lawn when I'm walking to class. 

The way I understand it, there is one Greek house on the FIU campus, and I have yet to even see it.

The school also has the benefit of being in Miami, where there is more than one concert venue, an entire newspaper page with movie listings, and considerably fewer Waffle Houses. Gainesville has one mall and an inordinate amount of drunkenness, so being home requires far less creativity in terms of finding things to do.

As much as I am enjoying my summer in Miami, though, I occasionally find myself missing Gainesville slightly. 

The place, although small and easily pegged as boring, does possess a certain charm. It has Leonardo's, a great Italian restaurant with a café where the chai tea is perfect. It averages about 40 degrees in the fall, and rain clouds are an anomaly. It also boasts the Hippodrome, easily the greatest indie-film theater ever, where students get in for $3.50 on Tuesdays. 

I've carved out a niche there, so going back in the fall won't be too tragic.

Seeing the big-city commuter side of university life has been a welcome change, but living in a college town does have its appeal. 

The dorms have taken their toll on me, though. Come fall, I'll be charting another foreign territory: apartment living.

Headline: Editorial: Hospitality management, business merger poses problems
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The School of Hospitality Management and the College of Business Administration at the Biscayne Bay Campus are set to merge.

The CBA, unable to staff its program adequately has turned to the SHM for help. 

The result behind the resourceful thinking should be that SHM professors will face a  heavier load, while the CBA should be able to free up some of its professors to offer other courses. 

There is, of course, the obvious question of class size. Administrators believe their facilities can handle it. The faculty, likely, won't look forward to teaching another section, and personal attention should be all but gone.

This does not bode well for students in larger classes.

Some students believe that the result may be overloaded professors and generalized material. While hospitality management professors may be knowledgeable enough to teach business classes, if business students are also taking their classes, the classes will no longer be geared towards hospitality management students, likely, who may suffer from the more generalized courses.

And while these common sense complaints are, after all, simple speculation, there is one other factor that certainly isn't: Students who had hoped to obtain their graduate-level diplomas in business administration at BBC will have to continue their education at University Park. The certain casualty of the decision, the graduate program at BBC, was axed.

While there may be growing pains, it is possible, however, that the positives may outweigh the negatives.

Headline: Peer Advisor Profile: Marlene Quincoces
Author: Adrina Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Chosen for her devotion and dedication to FIU's community, Marlene Quincoces is one of the newest peer advisors who will be representing the student body and encouraging new FIU students at freshmen and transfer orientations for the 2003-2004 school year. 

Marly, as Quincoces is affectionately known, "is the epitome of a peer advisor," said Charles Andrews, assistant director of Orientation and Commuter Services. "She's perky, organized, highly involved, and, above all, has managed to sustain an outstanding GPA."

According to Quincoces, having already received so much from the university, she decided to become a peer advisor so that she could give back what was so generously given to her and encourage others to become leaders and to get involved.

"I believe the way you are introduced to a university really establishes whether or not you feel at home and at your best to shine, or whether it's just another place to come learn and work," Quincoces said. "Exhibiting energy and enthusiasm to students of leadership potential is something that I hold dear to my heart, especially if it's giving back to a university that's given me so much in such a short amount of time."

Quincoces, chosen as an advisor in her freshman year, and now a sophomore, was already involved in the FIU community when she learned of the vacant position to head the first FIU American Heritage festivities. After being interviewed, she was assigned her duties the same day.

"I was planning for an enormous event by myself before I even knew the campus or the students," Quincoces said. 

According to Andrews, Quincoces' early involvement at FIU significantly contributed to her consideration for peer advisor. 

"We always try to have diversity among our peer advisors so that the incoming students can find someone to relate to. One of the tons of reasons we chose Marly was also because of [her involvement]. Who better to relate to students than someone who has been super-active in school and knows how to manage it all and not let her grades slip?" Andrews said. 

Aside from her current involvement as a peer advisor, Quincoces organized American Heritage, held in fall 2002, and was the entertainment chairperson for FIU's main philanthropy this spring, Dance Marathon. 

"Dance Marathon was crazy but great. My tasks were mainly to plan the 25 hours of non-stop entertainment," Quincoces said. 

Because of her involvement and her capability to manage her time while maintaining a 3.5 GPA, Quincoces received, in her first year at FIU, the FIU Student Life Award for Outstanding Freshman in a pool of over 11,000 students. She is also a recipient of the Coca-Cola Scholarship and The Gates Millennium Scholarship.

Aside from engaging in challenging school activities and maintaining her grades, Quincoces also has four jobs and performs services for her Miami Lakes community. 

"Outside of school I hold a few jobs to support my family," Quincoces said.

Quincoces works 30 hours weekly a as store manager. She also waitresses, plans and coordinates vacations for high schools and colleges, and serves as a student product manager of Red Bull Energy Drink, for which she coordinates yearly events that are to be sponsored by the company.

Outside of academics and secular responsibilities, Quincoces has also volunteered four times with the Miami Lakes Relay for Life. She is also active in the Civic Association Center and a few other small organizations that carry out community service projects.

"I live for service. I've been blessed with way too much to just sit down and reap benefits. I need to give back. I gain personal insight, understanding, and a greater appreciation of life and humility from every activity and service project. I'm just looking to gain experience and devote more passion to making this world a better place, or knowing someone has breathed easier due to my efforts. That's more than enough," Quincoces said.

Headline: Food vendors shorten service hours; students, staff complain
Author: John Morris/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The food courts at both the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses are leaving students hungry due to shorter summer hours. 

UP's food court, which normally closes at 8 p.m. in fall and spring, will have three two-hour shifts, beginning Summer B, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with the dinner shift ending at 7 p.m.  BBC's food court closes its doors at 2:30 p.m. for the summer, instead of the usual closing time of 6:30 p.m.

According to BBC food court management, the food court hours have been shortened so much because summer students are not buying.  This can likely be attributed to the estimated 25,000 summer students, in comparison to the estimated 33,000 spring students.

Food court staff is concerned about the slow business that occurs after the noon peak hours. 

According to Arthur Sternberg, BBC Food Service director, summer sales at BBC are down 28 percent, in comparison to last summer. 

Because of the slow business, employee hours have been cut.

"Business has been so slow. Normally, I'm working overtime. But now, I just work regular shifts," said Rosie Seymour, BBC Oasis manager.  "It doesn't seem like that many students are here because not many are buying food."

Other food services hours have been shortened as well.  UP's Gracie's Grill closes at 3 p.m., Java City at 6 p.m., and Subway and Pollo Tropical at 5 p.m. The official hours of BBC's Oasis are now 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

According to BBC food management, a decision was made to close the Oasis on Fridays because business has gone down so much.  The oasis makes only $80 to $100 in sales on Fridays.

Some students do not seem to acknowledge the food court during summer hours.

"Students come for their classes, and then just leave," said Linda Prida, BBC Food Service assistant director.  "People don't stick around to eat, and if they do, they sometimes bring their lunch from home."

FIU has made many attempts to increase food court business over the past year.   New food selections were added at BBC, including sushi, and the veggie bar which was open for a brief time in the spring.

"We were throwing out more food then we were selling," Sternberg said.  "It wasn't worth it." 

The staff has been observing different times at the food court and the Oasis in order to decide which are most profitable and how long they can remain open without losing money.

"The first week, we saw that people who had classes ending at 4:45 [p.m.] were coming by wanting food.  So we started staying open after 4 [p.m.], in hopes to catch this crowd," Sternberg said.

Many students who attend late classes want to see longer hours.

"I have a class at 5 [p.m.], and sometimes I want to eat before I go to class.  The shortened hours are really a hassle," said junior Brenda Adrianzen.

FIU staff sometimes work late and would like longer available services.

"I don't like everything closing so early.  I sometimes work until 7 [p.m.], and I want to get coffee, but they're closed already," said Donna Yff, associate director of Registration.

With more students arriving for Summer B, Sternberg says he hopes for more sales for the remainder of the summer so that food services can stay open longer.

Headline: UP awaits new recreation center
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a few years of planning, construction for a new, two-story recreation center at University Park is expected to begin in August and end in fall 2004.

"The plan had been in the works for a couple of years even before the building itself was actually designed," said Steve Hawkins, a project manager in the Facilities Management department.

The new facility will occupy a combined area of 13,000 square feet for exclusively FIU students.

"The demand [for fitness facilities] has increased since the Student Fitness Center was built [in 1995]," said Rob Frye, the director of Campus Recreation, noting that the current gym services up to 1,000 people each day. 

Because of varsity sports and graduation at the end of the spring semester, Campus Recreation rarely gets the opportunity to utilize the rest of the Golden Panther Arena. 

"Each year we're getting less time available to us for recreational use," Frye said.

The project will cost approximately $8.9 million, funds which will come from the Florida Capital Improvement Fund, Hawkins said.

Students welcome the idea of a larger, better-equipped fitness resource.

"This [current gym] is small. During rush hour it gets pretty packed," said junior Yuniel Usin.

Still, extra space is not the only aspect of the new recreation center that students look forward to.

"The new gym will be more motivating. I always felt that the Student Fitness Center was more geared toward guys. It won't be like this in the new gym because planners will try to attract more people, guys and girls alike," said senior Fanny Corzon. 

Upon the completion of the building, the Student 

Fitness Center, currently located in a corner of the 

Golden Panther Arena, will significantly expand. 

The Campus Recreation department, which is housed on the second floor of the current Student Fitness Center, will relocate to an office on the first floor of the new facility.	

According to Frye, in addition to new offices, the first floor of the new facility will provide free weights, a pro shop and equipment checkout.

Einstein Bagels will open an eatery accessible from both inside and outside the gym on the first floor as well, where visitors can purchase bagels, coffee or any other item on the menu. 

A large, two-court basketball gym will be located on one side of the first floor. The second floor will overlook it. 

"Right now I play basketball at home but once the new gym opens, I can go more often and play there," said junior Carlos Guerrero.

On the second floor, visitors will find cardiovascular maintenance machines such as treadmills, steppers and elliptical trainers in much more quantity than is currently available.

Two exercise studios, each measuring 1,500 square feet, will also be available for aerobics classes on this floor, Frye said. A curtain will separate the two studios, which will provide the option of doubling the size of the room.

A quieter area for those who are more reserved, and also for personal trainers and their clients, will also be found on the second floor, Frye said. 

According to Frye, only the newest pieces of equipment in the current gym will be moved to the new facility.

There is one problem, though. Parking is expected to be somewhat of a hassle during the construction, although Frye promises that some of the spaces will remain.

"Some parking is going to be displaced. Plus, you have to add the construction of the two new parking garages," Hawkins said.

Still, administration remains optimistic.

"Being so close to the residence halls, many visitors will be able to walk," Frye said. 

Students do not seem to mind the parking problem much either.

"The parking problem will be worth the new gym," Corzon said. 

The new parking garages, which are also projected to be complete by fall 2004, are expected to provide more parking options for students and faculty.

Headline: Finding Nemo
Subheadline: Saltwater sensation meets with success
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Who would have thought a gang of fishes would have beat out "The One" and even God at the box office? 

That's exactly what happened this week when Pixar and Disney released the saltwater sensation, "Finding Nemo." Another fully digitally-animated cartoon made its mark on the box office its opening weekend, grossing $70 million.   

The gentle story about a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and his lost son, Nemo (voiced by newcomer Alexander Gould) won the hearts of kids and adults alike. 

The movie has a Bambi-like feel in the beginning that makes the clown fish, and the audience, lose their sense of humor. Even with this gloomy beginning, the movie manages to move the plot along smoothly. 

With every frame, the movie makes the sea look like New York City. Busy street lights are replaced with bright red fish. Apartments are replaced by well-furnished and affordable coral reefs. 

School buses are replaced by friendly manta rays.  The school curriculum includes sea exploration and the life cycle of the sea urchin.  Every house is very affordable and in great habitat condition. 

It's the perfect neighborhood.

With that said, no neighborhood is complete with out the "bad side of town." That's where all of the predators live, including humans. This is where the movie plugs the whole animal rights issue, but what Disney movie isn't complete without its moral? 

This bad side of town is also where little Nemo gets lost and taken to a  fish tank where he meets a delightful crew of exotic fishes, including a  cute puffer fish, Bloat, voiced by Brad Garrett from "Everybody Loves Raymond."

Meanwhile, back in oceanic suburbia, Marlin's only hope in finding his son is to swim across the sea. 

With a little help from his new-found friend Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres) who suffers from short-term memory loss, Marlin embarks on a journey worthy of recognition. 

They encounter everything from guilt-ridden sharks to surfing turtles. Quite the epic journey for two tiny reef fish.

"Finding Nemo" is a definite must-see. It has the perfect combination of adult, kid and aquatic humor. 

A mixture of quirky situations and solid wit make this movie different from a lot of animated films. 

After a while, you forget you have been looking at fish for the past hour and a half. Small details in the way the fish look, move and act add to the movie's appeal. 

Even the conversations that the fish have make sense. If you were a fish you would definitely want to be in this movie.

The movie does have its share of tear jerking moments but, they are perfectly timed. The audience never gets bored with the lessons that are being taught because they get involved with the characters.  

You feel bad for Marlin when he loses his son. You feel bad for the fish in the tanks trying to get out. In a way everyone can relate to at least one aspect of "Finding Nemo," even if you aren't five. 

This movie is a truly great experience that makes you think twice about eating at Long John Silver's or flushing Bubbles down the toilet. 

It makes you feel for the little guys, go vegetarian and buy more movie tickets.

Headline: Field Day fraught with problems,bands save the day
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Who knew staging a two-day, musically revolutionizing, event-of-the-decade concert with an expected turnout in the several thousands could be so difficult? I am, of course, speaking of the first Field Day Music Festival which took place, not as originally planned, on June 7 at the Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

The original plan for Field Day was breathtaking. With the amount of musically-rich, quality acts scheduled to perform and the all-round friendly and peaceful vibe the festival prided itself with, I had no doubt in my mind that it would become our generation's Woodstock.  Scheduled to perform were bands who are making a difference in the industry and actively changing the way people create, listen and absorb music.

That was how it was supposed to and should have gone down, but unfortunately, that concept was merely nothing but a rough draft. The final version of Field Day was thrust out only three days prior to show time.  On June 4, an announcement was made that the concert was unable to be held in Long Island due to a problem with attaining certain permits or securities and the entire festival was relocated to Giants Stadium. 

Ticket-holders were forced to buy new tickets if they still wanted to attend and almost half of the amazing music line-up dropped from the schedule, making the once two-day event into a one-day concert.  

These were not just little side bands who dropped either. I'm speaking about The Streets, Sígor Ros, Blackalicious, Ben Kweller, The Roots, Interpol, Le Tigre, The Tratchenburg Family Slideshow Players and a few more.  The remaining bands consisted of Radiohead, The Beastie Boys, Beck, Blur, Underworld, Spiritualized, Elliott Smith, Beth Orton, Liz Phair, Bright Eyes, Thursday, My Morning Jacket, Gemma Hayes, 22-20s and Ours.  

Not too shabby, but definitely not what was going to make the original concert so amazing.  Aside from that, the overnight camping and large grassy fields would have created a much nicer atmosphere than the one that actually greeted the crowd. Aside from Giants Stadium being not the prettiest of venues, it was an ugly day.   It rained, nonstop, for hours and hours; a steady drizzle of cold rain with rain clouds that never budged an inch. It was incredibly dreary and I forced myself to miss most of the second stage bands to prevent coming down with pneumonia. The few bands I did catch on the second stage only had about 20 minutes to play.  Ours, for example, only played four songs, while Thursday could only squeeze in five. And even the bigger main stage bands such as Blur just didn't really give a great vibe. One could easily tell they were just as displeased as the crowd was.

Just as I thought things couldn't get any worse, right as I was climbing a mountain of excitement to see Beck, an announcement was made that Beck has been seriously injured and would no longer perform. I almost thought I would cry, not just because I'd be missing Beck, but simply because it was yet another let-down.  The crowd wasn't happy either, as I remember hearing sarcastic predictions that the Beastie Boys would probably fall and cancel as well.

Luckily, The Beastie Boys and Radiohead saved the festival. I, having driven over 1,500 miles to see this thing, felt kind of shafted right until these final two acts. 

For about four hours, the two groups miraculously made it all worthwhile. The Beastie Boys have not lost their spunk one bit, playfully jumping around stage, being silly and belting out both old and newer raps which inspired an irresistible urge to bounce.  

As a finale, Radiohead took the stage; their performance can best be described as a musical orgasm. Thom York and his excellent band really know how to make a presence and play really damn good music. With a very well-strung together set-list comprised of old and new tunes, an impressive light-show and a very friendly feel, it was an amazing sight to see. They even played "Talk Show Host," quite possibly my favorite song. It's difficult choosing words to describe the awesome power this band has for a live performance; there simply aren't enough ways to say it.

Regardless of the semi-tragedy Field Day became, it's hard to say seeing Radiohead and the Beastie Boys was a let-down.  They almost completely made up for the entirety of Field Day's failure. 

Hopefully, the festival will occur again next summer with the kinks worked out and the problems addressed ahead of time instead of three days prior. No one should be blamed directly, these things do happen of course, but it doesn't make the situation any less painful. Although I have doubts as to whether Field Day will happen again, if it does and it promises another awe-inspiring line up of bands, I will certainly attend.

Headline: Spunky Pretty Girls advance female rock image
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Someone asked me the other day what was up with the recent hard-on for rock and roll?  I think there's a more interesting topic of discussion: What's up with the recent hard-on for female singers in rock and roll?  

Now, don't get me wrong, girls can sing better rock than boys any day, it's just becoming one of those fads angry music journalists such as myself tend to grow weary of.  Are we already starting to see certain repercussions with over-hyped and overproduced bands?  Maybe, but such is certainly not the case with Seattle's Pretty Girls Make Graves. (I won't write about how cool of name that is).

This beat-rock quintet opened, unfortunately, for indie pop-punkers Alkaline Trio on May 31. The talented Alkaline Trio may have a new record out, but it comes at a time when music and its unconditional lovers are beginning to need something more than what Good Mourning has to offer.  The music world wants movement. As decent a performance as Alkaline Trio put on, Pretty Girls moved the crowd, if only for 20 minutes; something the music of bands like Alkaline Trio could never really achieve.

That is, in essence, what makes Pretty Girls Make Graves so much more special than crowd-magnets such as Alkaline Trio.  I know as soon as I mentioned the words "girl," "indie" and "rock," readers would think Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sleater-Kinney or even Bikini Kill. Forget those bands because they sound absolutely nothing like Pretty Girls. Led by the adorably iron-willed Andrea Zollo and co-songwriter/singer/bassist/rock-veteran Derek Fudesco, the band adopts a slightly pop feel that lingers politely in the background of the not-always-so-polite, hard-biting, semi-electro bounce coherent with their technique.

Complete with even keyboard and samples, Pretty Girls Make Graves completely shook the walls of the tiny and hellishly hot Factory nightclub. What I appreciated most about the band is their lack of pizzazz and grandeur.  Sure they've got plenty of spunk, but they aren't full of themselves.    

Keep your eyes peeled for these girls, with a new album due out in early September, I'm sure you'll be hearing the buzz about Pretty Girls soon.

Headline: 3eb lacks energy at local concert
Author: Sarah Rodriguez/BBC News Editor
&nbsp;
When a band I especially love takes their time in releasing a long-awaited album, I offer my patience, understanding that the process of creating music is a complex one.  Luckily, Third Eye Blind left for their fans self-titled and Blue - their first two albums - to revel in while waiting excitedly yet contentedly for their third to hit stores.   

With the release of their third album, Out of the Vein, Third Eye Blind has been touring with their new guitarist, Tony Fredianelli, and on June 6 visited our neck of the woods. When I found out that 3eb would be playing at the Pompano Beach Amphitheatre I knew I'd be there.  

I was surprised when I saw how diverse the crowd was; I half expected to be run over by 14-year-old girls screaming "Stephan, we love you!" Seemingly, however, 3eb devotees in the South Florida area aren't few, and they come in all ages, colors and sizes.

The opening act was 22-year-old Josh Kelly on an acoustic guitar backed by a three-piece band, which was a cross between the Wallflowers and Blues Traveler; Kelly's deep rasp, however, reminded me of the rising pop-star John Mayer.  

After an hour of Kelly, and a couple of minutes of setup, 3eb finally came out, and a wave of fans rushed towards the stage.  

By the time Jenkins had reached his microphone and the band got into playing "Blinded," I had been kicked out of the seat that I hoped no one would realize wasn't mine.  I understood that I wouldn't be sitting back in serenity while I watched this show - no, I'd be rubbing sweaty elbows with fellow fans all night. 

They went through a 19-song set composed mostly from self-titled and Out of the Vein - not nearly enough from Blue for my taste, but the crowd seemed to enjoy themselves.

Though the band played for nearly two hours, I couldn't help but notice that a certain energy was lacking in the performance; the energy level did not compare to that of their performance last year in Miami during the Beyond 2001 tour, during which  Stephan skipped across stage wearing a top hat and twirling a cane between his fingers (this of course, when he wasn't playing guitar).

Jenkins remained fairly sedentary throughout the show, except to lean forward to touch some fans' hands, but he did let out several of those straight-from-the-gut screams that we fans enjoy so much.  

For the most part, the guys were loyal to the recorded versions of their songs, though they've been known to play around with the music, adding extended guitar solos and reciting lyrics never before heard. 

They put on a great show but I have to admit that the new album doesn't quite live up to its predecessors.  I would never refer to it as pop, but would simply say that the songs are catchier and more upbeat, with fewer instrumental solos, and less strength in Jenkins' vocals.   The new album certainly does come out of a vein, but not the same one that produced self-titled and Blue.

I felt privileged to be so close to a band that I feel has put nothing less than what they had to offer in their music - and it's a lot.  Those who know nothing more of 3eb than radio songs such as "Semi-Charmed Kind of Life" (which has its own genius to it), and "I'll Never Let You Go" (which many of us would rather soon forget) are missing out on lyrical creativity, and musical intensity and ingenuity.  The men are back, and though not better than ever, among the best I've ever heard.

Headline: Summer music caters to all tastes
Author: Robert J. Gramatges/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Summer is almost here and there are several albums that are sure to give your vacation an extra punch no matter where it is you go.

Whether you are fishing on a flats boat in the Keys or cruising to the Bahamas on a yacht, there are a couple of albums that are perfect tone-setters for any trip. 

The first is Meet Me In Margaritaville: The Ultimate Collection, the greatest hits of Jimmy Buffet. 

This album includes all of his best songs and creates an ideal laid-back summer mood for your nights in Margaritaville. 

If Jimmy Buffet is not in your repertoire, you may find the younger, fresher sounds of Jack Johnson's On and On appealing.  

His music is an acoustic brain massager that sounds as great in your headphones with a drink on the beach as it does on your small boat stereo in the middle of the sea. 

Those staying in the city this summer may find the soundtracks to summer blockbusters a safe bet. 

The 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack and The Matrix: Reloaded soundtrack have been sitting pretty in the top ten of the Billboard 200 this month, setting a nice pace for all soundtracks to come. 

After Pink's titillating MTV Movie Awards performance of "Feel Good Time" from the Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle soundtrack, the disc is sure to kill on the charts later this month. 

MTV viewers got a taste of Metallica in early May on "MTV Icon: Metallica." Their eighth studio album, St. Anger, hits stores on June 5. 

The very well put together two-disc set includes a fan-friendly bonus DVD and a sneak peak at their video game due out in two years.

Although rockers may have been waiting on the edges of their seats for new Metallica, this will not be the only megastar album release of the summer. 

Latin music will make another cameo in mainstream American pop in July with Thalia's English language debut. 

Her first single "I Want You" features Fat Joe, which is quite a change of pace for the Mexican artist and makes her debut something many look forward to hearing.

Another sexy siren to release an album this summer is Beyoncé Knowles. Her first solo effort without her girls from Destiny's Child, Dangerously in Love will prove if Beyoncé can hack it without the group. 

Of course it is a great help for her to have heavy hitter Jay-Z on her side for this one. An interesting side note: the song "Dangerously in Love" is actually a track from DC's Survivor. Hip Hop has been tearing through any competition on the charts this year with über-successful stars like 50 Cent, and the trend will most likely continue over the summer. 

50's Get Rich or Die Tryin' has been on top for almost 20 weeks now and shows no signs of losing ground in the next months.

 R. Kelly and Sean Paul show similar clout with albums in the Top 20 this month, proving that hip hop will dominate this season as it did the last.  

Sadly, the summer usually passes faster than any other season. However, the music you listen to over the summer will always bring back the best of memories, so be sure to make good choices at the record store.
