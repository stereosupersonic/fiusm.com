Headline: Bizfest offers students networking opportunity
Author: By Jacqueline Moreno, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The College of Business Administration student organizations held their first annual Bizfest last Thursday morning.  Organization leaders encouraged students to network through involvement in business and leadership clubs.  

"Companies are looking for students that are involved in extracurricular activities besides having good academics," AMA Co-President Joel Gandara said. 

The Business Student Leaders Council, which is comprised of the leaders of the CBA organizations, hosted the event.

Alpha Kappa Psi (a business fraternity), American Marketing Association, Financial Management Association, Student Government Association and FIU Accounting Association were among the organizations that had tables and banners set up behind the Ryder Business building.

 Students walking by were given reading material, applications, pens, candy and a sticker from each table they visited. Those who collected five or more stickers were given Imperial rice from Blue Sky Food By The Pound and soda.

"We have enough food to feed 300 people," Bill Levin, MBA student and Alpha Kappa Psi executive vice president, said. 

However, the turnout was not what the leaders of the council expected. 

Though Vanessa Rodriguez, AMA vice president of fundraising, said they "worked hard to get the word out by working closely with the Dean and by telling students about it in class," about two-thirds of the food was left over.

But the council remains optimistic about the future of Bizfest.

"We're hoping for one every semester," Levin said. 

Pablo Bravo, an accounting senior and council member said "the long term goal would be to have a Bizfest held every semester funded by CBA."

Levin said that because of his participation in student organizations he was able to get a job at the Center for Leadership Involvement. And added "it pays to get involved." 

One opportunity for hands-on experience is AMA's new project that promotes FIU sports. AMA members will have the opportunity to create a marketing plan and slogan for the football team, amongst other things.

 "Its like an internship," Rodriguez said.

In addition to the project, AMA will also continue to bring its members guest speakers every month, network meetings and socials.  

The Center for Leadership Development and Civic Responsibility, which is part of the Division of Student Affairs at FIU, offers students an opportunity to build their leadership skills.  The center has a program that aims to prepare students to become effective leaders who are civic minded, exhibit integrity and ethical behavior, and to become involved on campus and in the community.

"If a student goes to this program, potential employers will regard him or her as a good candidate for a position in their organization," Glenn Bowen, leadership facilitator and graduate social welfare student said.

The council encouraged students who did not attend Bizfest to log on the CBA website (http://cba.fiu.edu/portal/external/index.htm) to get more information on its organizations.

Headline: College of Education searches for 30 scholarship candidates
Author: By Felicidad Garcia, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The College of Education is currently seeking to award 30 students with full-tuition scholarships, plus a yearly stipend of $600, while they pursue a degree in Special Education. 

FIU Education Professor Marisal Gavilan and Connie Tuma, Educational and Training Program coordinator, are overseeing this scholarship program. This program is part of a five-year government fund to the school  through which the Department of Special Education will receive $200,000 a year for five years.

Students who are moving into their third year of course work at FIU and who are pursuing a degree in education are urged to consider the option of teaching children with disabilities whose first language might not be English. 

"Right now, the field of Special Education is changing dramatically, and unfortunately, it's not for the care of the kids but for financial reasons," Gavilan said.

Special Education is a field that encompasses teaching children with varying levels of mental retardation, behavioral disorders, and learning disabilities.  

The Department of Education's faculty has  recently been trained and certified to teach English for Speakers of Other Languages competency- infused courses. As a result, all education majors who graduate from FIU will have earned the bonus of an ESOL certified teaching degree. 

Gavilan said it can be a challenge to defend the educational rights of those who may not be mentally ill, but, because they are frequently being  misunderstood because of their limited English skills, are too hastily placed in Special Education classrooms. 

Transfer students are invited to apply for this program, however, all those selected must be prepared to begin taking courses in summer of 2003. In addition to full tuition for up to 12 credits and a $600 yearly stipend, scholarship recipients will also be granted the opportunity for paid travel in the United States. 

Gavilan will host interviews beginning Jan. 23. Once admitted to the scholarship program, students can expect to participate in a 2 1/2 year agenda that includes semester meetings and internships.  

The last semester before students graduate will be dedicated to an internship, which will require all participants to quit their jobs in order to fulfill their graduation requirements, Gavilan said.  To compensate for this the program will compensate students with a $3,500 stipend during their last semester of course work in addition to their tuition scholarships. 

"Florida has the highest unemployment rate among people with bachelors' degrees," noted Gavilan, emphasizing that "Special Education is the only program [in which] people will not find closed doors across the country."

"I think there's going to be a really good reaction because students are realizing the critical  shortage area that special education is and a lot of students are going  to be able to take advantage of that," Tuma said. "They not only get a free education but a guaranteed job, which in this world is really hard to find." 

Junior  Marisal Rodriguez  realized  the opportunity that this grant had to offer her being a para-professional, or teaching assistant as well as a mother and wife.

"I've been working as an assistant with Miami-Dade County schools, helping special children for 14 years and I think it's wonderful," Rodriguez said. "I love my kids. I wouldn't change it for anything in the world." 

Still, Rodriguez  understands that " not everybody  would like to do this,"  But she said "they really need a lot of people in this field. "

The Department of Special Education is making an effort to   entice people to help fill the void in the profession through additional undertakings.  These include granting scholarships to working para-professionals, or teachers' aides, so that they may earn bachelors' degrees in special education and providing scholarships for unemployed professionals with bachelors' degrees who might appreciate the opportunity to pursue a master's degree in special education. 

"My objective is to attract people who want to be teachers for students with disabilities, and who are interested in reaching these kids in their culture and in their language," Gavilan said.

&nbsp;
WEDNESDAY  -  Biscayne Bay Student Government President Adrian Carter filled three vacant executive government positions this week with the nomination of Chantelle Bean for Clerk of Council, Ralph Cadet for Director of Community Relations and Jordan Fishman for director of Technological Advancement. Each of the appointments was approved by a unanimous council vote.

New business presented included the publishing of a Who's Who directory that will recognize outstanding FIU students; the creation of a University Mentor Program that will pair freshmen students with junior and senior students upon their arrival to FIU; and the creation of a dental plan for international students. 

SGC is completing the reports for the student surveys conducted by the various council members during the fall semester. Upon completion, the reports will be presented to the administration.

Looking ahead, Carter said there would be tough decisions to be made this semester concerning next year's budget.

Carter emphasized the importance of looking at the needs for improvements to the facilities at the Biscayne Bay Campus. In particular "the bathrooms are in need of updating," he said. There will need to be cuts made to some of the programs now being funded to pay for facility improvements. There may be "fewer programs next year," he said, but they will be of  "better quality."

SGC will now begin meeting every other week. The next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday the 29th at 3:30 p.m.

Headline: Soccer's fate remains in jeopardy
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Shock, surprise, disbelief and disappointment were among the adjectives FIU athletes and coaches used to describe the past five days. The men's soccer program is in jeopardy of being dropped by FIU athletics due to financial considerations.

FIU announced the program's elimination Thursday. Twenty-four hours later, officials said they would reconsider.

A final decision could come as early as Tuesday, when administrators meet to decide the fate of the program.

The decision came down to eliminating men's soccer, or making budget cuts in each of the department's programs, FIU Athletic Director Rick Mello said.

"With cost increases in the areas of travel and tuition, we were faced with either eliminating the only sport not aligned with the Sun Belt Conference or reducing budgets in all of our sports, which would eventually erode the competitiveness of our program," Mello said.

Men's soccer accounts for approximately 4 percent, or $360,000, of the athletic department's $9.6 million budget.

The postponement of a final decision came after a day-long meeting between administrators and student-athletes. The players expressed concern over their ability to acquire a scholarship from another university at this late a date.

"In trying to do the right thing for our overall intercollegiate athletic program with regards to eliminating our men's soccer program; an unintended consequence of this action was how much it would negatively impact our student-athletes with regards to finding scholarships at other NCAA institutions," Mello said. "Because of this, I have spoken with President Dr. Mitch Maidique and he is allowing us to re-examine our previous decision to disband the program."

Head coach Karl Kremser is not setting any expectations.

"What kind of expectations can you have when you're told they are canceling the program, then the next day they are considering re-instating it?" Kremser said.

Sources within the university said the most probable plan would involve reinstating men's soccer for one year.

But an extra year is not enough for some players.

"I don't think that's good enough," defender Alejandro Sanchez said.

Sanchez, who has two years of eligibility left, said he expects to transfer before next season, even if FIU brings the program back for a year.

FIU will continue to fully fund the men's soccer players if they choose not to transfer.

"I met with them [Thursday night]," Kremser said. "They were shocked. I think they will look to transfer."

Sanchez, who did not attend the meeting, received the information from a teammate.

"I didn't want to believe it," he said. "They just left us out on our own."

The original decision to drop the team caught the players and their coach by surprise. Kremser learned of the decision five hours before the announcement.

"I received a call [at 7:45 a.m.] saying that Rick Mello wanted to see me in his office at 9:30 a.m.," Kremser said from his home on Thursday night.

"It's a little difficult for me to understand," he said. "I don't think the university is in any immediate threat of bankruptcy. It was a shock to me." 

The men's soccer program began play when the university opened in 1972. In the 31 seasons since, the program established itself as the most successful in school history, posting a 366-169-37 record and winning the NCAA Division II national championship in 1982. The program also reached the Division I national championship game in 1996.

Kremser, who has led the program for the past 22 years, expressed confusion as to why the men's soccer program is being considered for elimination.

"No athletic program anywhere, with the exception of the top-20 schools in the country, makes money," Kremser said. "Historically, the men's soccer program draws as well as anyone."

The team ranked second in attendance among fall sports, behind football, drawing 2,630 fans and averaging 263 per game. The men's and women's basketball and baseball teams draw higher numbers.

Administrators promised the coaches that there would be no program cuts after the university added football, Kremser said.

"In all our discussions before we added football, we were assured that no other programs were in jeopardy," Kremser said. "No one here is blaming football. We have a bright future with football. Don Strock is a great coach. But this makes no sense."

 Everyone in the department had fair warning, Mello said.

"It was being contemplated for quite some time. I made it very clear to my coaches," Mello said. "I indicated time and time again, that if we didn't start generating income, we would have to make some problematic cuts."

Neither football nor Title IX, a law requiring schools to give equal opportunity to male and female athletes, played a role in the decision, Mello said. Moreover, the money that funds the football program is separated from the rest of athletics.

"Football has its own funding source, from student fees and outside revenue," Mello said. "There has not been $1 siphoned out for football. This was not motivated by Title IX. If we were generating more outside revenue [this would not have occurred.]"

The elimination of the program comes after the team won the Atlantic Soccer Conference championship last fall and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

"The sad thing about this is that there are cycles as far as special teams go," Kremser said. "In 1972, we had a special team. In 1984, we had another special team. The sad thing is that we are right on the cusp of an outstanding team."

No further cuts are planned, but Mello is concerned about the future of athletics at a national level.

"I don't see dropping sports in the future. We're at the NCAA minimum right now," Mello said. "Down the road, there are always going to be issues. Eventually, if costs keep going up and if revenue keeps going down - What does common sense tell you? Unfortunately, the way the profession of college athletics has evolved, you have to make business decisions. It's just very sad that this had to happen."

Headline: Johnson, Harris gone
Author: Daisy Fernández/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Forward Taurance Johnson and guard Al Harris were removed from the men's basketball program Jan. 14. FIU will now compete without two of their top offensive players.

Johnson, a sophomore from Williamsport, PA., was suspended after the team's Dec. 18 game at DePaul.

"Taurance is eligible, but has academic obligations that require his total attention and focus," head coach Donnie Marsh said. "We regret that he will not be able to participate this season." 

"In addition, Taurance can fully rehab an injured ankle that hampered him during pre-season conditioning," Marsh said.  

As a freshman, Johnson was named honorable mention All-Sun Belt Conference and finished third in blocks and steals. He was the seventh-leading scorer in the conference for the 2001-02 season. 
As for this season, Johnson participated in two games and averaged five points and two rebounds. 

Harris, a junior from Miramar, Fla., was also dismissed from the team for violating unspecified rules of the program. 

In the 2002-03 season, the 6-foot-9-inch guard averaged 10.2 points per game and 5.5 rebounds. Before competing at FIU, Harris previously played at Seton Hall University.

"I wish Al well, but it is in the best interest of the program to move forward without him at this time," Marsh said.

The Golden Panthers currently stand at 6-11, 0-4 in conference play.
Phone calls to both Johnson and Harris were not returned.

Headline: Alimentos transgénicos, una verdad difícil de digerir
Subheadline: Milka Gizele Carrasquillo
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
A ojos cerrados, usted puede estar comiendo las frutas y los vegetales que tanto recomiendan los doctores y los nutricionistas para una dieta saludable. Pero, ¿hasta qué punto estas fuentes naturales de vitaminas y minerales le hacen bien a su salud?

Algunos de los alimentos que consume en su casa podrían contener componentes genéticos que no les corresponden naturalmente. Los llamados alimentos transgénicos o genéticamente modificados son mayormente frutas y vegetales a los que se les ha alterado su genética. Este es un proceso de transferencia de los componentes deseables de un organismo a otro organismo, por ejemplo, de un pez a un tomate o de un animal a una planta. 

Lo que se creó para producir sustancias de uso farmacéutico se utiliza hoy con propósitos comerciales. El objetivo inicial de la modificación genética fue crear resistencia a pesticidas o a insectos dañinos mediante la inserción de genes de un tipo especial de bacteria. De esta forma, el alimento expresa estos genes y produce proteínas especiales que lo protegen de insectos. 

Sin embargo, otros factores convenientes para los empresarios han aparecido. Con el proceso, los productos obtienen mayor vida comercial, ya que, además de la resistencia a insectos y pesticidas, soportan cualquier condición climatológica y ambiental. Las temperaturas extremas de calor o frío, las sequías y los distintos tipos de suelos dejaron de ser problemas para los agricultores.

Los experimentos han avanzado de tal forma que hasta el color, el olor y el tamaño pueden ser alterados por la modificación genética. Algunos de los alimentos que pueden estar siendo alterados son los tomates, las papas, el maíz, la calabaza, el café, el apio, las zanahorias, las uvas y la leche. 

De la zanahoria se conoce que se aplica la ingeniería genética para prolongar el caroteno crujiente a la hora de ser ingerido. En el café, la modificación genética se utiliza para reforzar el aroma y reducir la cafeína, mientras que en las papas se aplica para reducir su capacidad de absorber aceites durante la fritura y obtener variedades más dulces y grandes. Con las uvas se pretende conseguir nuevas variedades sin semillas.

Sin embargo, las posibles ventajas y los aún desconocidos peligros de estas alteraciones genéticas están causando controversia entre científicos, ecologistas y políticos.  De hecho, algunos expertos opinan que el exceso de ciertos nutrientes puede perjudicar la salud. Y esa es una de las mayores consecuencias de la modificación genética, lo que contribuye a que los nutrientes sean alergénicos, tóxicos y de menor valor.  Además, la creación de nuevos venenos y enfermedades, la resistencia de los insectos a los pesticidas y la inmunidad a los antibióticos que pueden crear algunos organismos son quejas frecuentes de los científicos que se oponen a toda modificación artificial.

Los ambientalistas, por otra parte, abogan por la virginidad de los ríos.  Por su modificación para la resistencia a los pesticidas, las plantas necesitan mayores concentraciones de los mismos. En consecuencia, se contaminan los embalses de agua.

El debate, más que científico y ambientalista, es uno político. Mientras Estados Unidos respalda la investigación y la producción de alimentos transgénicos, Europa propone cautela a la hora de la comercialización y el consumo. 

Mucho se dice acerca de los alimentos transgénicos: que pueden ayudar a desaparecer el hambre mundial, que la economía se beneficiaría y que con el mismo procedimiento se podrían desarrollar sustancias farmaceúticas. No obstante, hay quienes sostienen que estos alimentos pueden causar cáncer, que ya han originado muertes en algunos países, que el fenómeno de las vacas locas está asociado a estas modificaciones y hasta que se pueden liberar genes mutantes. 

Lo cierto es que muchos desconocemos los peligros de estas modificaciones genéticas. Mientras, seguimos comiendo ensaladas y degustando aromáticas tazas de café.

Headline: Constructora no responde a necesidades de Sweetwater
Subheadline: Erika Maldonado
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
La empresa Solo Construction no ha comenzado las obras de prevención de inundaciones que ganó en litigio a la ciudad de Sweetwater y cuya fecha estimada era el 7 de octubre de 2002.

Luego del proceso de licitación que se le otorgó en marzo, Solo Construction ha demorado el comienzo de las obras de la etapa I que debían ejecutarse a la brevedad. Esta etapa contempla la construcción de canales para encauzar el agua y la colocación de medidores y un sistema de bombeo del agua hacia el canal de la calle 8. Tiene una duración estimada de seis meses y se llevará a cabo a lo largo de la avenida 102 del S.W. entre las calles 3 y 8, donde se encuentra el canal. 

La ciudad recibió los fondos para las obras de construcción por disposición federal, a través de la Agencia Federal de Manejo de Emergencias, FEMA (por sus siglas en inglés). La decisión se tomó en el año 2000, luego de que el huracán Irene y "la tormenta sin nombre" dejaran a varias ciudades de la Florida bajo el agua. Estos fondos federales salieron del &#8220;reembolso de asistencia pública de $92.6 millones que han sido designados por costos de desastres, incluidas la remoción de escombros y servicios de emergencia, las horas extra de policías y trabajadores, así como las reparaciones permanentes de infraestructura&#8221;, según se lee en documentos de FEMA. 

A Sweetwater se le adjudicó un monto de $6.3 millones para ejecutar el plan. FEMA entrega este dinero en fases y tiene límites de tiempo que se deben cumplir, de lo contrario el dinero se asigna a otra causa.

En octubre, la ciudad emitió el permiso de comienzo de la obra y envió una carta de aviso a los residentes del área afectada. Solo Construction movilizó su maquinaria el 16 de octubre junto con materiales de construcción pero aún los trabajos no han comenzado. 

La constructora fue contactada en varias oportunidades para obtener su versión, pero no respondió. 

El especialista de la ciudad

Sweetwater contrató a la empresa Craig A. Smith y Asociados, CAS, para realizar el diseño y asesorar el proyecto de prevención de inundaciones. 

Esta empresa tiene como misión &#8220;la búsqueda de asistencia gubernamental en el sur de la Florida y brindar asistencia e ingeniería de calidad, planeamiento y servicios de topografía&#8221;, según se lee en su página de Internet. 

Posteriormente, se contrató a CAS para supervisar a las compañías que ejecutarán las distintas etapas del proyecto, con lo que CAS se convirtió en la empresa especialista que representa a la ciudad. 

Según Marie O. Schmidt, dependiente de la ciudad, el ingeniero de Sweetwater, Rudy Ibarra, trabaja conjuntamente con CAS. Él aprueba los permisos de trabajos públicos y toma las decisiones en nombre de la ciudad y frente a CAS.

&#8220;Nos han servido como asesores y lo han hecho efectivamente. Son muy profesionales y nos dan un resultado claro de las opciones y a qué podemos atenernos a la hora de decidirnos por una compañía o por un proyecto que estamos desarrollando&#8221;, agrega José M. Díaz, concejal de la ciudad.

Crónica de un problema anunciado

Por ley, la ciudad de Sweetwater debe abrir un proceso público de licitación para adjudicar cualquier trabajo. 

Solo Construction presentó el presupuesto más bajo de las tres opciones en la licitación de la etapa I del proyecto de prevención de inundaciones. 

&#8220;El problema comenzó cuando el alcalde le otorgó la etapa I del proyecto a otra compañía. Nos basamos no sólo en el precio sino en la trayectoria de la empresa. El precio puede ser un poquito alto pero si la compañía ha tenido récord de no completar trabajos o ha tenido problemas legales con otros trabajos que se le han presentado en otras ciudades, se decide por la compañía que menos problemas haya tenido. La decisión favoreció a una empresa con un presupuesto superior al presentado por Solo, pero con una historia de negocios libre de acciones judiciales y retrasos&#8221;, comenta Díaz.

Por su parte, Joe Jeffreis, gerente de Proyectos de CAS, asegura que la otra empresa elegida comenzó a hacer trabajo preliminar, tras presentar los planes para su aprobación. No obstante, añade Jeffreis, Solo Construction se presentó en corte y retó la habilidad de la ciudad para adjudicar contratos. 

&#8220;La corte decidió que el proyecto debería ser otorgado a Solo Construction  por presentar el presupuesto más bajo&#8221;, dice Jeffreis. 

Sweetwater apeló la decisión que fue &#8220;no a lugar&#8221; y la corte ordenó, además, que el proyecto lo realizara dicha constructora y prohibió adjudicarlo a otra empresa en el futuro. La ciudad aceptó y se firmó el contrato de construcción. 

&#8220;No tuvimos problemas en dárselo, pero siempre con miedo de que pudieran presentarse circunstancias similares por las cuales no les habíamos dado el trabajo. Y, efectivamente, ellos no comenzaron la obra en el tiempo que deberían y eso atrasa la llegada de los fondos y el dinero que otorga FEMA&#8221;, agrega Díaz. 

Luego de firmar el contrato comenzaron los problemas. Según Jeffreis, en ese momento Solo Construction aseguró que podía realizar el trabajo pero no en el tiempo estipulado. La ciudad esperaba que las obras se empezaran en mayo de 2002, pero por el proceso judicial se demoró hasta julio. 

No obstante, la constructora aseveró que no podía comenzar. Se le pidió que empezara en agosto y, tras otra negativa, la ciudad le dio una extensión para comenzar el 7 de octubre. 

El contrato establece un plazo de 180 días para terminar la obra. Solo Construction presentó un plan de trabajo que amplía el plazo de construcción a 283 días y luego a 360. El argumento que le presentó a CAS y a la ciudad fue que no contaba con el personal necesario para ejecutar la obra, pues tiene compromisos previos que cumplir.

&#8220;A mediados de octubre Solo Construction  movilizó su equipo. Todo está allí sin hacer nada. CAS nos informó que la empresa iba a taladrar en los días siguientes. Pero nada ocurrió. Luego el camión desapareció y vino otro camión. Eso es todo lo que han hecho&#8221;, afirma Schmidt.

Jeffreis añade: &#8220;No importa que el equipo esté en un lugar si no está trabajando. Es sólo para probar que ellos han movilizado y esta palabra tiene un peso importante. Significa el inicio del pago del contrato&#8221;.

Luego de la firma de un contrato cualquier compañía tiene de 30 a 60 días para entregar los documentos originales a partir de la fecha de otorgamiento. Solo Construction ha retrasado la entrega y ha presentado planos que la ciudad ha rechazado. En la opinión de Jeffreis esto es una &#8220;cortina de humo&#8221; para evitar el comienzo de la obra. 

&#8220;La compañía a la que le habíamos otorgado el proyecto nos dio su documentación y fue aprobada. Ellos podrían haber empezado a trabajar hace casi un año&#8221;, dice Jeffreis.

El futuro incierto

Las consecuencias del retraso afectan a la ciudad y principalmente a sus residentes por la incomodidad que implica un alargamiento en el plazo de las obras. 

José Suárez, vecino de la calle 4, comenta: &#8220;Es muy complicado entrar a casa por las máquinas y los tubos y las obras aún no empiezan. Quiero ver cómo hace esta gente para trabajar y darme acceso a mi casa. Además mis visitantes no tienen dónde estacionar, es muy incómodo&#8221;.

Marta de González se queja del polvo que esto va a traer a su casa y está preocupada por su nieta que padece de asma. 

&#8220;Yo sé que es por el bien de la ciudad, pero no entiendo por qué no empiezan de una vez, para salir rápido de esto&#8221;, dice González. 

Además, no todos los vecinos están de acuerdo con la obra. 

&#8220;He ido a las reuniones de la ciudad y no entiendo para qué hay que construir todo esto. Total, si llueve de manera constante como en la tormenta del 2000 ni estas obras ni nadie podrá evitar que nos entre agua a la casa&#8221;, dice Felipe Rojas, quien ha residido en el área por más de veinte años.

Schmidt vive enfrente de las obras. &#8220;Esto me afecta, pues ellos (los trabajadores de la constructora) tienen que darle acceso a la entrada de mi casa. Mi esposo se encuentra en silla de ruedas y no puede saltar las construcciones. Tendrán que hacer una rampa o plataforma para que él pueda salir de la casa y hacia la calle&#8221;, dice Schmidt.

Pero el problema es mucho más grave. Jeffreis explica que, según la ley, los propietarios de viviendas reconstruidas luego de una inundación están en la obligación de comunicar esta condición a sus posibles compradores. Si la casa pasa a otras manos y ocurre algún daño en la propiedad, el nuevo dueño puede demandar al propietario anterior por no avisarle. 

Esto hace que el valor real de las propiedades en Sweetwater se mantenga por debajo del valor del mercado, que sea difícil vender una propiedad y que los dueños incurran en faltas por desconocimiento de la ley. También existe el temor de que los fondos federales no sean adjudicados. 

&#8220;Puede ocurrir que FEMA le otorgue el dinero a otro proyecto si no se cumplen los plazos. El período para comenzar la obra desde el momento que se otorgó el dinero era de 18 meses que se cumplieron el 1 de octubre de 2002. FEMA nos dio una extensión pues había trabajo adelantado. A menos que algo pase el dinero puede irse&#8221;, dice Jeffreis, quien conversa con Solo Construction varias veces a la semana. 

&#8220;Hemos tenido reuniones, se les han enviado cartas certificadas, (los hemos contactado) por teléfono y correo electrónico y siguen aplazando la obra&#8221;, asegura.

Ante la imposibilidad de comenzar la obra, Solo Construction presentó una opción que contempla el contrato: subcontratar a otra empresa para realizar una parte de la etapa I. La ciudad debe aprobar a la empresa y su presupuesto, que es el doble de lo estipulado. 

&#8220;Podemos decir que esa empresa no es recomendable, pero Solo Construction puede ir a corte por eso también pues todo está sujeto a revisión. En el contrato hay una cláusula que nos permitiría tomar esa parte del proyecto y dárselo a otra compañía si Solo Construction tomara esa acción. Pero esto representa mucho trabajo y pone a la ciudad en mala posición, puede ser causa para otro litigio y la ciudad no quiere eso, lo que quiere es que el trabajo se haga&#8221;, afirma Jeffreis.

El panorama no es sencillo para Sweetwater. En el mejor de los casos, Solo Construction  comenzará la obra y la terminará en un plazo razonable. En el peor de los casos, la ciudad se verá en la posición de demandar a la empresa. 

Michael G. Lavin, director financiero de Sweetwater, dice que se le pagó al abogado Ramón Irizarri para defender a la ciudad, pero él es un abogado general. La comisión le ha dado potestad para contratar los servicios de un abogado especialista en litigios de este tipo en caso de ser necesario. Sin embargo, la ciudad no tiene dinero para otra demanda legal contra la constructora.

&#8220;La ciudad tiene una buena posición para demandar por daños, pero quién sabe cuál será la respuesta. Sweetwater pensó que tenía una buena posición cuando fue a corte por primera vez contra Solo Construction y perdió. Si no se termina el trabajo o se termina pero no de la manera esperada, el seguro de la ciudad tiene una cláusula que permite concluir el trabajo&#8221;, dice Jeffreis. 

Esto excluye la decisión de la corte de que Solo Construction tiene exclusividad en el contrato. Entonces la aseguradora tomaría el control y decidiría a quién contratar. En otro escenario más sencillo, la corte podría solicitar a la ciudad sugerencias de compañías. 

&#8220;Desde el principio, con Solo Construction nada ha sido sencillo. Estoy seguro de que vamos a ver acción legal antes de que esto ocurra&#8221;, dice Jeffreis.

Éste es tan sólo un capítulo del dilema para prevenir las inundaciones en la ciudad. Aún quedan cinco etapas más que realizar. FEMA otorgó $6.3 millones que alcanzarán para realizar tan sólo las etapas I y III. 

&#8220;Tenemos cuatro etapas más y no hay dinero. Debemos sacar ese dinero de otro lado. Si la etapa I cuesta más de lo esperado, eso le quita dinero a la etapa III. Esto es un problema muy complejo&#8221;, concluye Jeffreis.

Headline: Injustice 
Subheadline:

January 24, 2003



To Whom It May Concern:


     How would you like to work for three years and not get a raise?  How about not being able to take your required 15 minute break? How about being at a certain pay scale and making less than those hired after you? And how would it be if you worked in a food service company and were not allowed to drink or even purchase coffee from the same place you work at?  You probably think this goes on in countries like Cuba or North Korea.  In reality you don't have to look too far. Cafeteria employees at FIU are living these injustices and many more like then everyday at FIU. 

It is shameful to even imagine that Aramark Corporation, which handles the food service at FIU, would do this to people who earn minimum wage salaries.  I suggest that it is in your journalistic interest to look into this matter so that FIU officials and the public learn of such wrongdoings.  It is no coincidence that the majority of the food service providers are Spanish speaking immigrants who work very hard but are readily taken advantage of.  It could only be assumed that many swallow such injustices because they fear their bosses retaliating against them.  But, we must assure them that they are not in a communist state. That in America, we tackle injustices head on. That they, like every immigrant before them, deserves to be treated fairly and  without the fear of retaliation.

So, next time you have your "Pollo Tropical" or your buffet style lunch, think about those serving you.  Think about how they are being treated.  Think that they could've been you (had you not been born here), or your parents or grandparents many years ago.  It's time for you to make a small difference in people's lives.


Sincerely,


A friend of the Food Service Workers.

Dear Editor:

I graduated last July with a Masters in Latin American and Caribbean Studies.  

Much to my surprise, when my diploma was mailed to me in South Carolina where I now reside, the diploma read, "Latin American Studies."  After three hard years at FIU, I would like for my diploma to reflect the course of study that I followed.

I talked with other alumni of the program and several have had the same problem, even students from the Caribbean who did their research there.  Most have decided to just accept them the way they were written.

Don't leave out the Caribbean!  I was told that I should mail my diploma back and wait for a new one.  Being familiar with the bureaucracy at FIU, who knows when I would receive a corrected diploma.  All my attempts to solve my problem have resulted in "passing the buck."  Can anyone at the University reissue us accurate diplomas?

Headline: Life isn't all bad, is it? Well...
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
It's a wonderful life, and I know that, somewhere out there, the rotting corpse of Frank Capra is grinning happily.

You see, last week I wrote this calamitously desperate column in which I proposed to end the drudgery of my everyday existence by repeatedly running into a brick wall unless my dear readers decided to send a dollar each. 

This is exactly the kind of unethical blackmail you should expect from a writer without principles.

But that was last week. Now, the miracle of human kindness has opened my eyes, and I know what my life is worth. 

That would be exactly $6.25, by the way. 

This amazing sum was sent by compassionate people from all over the world, including Hialeah. I was incredibly moved to say the least. 

I see things in a different way now. The world is bursting with love. 

To miss out on the beauty of it all would be a slap on the bearded face of our Creator.

There's so much to live for. The majestic sound of garbage trucks bellowing to each other right before dawn. 

The feel of sunshine on your shoulders, at least before the skin cancer settles in. 

The indescribable taste of a 39-cent cheeseburger. The smell of said cheeseburger on your lover's breath. 

The poignant sight of children hacking into computers and playfully erasing your entire financial history while they download the latest Eminem song before Eminem actually gets around to writing it.

There's music, of course. Kelly Clarkson, who has inspired me so much by her dizzying rise to fame and who will be remembered for centuries to come as the ultimate "American Idol." Kelly Osbourne, whose unbridled talent reminds us once and again that a little a fat girl can make it on her own, as long as she doesn't actually have to make it on her own. R. Kelly and Pete Townshend, who remind me that love has no age.

There's painting, the ultimate attempt to capture the beauty, and the triumph of the human spirit within a physical frame. Some of my life's fondest moments revolve around the almost religious experience of watching Dennis the Menace toil on, with his chin up. Art knows no more triumphant image than that of this valiant child armed only with his slingshot, eternally facing the whims of fate, like a modern David.

There's literature, the consolation and depiction of all our wildest dreams and passions. No one can claim to have lived a full life until they've experienced the dizzying whirlwind of emotions that is Nora Roberts' "Three Sisters Island" trilogy, surely one of civilization's greatest accomplishments. Naturally, there's Michael Crichton's "The Lost World," the most powerfully original novel about dinosaurs since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World." There's Anne Rice's "Vittorio the Vampire," the riveting masterpiece that is, without a doubt, the most penetratingly perceptive depiction of the human psycho-sexual mythos.

And, of course, there's the cinema, the 12th art. There are so many moments that I've shared with the big screen, lost in that maternal darkness that cradles our most secret dreams in its popcorn-scented womb. There's the warmth that fills my heart whenever any "Saturday Night Live" alumni contributes to the cinematic canon. There's the thrill of rediscovery that I've experienced with every movie that stars D.J. Qualls, the greatest comic of our time, whose unassuming frame houses the whole range of human emotion. I don't even need to talk about Vin Diesel, whose wit and forceful presence are the pinnacle of all that is pure and elevated in the human form. The same can be said about the graceful Heather Graham, who might well be the greatest actress of our age, thanks to her amazing ability to remain true to her nature throughout any acting role. 

All these simple joys are yours for free, or, at the very least, for a moderate price. I have to go on, then; I must go on. After all, I now have $6.25. The world is my oyster.

Headline: Life comes full circle for senior
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Because this is my final semester at FIU, I've been doing a lot of thinking about exactly where these four years of higher-education have left me. 

College is really nothing more than a rite of passage for many people. It's a "betweener" thing we have to go through before adulthood and after high school. A long time ago, high school was the big rite of passage: get that diploma, you're a man or woman. College was the equivalent of a bonus round. 

These days, it's all about college as a requirement. Very few people  don't consider going to college; it has become a given; "Now leaving high school. Next stop, college."

I'm looking at it closely now and I realize that outside of a few facts and figures and such, my time in class at FIU has netted me very little in terms of things I'm going to take with me into the real world. 

It's kind of funny too because I've gone full circle in my education. I'm right back to where I started: square one. Even my very first teacher at FIU is going to be my very last teacher, Professor McKinley. 

But I really feel like I've received very, very little in terms of advancement.

Not to say that I haven't learned. Despite my constant criticism of this university, I do feel that the school has some excellent professors in their respective fields and for that I'm grateful. 

The material they teach is interesting and profound and highly intellectual stuff, but unless I wind up on "Jeopardy!," it is very useless. 

But at the same time, I've learned so much during these four years that has nothing to do with the Saxons, Virginia Woolf or mitosis.

For example, I had my first serious long-term relationship, one that lasted almost three great years. I learned a lot when I found myself in the "boyfriend" scenario like that, in addition to plenty about how relationships work and don't work. 

I also learned that, unlike the majority of the sitcom/movie set-ups you see where all relationships end poorly, you can have a completely mutual break-up and wind up best friends with your ex. 

Now I've moved on to my second serious relationship and I don't think I would have been ready for it without the first one. 

My entire career focus has changed since I entered FIU. I came in wanting to be a journalist; that's why I'm on the newspaper staff. I was an editor for three years in high school and now I've wracked up close to four here at The Beacon. 

I was even preparing to be a journalism major. But then, an issue of Entertainment Weekly recommended an online game where you write movie scripts, and suddenly, my brain shifted to a new mode. No longer did I want to be a movie critic, stuck to merely analyzing others' work. I wanted to be a filmmaker. And that's where I stand today. I got a major in English and I'm planning to continue my education in film. 

I've also grown as a human being. When I was graduating high school, I specifically avoided going to any schools far away from my house. Why? I wasn't ready to leave home yet. I wasn't mature enough to move out and be on my own. 

Today, I'm actually anticipating that next step. Sure, it's a bit frightening of a concept, but I know I can handle it. I'm ready to move out. I'm an adult.

When you get down to it, four years ago, I was a senior, finishing up my final classes and trying to prepare myself for the next stage of life. 

It was time for me to mature, grow up, take some responsibilities and become an adult, and it terrified me in ways I never thought possible. I just wanted to lock myself in my room and shield myself from all of that: bills, taxes, insurance, and worse of all, work.

Now, four years later, things really have come full circle.

Headline: N. Korean nuclear reactor must go
Author: By Zev Chafets/ Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Until a few weeks, ago I didn't even know the name of the capital of North Korea. I want to say this right up front, so nobody takes me for an expert. 

Because, when it comes to North Korea, the experts clearly don't know what they're talking about.

In 1994, the experts in the Clinton administration made this deal: North Korea shuts down its nuclear weapons program in return for U.S. help in building a nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes.

In October, the North Koreans shocked the experts by admitting they were still secretly trying to make nuclear weapons. 

Next, they kicked International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors out of their Yongbyon nuclear facility. Within six months, Yongbyon can probably produce six nukes.

The experts blamed this development on President Bush. He had driven the North Koreans to desperate measures by including them in his axis of evil.

Then the experts found out - because the North Koreans told them - that they had been cheating on the deal since it was made, roughly six years before Bush's election.

OK, said the experts, what's done is done. What matters now is the future. They advocated immediate negotiations to get North Korea to agree to what it had agreed to, following negotiations, in 1994.

Bush didn't get it. Why should the United States pay twice for the same merchandise? And what made anyone think the North Koreans would honor their word this time?

A great chorus of expert denunciation greeted this unsophisticated, Texas cowboy approach. The North Koreans got themselves caught out on a limb, said the experts. Talks are the ladder that will allow them to climb down from the tree.

So Bush did what he often does with expert advice - he tried it. OK, he said, to the North Koreans, let's talk.

And North Korea said: No thanks. Instead, it said it was pulling out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 

No nation in history has ever done that.

This announcement came Friday. On Saturday, North Korea added that it will begin testing long-range missiles - giving the experts just 24 hours before the Sunday talk shows to concoct a new formula for making reality conform with theory. 

Doubtless it will call for a mixture of diplomatic discussions and American concessions. 

Meanwhile, North Korea, if it isn't stopped, will build a lot of atomic bombs very soon. 

It will sell these bombs to Iraq, Iran, al-Qaeda, the Russian mafia, the Colombian drug cartel and anyone else with a few million bucks and a grudge. Why would North Korea do that? Because it is broke and has nothing else to sell; and because, in Bush's words, it is an evil regime.

So, what should America do? Here are the choices: (1) ignore the whole thing and hope it goes away; (2) cut another deal, knowing in advance that it's worthless; (3) disarm North Korea, in line with the doctrine of pre-emption.

The thought of force makes the experts shudder. North Korea has a million-man army on the South Korean border. It has artillery aimed at downtown Seoul. There will be bloodshed. Economic disruption. Diplomatic outrage. Unilateral military action is unthinkable.

This leads directly back to options No. 1 and No. 2: wishful thinking.

The alternative is very straightforward. Give North Korea an ultimatum to dismantle the reactor. If it refuses, the United States should do what Israel did in Iraq in 1981 - destroy the enemy's nuclear reactor. 

And, as the world's sole superpower, the United States can do two things Israel couldn't: Warn North Korea that a military response will bring about a calamitous reaction, and second, inform the government in - what's the name of the capital again? - that it will never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.

Of course I'm no expert. But then again, thankfully, neither is Bush.

Affirmative action should be eliminated

To the editor:

In The Beacon's Jan. 8 issue,  the article "Affirmative Action still necessary" introduces us to class envy and discrimination.
Affirmative Action is not needed. Equality is what is needed. It is disgusting and ridiculous today for Affirmative Action to still be in existence. 
The discrimination that people face today is the "minority" label from liberals who are trying to create victims in society. 
Being Jewish myself, it disgusts me that success is recognized by where I came from and not what I have achieved. 
"After studying student achievement for nearly three decades," the author, Jim Mitchell, asserts that many black students are hindered by a culturally reinforced proclivity to underachieve academically for fear of being seen as "acting white."
This statement is an example of what is called an inferiority complex - not a rationale for affirmative action - or the special treatment of individuals who come from a "minority" group.
One comment that Mitchell  made is actually true: "Grubman's episode also proves that we don't live in a pure meritocracy where performance is all that counts."
We live in a society that speaks out of both sides of its mouth. 
On the one hand we have a university that says it is equal opportunity and on the other hand, says it is an "Affirmative Action institution." 
These are total opposites. 
Equal opportunity means you will not ask me what my cultural background is on the admissions application. 
Affirmative Action means you will accept my application if it looks like too many individuals from a certain cultural background have been accepted. 
Affirmative Action is pure discrimination and a ploy by liberals in this nation. 
It is a lie to say you are for equality but still recognize individuals based on where they come from rather than their achievements.

Football kills soccer

Dear Editor:

I am disappointed by the university's decision to cut the men's soccer program, but not surprised. 
As a graduate of the Miami-Dade School System, I'm familiar with the Florida Department of Education's warped view that football is the mechanism that will maximize the state's assets, thereby enabling the state to provide all Floridians with a high quality education.
The theory is that football is a panacea that can build a sense of community among a diverse student body through attendance at football games. 
My experience in high school and college has been that students derive a sense of community by participating in (as opposed to being spectators of) sports, student organizations and other extracurricular activities. 
Football requires a lot of resources and is maintained at the expense of diversity in the range of sports and other student activities offered at the high school and college level. 
As evidenced by the destruction of the soccer team's 31 seasons of history, football doesn't generate a sense of community, but rather destroys it.
It is also believed that footballhelps the school system achieve fiscal health by generating tremendous wealth through the sale of t-shirts, foam fingers, flags, key chains and numerous other trinkets with the football team's logo on it. 
The fact is that if revenue is created, it goes right back into the football program. 
I would strongly disagree with FIU athletic director Rick Mello's statement that football is worth the investment. 
The university might have seen revenue generated from the sale of tickets this season, but I doubt the income earned would even come close to the amount the university has spent on creating the football program. 
Who doesn't go to an athletic event hoping they might appear on television? When it comes to finding an internship or job after graduation, however, an employer won't make a hiring decision based on whether your school's football team had a winning or losing season. 
In short, a football program might bring notoriety, but not prestige.
The university wants to use football (not intercollegiate athletics) to enhance campus life and bring back alumni. News flash: Football hasn't enhanced my student life at FIU, and it won't bring me back to campus when I graduate.

Headline: Lack of foresight will have negative future effects on men's soccer
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The men's soccer program is FIU's winningest in the insitution's history, posting a 366-169-37 record in its 31 seasons of play.  It won a Division II national title and competed for a Divison I title. But this past Thursday, if only briefly, the program appeared to have met its demise.

FIU decided to cut the program due to financial considerations.  The decision was, however, rescinded only 24 hours later.

Why? According to Athletic Director Rick Mello, the decision had been made without considering the impact that it would have on the team's student-athletes and their ability to secure a scholarship at another institution.  

While much can be said about the decision itself, the fact that it was made without having considered its student-athletes is expecially disconcerting and casts a dubious shadow on FIU athletics.  

When a player takes a scholarship, he makes a commitment to that institution.  But it is incumbent that the university make a commitment to the welfare  of its players.

In it's decision, or rather indecision, FIU has violated that trust.

So what future is left for the soccer program? An official decision may be in as early as today.  But whether administrators decide to keep the program or not, it is ultimately doomed.

If the program were to stay, what prospective players can FIU hope to woo when its committment to the program has obviously waned? What chance does this program, which has produced 35 professional athletes, have of ever being competitive without those recruits?

Prospective student-athletes will now be disinclined to play for an institution that has showed an obvious disregard for its players' futures.  

Whether that impending decison reverses the program's dissolution, administrators have already, through their lack of foresight and their admitted lack of consideration, dealt a heavy blow to the future of the program.

It is my understanding that no one is entitled to the perfect marriage; every couple is expected to have a substantial amount of both ups and downs. Of course, when the couple in question consists of the pot-smoking doofus from "Dude, Where's My Car" and one of the gals from "Clueless," then the marriage has no where to go but down. It would be a somewhat tragic tale except that it's just the sort of plot that director Shawn Levy ("Big Fat Liar") can use to produce a half-decent romantic-comedy. The movie's humorous content consists mainly of immature slapstick comedy but still manages to work out very well, much like in a Jim Carrey film. 

Ashton Kutcher is Tom Leezak, a low-income, blue-collar worker who listens to the California traffic report on the radio at two in the morning. The ubiquitous Brittany Murphy is Sarah McNerney, a free-spirited aspiring writer who just happens to be a Beverly Hills heiress in a very wealthy family. Regardless of the enormous gap between their given social statuses, these two individuals were simply made for each other. You can tell from the beginning that it's love at first sight, which is weird because their initial meeting involves Sarah getting hit in the face by Tom's football. 

Fortunately, they both possess the annoying habit of laughing at every idiotic thing they see and hear, reminiscent of Beavis and Butt-Head. Upon such a foundation, they build a relationship, and in just 10 months, the couple announces their engagement. That's not moving too fast, right? As expected, many object to this union, and by many I mean Sarah's family, especially her father (David Rasche). I guess I can't blame him. If I were as wealthy and stuck-up as any of them were, I probably wouldn't want my daughter marrying below her status either. 

Everyone's objections are duly noted and eagerly discarded. The wedding goes off without a hitch and then it's on to the honeymoon. Remember those "downs" I mentioned earlier? This is where it all starts to unravel, in spades. Much like "National Lampoon's European Vacation," Tom and Sarah's European honeymoon shapes out to be equally enjoyable, and just as memorable. In other words, enjoyment was scarce and everybody wanted to forget the whole thing ever happened. France was a fiasco primarily due to Tom's stubborn jackass behavior, poor communication skills and lousy car selection. Italy was even worse: the magic is gone and continuous fighting takes its place.

Funny as the film was, I still think the jokes could have used a little more work. I found many of them to be pretty lame. Not to worry; those who don't find it funny will still find it romantic. While I personally don't believe the actual love story between Tom and Sarah is altogether plausible, I do believe it represents the truth about most relationships to some degree. Kutcher's performance when he was sweet-talking Murphy was very heartwarming. I was a bit surprised because I'm just so used to seeing him in "doofus" roles. Both he and Murphy give wonderful performances, as do the rest of the cast. Even if "Just Married" doesn't tickle your funny bone, it will almost certainly touch your heart.

Headline: Pulitzer-winning writer lectures on museums
Author: Isis Iglesias
&nbsp;
It was a chilly evening when Oscar Hijuelos came to town.  He probably brought the cold down with him when he traveled from New York to Miami to give a lecture at FIU.  Hijuelos was the guest speaker at the Dorothea and Steven Green Critics Lecture series regularly given at the university. 

He is an esteemed writer best known for his Pulitzer Prize winning novel, "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love." He was the first Hispanic to win the prestigious award. 

Even though he has written many other books such as: "Simple Habana Melody," "Mr. Ives' Christmas" and "Empress of the Splendid Season," Oscar Hijuelos' most famous work is still his first, probably because it was made into a successful movie.

Hijuelos opened his speech by giving the audience a major scoop: His beloved novel "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love" is going to soon debut on Broadway as a musical. The listeners in the audience were delighted by this news.

 The title of his lecture was "Art As Seen Through the Filter of Class," a topic the writer felt very strongly about.  

He spoke of his upbringing in the Upper West Side of New York City and how despite living in a great cultural center, his childhood suffered from a severe lack of art.  

His parents were working class Cuban immigrants who had very little time for such lofty pursuits. To Hijuelos, the art world was one that was vastly removed from his early life by more than a physical distance.

He lived a short bus ride away from many artistic institutions but still felt that, "it was as if these things existed in another universe."

While reminiscing about his neighborhood and the characters who inhabited it, he also noted a false perception the working class often has that they are not welcome at museums and galleries and how many of them felt a prejudice against people who had more education and money than they did. 

The impediment of access to art was an issue that he explored fully from both angles; that of the privileged and underprivileged.

He summarized his personal experience by saying, "That I had never gone to an art museum is not a mystery to me. However unfortunate, that kind of activity was simply not within the frame of reference of my community."

His life and view of the art world has much changed with time, education and wealth. He is now a collector and avid museum visitor.  

He gave a top five list of his favorite museums around the world and contrasted those rich experiences with his sparse ignorant encounters with art as something that some strange person was peddling on a street corner.

Hijuelos also explained that his early life had a deep impact on his perceptions of the world and revealed that, "The feeling of second class-ness that can accompany a person's life, this feeling inhibits passage through the world, limits imagination and reduces one's capacity for even the most simple of aesthetic pleasures, like looking at a beautiful painting. I know this because I have always felt it and still do, whatever my accomplishments."  

 He went on to express that his lack of early encounters with art culture affected him in other irrevocable ways, most notably in his taste in art. 

His disdain of modern art was apologetically revealed and he said, "I am too much of a primitive to truly appreciate modern art, although I aspire to it; that is to understand it, to appreciate it...but I fail again and again. What is the point of it? Dissected cows, exploding canvases, draped hillsides, what does it mean? I haven't got the faintest idea." 

 He expressed his heartfelt desire when he said, "I would like to see art appreciated by everyone. I'd like to see it cut across social barriers to all kinds of groups, or minorities if you like, so that even the most disadvantaged and ill-educated of people feel they are deserving of access to it."

Headline: FIU alumnus chronicles Mariel boatlift
Author: Isis Iglesias
&nbsp;
The opening night of the second  Made in Miami Film Festival was Jan. 10. Organized by Miami-Dade Community College, the festival is an overview of all that is a part of the film industry in Miami. 

It was a special evening for Miami, FIU and an extraordinary father and son. Of the dozens of films shown at the festival, the one that truly stood out was the opening night's film, "Mas alla del mar" ('Beyond the Sea.") FIU's own Lisandro Perez, professor of sociology and director of the Cuban Research Institute, produced the documentary. 

His son, Lisandro Perez-Rey, who is an FIU alumnus, directed it. "Mas alla del mar" is his first long feature film. 

The collaboration began when Perez-Rey, a filmmaker, wanted to make use of his father's extensive research on Cuba to help him better portray the subject matter that he wanted to explore in the film.

 In the Mariel boat lift, Perez-Rey found an issue that he felt was worth exploring in-depth. "I got interested in doing something on Mariel after seeing, hearing and reading a lot of the coverage during the 20th anniversary of the event in 2000," he said.

A filmmaker who picked up his first camera when he was 10 years old, Perez-Rey is in large part a self-taught film editor and cinematographer. 

He graduated from FIU in 1997 with a degree in anthropology. He said that he also studied visual arts while at FIU, where he gained a good understanding of the film medium, particularly from Professors Bill Maguire and Manuel Torres. 

After graduating, Perez-Rey has worked as a writer and television producer for such operations as the now defunct local station, WAMI. He is currently producing for the Spanish language station SKY-TV Latin America. 

For Perez-Rey, working on "Mas alla del mar" was a part-time project to which all his spare time was devoted. It took him about a year and a half of work to compile and edit all the interview footage for the film. 

The documentary tells the individual stories of a wide cross section of  "Marielitos." Perez-Rey spoke to hundreds of those who immigrated during the period and from those interviews, culled the most interesting subjects. His storytellers include a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, a Santera from Hialeah, a death row inmate and a transsexual entertainer, among others. 

He skips around between each interview weaving a visual, oral, and chronological account of a singular migration. 

"I realized that Mariel was quite possibly the most surreal, most tragic and most critical moment in the ongoing drama that is the history of Cuban immigration," Perez-Rey said.

The subject matter was not an easy one to capture. It encompasses a migration that took place over a few weeks and involved over 130,000 Cubans fleeing the island. 

Still, Perez-Rey manages to reveal the moment fully by using historical images, as well as footage from modern day Cuba.  

As an American citizen of Cuban descent, he felt it was an important event that needed validation as the major movement of its time. 

"One thing about Mariel is that it is a shameful and tragic historical moment, but basically those are the moments that we need to re-examine and learn from, so we can get on with the business of reconciliation between the Cubans in Cuba, Cuban exiles and the United States," he said.

Opening night, for both the film festival and "Mas alla del mar," was sold out. The showing was such a hit on Calle Ocho that we can only hope it can be widely distributed and released on video someday. 

 "I was surprised by the reactions of the viewers.  They laughed, they cried; it was amazing," Perez-Rey said. Even the event organizers did not expect such a large turn out for a historical documentary. 

The film is a work of art that sheds light and understanding on a memory that was perhaps too painful for some to reflect upon before that day. It was also a moment of triumph for a father, a University, and an entire community.

Headline: Chagall exhibit celebrates Jewish tradition
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
When millions of people pass by the United Nations Building in New York City, do you know what they see through a gargantuan glass window? Or what about when they pass the fresco better known as "Four Seasons," which can be found in First Bank in Chicago?  What they see are masterpieces created by painter Marc Chagall. On Jan. 12, FIU hosted the Dora Teitelboim Center for Yiddish Culture's retrospective of Chagall's work. 

Walking into WUC-100  on the Biscayne Bay Campus, spectators were first greeted by several of Chagall's works hanging on the walls. Although it wasn't a large exhibition, the Center's presentation of Chagall was professional and displayed in good taste. Approximately 60 viewers were present to see the exhibit and the hour-long documentary, "Homage to Chagall." The documentary was informative and educational, integrating narration and an interview with Chagall and his wife, Valerie.

Born in 1887 in a Russian village, Chagall was a soft-spoken, poetic, yet humorous man who was raised by Jewish parents and who felt a strong connection to their culture. Influenced greatly by his mother's love, support and traditions, Chagall was motivated to become successful in order to make her proud of his accomplishments. 

Chagall began to paint Biblical themes at a young age because he saw the Bible as the greatest source of inspiration. As a result, he linked the cosmic idea: man and universe unified. He saw Judaism and its culture as a compilation of color and he looked nowhere else when it came time to set the paintbrush to the canvas. 

At just 20 years old, Chagall painted his first self-portrait. Ever since, he has been referred to as the "greatest image-maker of the 20th century." 

In the featured documentary, the narrator leads us through Chagall's life and it becomes apparent that his experiences and emotions were expressed through his paintbrush. In his marriage to his first wife Bella, his fairy tale existence with her is reflected on the canvas. Chagall and Bella lived in France for most of their marriage.

During Chagall and Bella's marriage, he used many bright colors in his paintings, an obvious symbol that love shines from his eyes and heart straight into the eyes and heart of his viewers. It is said that he never finished a painting without asking for Bella's input. When she died in 1944, devastation struck him as it did his paintings, which at once became dark and gloomy. 

In 1952, Chagall re-married a woman named Valerie who attempts to translate his French dialogue during his interview. Once again, with the Bible as his guide, his paintings become vibrant and robust with a variety of hues. 

In the documentary, he explains that the Bible is the highest form of poetry. Even during a phase when he painted acrobats and clowns he did not stray from utilizing a biblical undertone on the canvas. 

Whether he was painting two stained glass windows of the Twelve Tribes in an Orthodox Synagogue in Jerusalem or tapestries entitled "Isaiah in Parliament," Chagall remained close to the beliefs of his Hasidic ancestry: anything natural can be made holy. When asked to describe his image of God, he replies, "God is love." 

But it isn't only through his words that Chagall exudes love, it is also through his demeanor. He comes across as a pleasant man who is completely down to earth.  

While watching the documentary, however, something disturbed me. One unidentified painting struck me as strange. It was an image of Moses with horns. It is disconcerting to me that as a Jew himself, Chagall would feed into the tradition of depicting Jews as horned creatures in old paintings according to ancient myths. 

Nonetheless, it is my responsibility as a spectator of Marc Chagall's work to spread his wish for mankind: "Look for love. Only love interests me."

Headline: La seducción del poder
Subheadline: David A. Meléndez
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Muchos críticos han tratado de encasillar a Sergio Ramírez como un novelista político. Sin embargo, este escritor nicaragüense se defiende de aquellos que no creen en su polivalencia literaria y le auguran un posible retorno a la política.

&#8220;Ni soy político profesional ni soy un novelista político ni voy a volver a la política&#8221;, sostiene Ramírez, durante una entrevista realizada en Miami, con motivo de su visita a la Feria Internacional del libro. &#8220;Mi deseo es explorar muchos más temas, para romper un poco con esa idea&#8221;, aclara. Lo que sucede es que muchos aún no se han acostumbrado a que este hombre ya no es un político, sino un escritor.              

Como tantos de ellos en su generación, Ramírez postergó su vocación literaria y se precipitó en los encantos revolucionarios. Pero a diferencia de otros colegas que murieron en la lucha, él llegó a la cúpula, ejerció la vicepresidencia de Nicaragua y fue el rostro intelectual y más amable del sandinismo, desde 1979 hasta 1990. Antes de despedirse de sus &#8220;muchachos&#8221; y de la revolución, intentó una renovación política de la izquierda y fracasó estrepitosamente en una candidatura presidencial. Desde entonces,  con la  voluntad de no regresar al poder, se dedica a escribir.

&#8220;El poder secreta un veneno llamado el autoengaño, que ciega a los poderosos y les ayuda a querer mantenerse arriba&#8221;, explica Ramírez.  &#8220;A mí lo que me seduce es el poder y su relación con los seres humanos&#8221;, afirma.

Ramírez ve el poder como una pasión y lo describe como &#8220;un entramado de ambiciones y dominios que se organizan a pesar de los seres humanos&#8221;.  Sin duda, la experiencia de haber estado arriba le ha proporcionado una ventaja: almacenar con claridad muchos datos en su cabeza. Pero no todo ha sido luces.

&#8220;Quise hacer un enjuiciamiento como escritor de esa etapa de mi vida, lejos de los reflectores de la revolución&#8221;, afirma Ramírez. &#8220;Me ha costado muchísimo caminar por mí mismo como escritor&#8221;, confiesa el novelista, añadiendo que lo más difícil es &#8220;dexintoxicarse de ese veneno&#8221;. 

Ramírez confiesa que realmente no tiene nada que ocultar, aunque haya titulado &#8220;Sombras nada más&#8221; a su más reciente novela.  

&#8220;El título se refiere a la canción de Javier Solís, (&#8220;Sombras nada más&#8221;) sobre la juventud de los personajes y de la mía propia&#8221;, aclara. &#8220;La historia se mueve entre las sombras del poder&#8221;. Para Ramírez,  las sombras son circunstancias, en las que se llevan a cabo muchas acciones de poder, &#8220;bajo las luces públicas&#8221;. 

De este modo, cualquiera puede imaginarse la gran cantidad de historias que le quedan por contar. &#8220;Siento que mi carrera tiene todavía muchísimos pasos que dar y cada paso es un libro&#8221;, expresa Ramírez, muy convencido. Entre tantas sombras, poderes y engaños, le gustaría escribir una novela de amor, pues lo considera un gran desafío y asegura que tiene muchas historias para ello. 

Y a pesar de que haberse envenenado con la enajenación del poder, el escritor mantuvo la cordura y recuerda todo con cierta nostalgia. En ese análisis, encuentra Ramírez la seducción de cada historia, &#8220;combinando a veces la ficción con la realidad&#8221;. 

Si el poder no es lo mismo que la política, entonces no hay ninguna duda. Lo ratifican más de veinte novelas, escritas por uno de los escritores más importantes de América Latina: Sergio Ramírez.
