Headline: SOC-BBC elects new vice president
Author: Elvis Ramirez / BBC Life Editor
&nbsp;
Didier "DJ" Georges was elected by student club representatives as the new vice president for the Student Organizations Council at the Biscayne Bay Campus Sept. 6.

The special election was held after the resignation of Carla St. Louis, the former SOC-BBC vice president. She resigned three weeks before the Fall semester began after accepting an internship from The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars in Washington, D.C.

"[The new vice president should be] just a person who's dedicated, wants change for the University … and who has patience. They should be prepared to make mistakes," St. Louis said. "They should come into [SOC] with an open mind and be prepared to work with the people."

The election was pushed back until the second week of the Fall semester because SOC-BBC wanted to be fair to the clubs that were not active during the summer. The organization also felt it was best to wait until after the first week of the semester, according to Ivy Siegel, the advisor for SOC and coordinator for the Department of Campus Life and Orientation.

Though clubs were informed of the election through e-mails, SOC-BBC knew that not all of the 33 clubs would be able to send representatives to the election, said Joseph "Joe" Mintz, SOC-BBC president.

During the meeting, the four candidates running for vice president were given two minutes to present themselves and their ideas before the club representatives. They were Danai Cheretis, Jose "Jay" Flores, Gabriel Labrador and Georges.

All the candidates had previous experience with SOC-BBC: Cheretis is the current marketing director for the organization, Flores was SOC-BBC treasurer last semester, Labrador has participated in different SOC-BBC clubs and Georges was a representative for the Catholic Student Association, an organization under SOC-BBC.

Mintz, who was SOC-BBC's vice president before becoming president, said that the person who became vice president had to be able to take on the president's responsibilities in the event that the president couldn't fulfill them.

"The vice president's main role is to serve as a personal assistant to the president, and to fill in when he is not there," Mintz said. "[The role of the vice president] is probably the most undefined position. If you read our constitution, it's very vague on what the vice president has to do."

During the election meeting, Georges told the SOC-BBC representatives why he was qualified for the position.

"I spoke a lot about school spirit and how I want to bring school spirit here at the Biscayne Bay Campus and I'm a guy who leads by example. I was Roary the Panther for the 30th anniversary birthday bash of BBC on June 12," said Georges, a sophomore in an e-mail to The Beacon.

The club representatives discussed each candidate's strengths and weaknesses. 

The candidate's availability was one of the biggest concerns.

Several club members brought up the fact that Labrador's other responsibilities within BBC's Student Government Council and Student Programming Council would not allow him to do the job effectively.

The student representatives liked Georges' intention to help the clubs with whatever they need.

"He seems like a very genuine guy. He's willing to put himself out there to help any of us [the SOC clubs] if necessary … He seems like the one who is more willing to go out there and help us set up if we need to because he lives on campus, and that's a plus," said Nellista Reid, SOC-BBC representative for the Invitational Scholars Club.

Georges said he plans to meet with all the clubs and begin helping them motivate students to increase school spirit. 

In his presentation, Georges explained that school spirit at BBC was incredibly low. His proposed solution is support the different clubs in their endeavors by helping them obtain funding and ensuring that SOC-BBC stands behind the clubs.

"My plan now is to meet with the clubs. Each of the clubs gets to meet one on one with Joe but I want to be there and meet with them also, and see the things they would like to do to attract more members and [how] I could help them do that," Georges said.

Headline: SAVORY SPOT: 'Fish House' doubles as museum
Author: Olivia Sarracino / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although she had been to the Oleta State Park before, Dahyana Villalobos had never been to the Blue Marlin Fish House, located within the park.

After eating the Smoked Fish Dip plate served with tortilla chips, Villalobos said she was reminded of foods from her home country of Nicaragua.

"The fish tasted really fresh because it didn't even feel like you were eating a fish dip, it tasted more like a chicken dip," said Villalobos, a public relations major at FIU. "It actually made me feel as if I was back at home with my grandmother. She used to make the best fish ever. In a way it also brought a nostalgic feeling, and not a lot of places in Miami make you feel like you are at home."

At the Blue Marlin Fish House and Outdoor Experience, visitors can engage in a day of kayaking, canoeing and learning not only about the park's wildlife, but also about the fish house's historic grounds.

The fish house offers blue marlin, salmon and mahi-mahi dishes, to name a few. The dishes come in the forms of wraps, salads and sandwiches. Some of the starters include smoked fish dip, shrimp cocktail and clam chowder.

The most popular dish is the smoked blue marlin wrap, although customers also enjoy the smoked fish chunk dip sampler, according to Maria Cassino, a fish house employee.

Colleen Guido, operator of the fish house, said the marlin in the dishes come from South America or the Pacific and is documented because they are endangered species.

The open structure is comprised of three buildings: an interactive museum, eating area and the fish house's kitchen, or smokehouse. This complex is adjoined to the Oleta River and offers a view of the high-standing mangroves that trace the river's course.

The sitting area is designed to capture the scenery.

"Sometimes you see a little of the wildlife, like barracudas, stingrays and there is a manatee zone," said Cassino, who has worked there for six months. 

Visitors can rent a kayak or a canoe along the wooden dock or pay  $2 to use their own within the park and row into downtown Miami, which is just 15 minutes away.

Inside the museum, the four walls are decorated with large posters portraying the fish house's history, and a monitor plays an audio PowerPoint, narrated by Daniel Diefenbach II, the son of the former mayor, of the history of Oleta Park as well as his personal experience of living in the historic landmark.

The PowerPoint presentation narrates how in 1938 former North Miami Beach Mayor Daniel Diefenbach established the restaurant in the banks of the Oleta River, banks which had also sheltered the Tequesta Indians in 500 B.C. 

During the 1940's, the story continues, the fish smoked by the Diefenbach family sold a fried fish dinner that offered half a pound of fried fish, hush puppies, coleslaw and chips for a dollar, according to the fish house's old menu displayed in the museum. As the advertisement read, this meal was served "hot and fresh, all in a box." 

Today, Guido operates the fish house through the Blue Moon Outdoor Center company.

Although college students currently receive a 10 percent discount with valid identification, Guido is preparing to launch a college night at the fish house on Sept. 22. It will feature a kayak night tour and a bond fire where "people can come and hang around like in the old days," Guido said. 

The fish house is currently undergoing some changes. Since there is currently no head chef at the fish house, the fish will be temporarily smoked by a local company that has been smoking fish for years.

Patricia Sanin, a usual customer at the restaurant, said the fish house reminds her of a little restaurant she used to go to off the coast of Santa Marta in Colombia while growing up. 

"There is always something out of the ordinary to see and something new to learn, like a board on the wall stating that cows are the closest land relative to the manatee," Sanin said.

Headline: The Meaning of Life...a column looking for the answers: Republican Senator's denial of sexuality not unusual
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As a Republican, I fully supported Senator Larry Craig a few days ago when he defiantly told the press he wasn't gay, despite the fact he'd recently pleaded guilty to soliciting sex in a public bathroom.

Back in high school, I tortured myself trying not to look at the other boys changing clothes in the locker room after long, humid hours running the track field.

But like Craig, I wasn't gay either - I had added my name to a petition asking the school to prevent a gay/straight alliance club from forming.

In college, I'd find a deserted corner of the campus library to read back issues of Out and The Advocate, two of the country's most popular gay lesbian bisexual and transgendered magazines, praying to God that no one would see me.

But I wasn't gay - I also prayed in church and nodded my head in approval as my father - the pastor - condemned gay marriage.

On perfectly bright afternoons, I like cruising through highways with friends while we throw words like "fag" and "queer" at each other as though they were silly insults, not to be taken seriously. By night, I do a different kind of cruising, driving to local gay clubs by myself whenever I feel particularly lonely. But I wasn't gay.

"Christ, I've never seen so many faggots in my life!" yelled a heavily intoxicated man on South Beach one night, his face contorted in disgust. I was leaving one of those clubs when I turned around to hear him say this. He was staring straight at me.

There's a list of alibis, excuses, evasions and plain lies that I use when people question my sexuality, some of which I've even told myself. But the directness of that insult left me in shock. There was nothing I could say that night: I'd been caught.

The fear of being 'caught' can be an all-consuming paranoia for those who live in the closet. An outing can make one afraid of not being accepted, of losing friendships and loves, of being treated with contempt or humiliation. But the biggest fear is a personal one: fear of confronting who you are.

I'm a registered Republican. Years ago, I volunteered at a GOP fundraising dinner where a guest speaker included homosexuals in a long list of enemies corrupting the government and our country. The speaker then asked the guests to pound their fists on the table and chant "We're taking Washington back for the Lord!" I closed my eyes and pounded along with them. I was a good Republican back then - like Craig, I told myself I couldn't be gay.

But I am.

I support Sen. Craig's decision to dispute his homosexuality. Denial is a sin, not a crime. I can even understand the fear that drove him to the life of lies, contradictions and secret rendezvous that haunt closeted gay men; much can be lost through honesty.

It's been years since I've attended any sort of Republican meeting or event, though I still have faith in the conservative ideologies that first drew me to the right: fiscal frugality, rule of law and the exaltation of rugged individualism.

I also still believe in the primacy of individual choices. Craig has decided to conform to his party's view on homosexuality and stay in the shadow. I support his right to choose that life for himself. 

What I can no longer support is choosing that life for me.

Headline: Apple cuts iPhone price, evokes mixed reactions
Author: Jordan Robertson and May Wong / AP WIRE
&nbsp;
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs apologized and offered $100 credits last week to customers who shelled out $599 for the most advanced model of the iPhone this summer, only to have the company unexpectedly slash the price $200 in a push to boost holiday sales.

In a letter on the company's web site, Jobs acknowledged that Apple disappointed some of its customers by cutting the price of the iPhone's 8-gigabyte model and said he has received hundreds of e-mails complaining about the price cut.

But Jobs added that "the technology road is bumpy," and there will always be people who pay top dollar for the latest electronics but get angry later when the price drops.

"This is life in the technology lane," Jobs said.

Jobs said Apple will hand out $100 credits for Apple's retail and online stores to any iPhone owners who aren't eligible for a rebate under the company's refund policy. 

The policy covers those who bought their phones within 14 days of the price cut.

For many of the iPhones early adopters, money is not and never was an issue, however. They were after the gratification of knowing they were among the first owners of something that was cool, even revolutionary.

"If they told me at the outset the iPhone would be $200 cheaper the next day, I would have thought about it for a second - and still bought it," said Andrew Brin, a 47-year-old addiction therapist in Los Angeles. "It was $600 and that was the price I was willing to pay for it."

Enjoying that period of being among the first - before the prices drop and reach the masses - is part of the pleasure, Brin and others say. 

And in much of the tech world, the usual expectation is that six months will pass before there's a major price cut and a year before a next generation of the product - usually an improved version - appears.

The looks of envy and attraction are an elixir.

"It's better than a dog, if you want to meet people," Brin said of his iPhone.

Immediately after the iPhone price cut was announced Wednesday, Jobs' tone was less conciliatory. 

He tartly rebuffed criticism about whether some of Apple's most die-hard fans would be miffed by the company's latest actions.

IPhone owners who bought their device that morning, he said an interview with USA Today, "should go back to where they bought it and talk to them. If they bought it a month ago, well, that's what happens in technology."

Jobs then apparently had a change of mind. 

The company is making the right decision by lowering the iPhone price, he said in his letter Thursday, but needs to "do the right thing for our valued iPhone customers."

"We need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price," he said. "Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these."

Analysts said Thursday that Jobs erred by initially dismissing the gripes of people who bought iPhones early, many of whom are Apple loyalists who felt insulted they were being overlooked in the company's zeal to sell to a broader audience.

"In the course of a day, he probably got an earful and a better sense of the extent of the discontent on the part of these very, very loyal customers," said Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. "On second and third thought, he realized these were probably the customers you most want to make sure are satisfied and retain a very positive impression about Apple overall, not just the iPhone."

Under Apple's refund policy, customers who bought an iPhone within 14 days of the price cut can get a refund of the price difference if they have the original receipt. 

Those who haven't opened the phones can return them for a full refund.

The price cut - and the phaseout of the 4-gigabyte iPhone, which retailed for $499 - came less than 10 weeks after the two products hit the market June 29 and angered some iPhone users.

Some worry that Apple is cutting the price to make up for waning demand, a concern Apple countered by saying the device is now affordable to more people. The company added that the iPhone has the potential to be a blowout seller this holiday season.

Apple has said it's on track to sell one million iPhones by the end of the current quarter.

Headline: Review: Metroid Prime 3 - Corruption (Game)
Subheadline: Metroid series ends with bang
Author: Eddie Zeng / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In 2002, Retro Studios, owned by Nintendo, made the transition from the 2-D Metroid game we once played on the original Nintendo and into a massive, 3-D first-person adventure (e.g. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion). Metroid Prime was a brand new experience by bringing players a new challenge and retaining the classic Metroid formula.

After various sequels and spin-offs, the series comes to a close with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption for the Nintendo Wii. An experience that improves upon the previous two games with new controls and gameplay that delivers absolute satisfaction.

The story in Corruption follows after the events from the second game. The series heroine, Samus Aran, receives a call from the Galactic Federation and is ordered to investigate a problem with the federation's "Aurora Unit". Throughout the adventure, players will encounter other hunters that are part of the federation and a few old enemies make a return to the game.

Gameplay utilizes most of the Wii remote's features. Since the game requires players to aim manually to shoot at enemies, there are three sensitivity settings to adjust your aim - beginner, basic and advanced. Most players would use the advanced option instead to aim with precision. Movement and aim is smooth and responsive; the experience isn't hampered. Locking-on to enemies has improved with the ability to lock on to a target while taking out enemies outside of the lock on target. Visor switching is performed by holding the minus button and pointing to the visor of choice. 

There have been several changes and new features added into the game. As a surprise to players, your heroine does not lose any of her powers at the start of the game. You simply become more powerful as you progress further. Another new feature is hyper mode, using this special mode allows Samus to utilize a different beam to shoot down enemies more efficiently. There is also an achievement system that rewards players for performing various tasks in the game.

The creative uses for the Wii remote are more creative than for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Such uses include using a nunchuk to grasp a grappling beam to trek across the terrain or interacting with control panels and turn switches to open doors. Using the morphball mode, players can flick the remote upwards to jump as oppose to using a bomb to jump.

The visuals in this game is one of the best out there for the Wii. Every planet in the galaxy you explore has its own theme and the environmental puzzles make each of them unique and challenging. The boss battles in the game are very intense; it can definitely make your wrist hurt from mashing the "A" button over and over to pound your enemy. 

In comparison with other first-person shooters that have been released for the Wii, Corruption improves upon what others have not achieved. Fluid controls and intense gameplay make Metroid Prime 3: Corruption a worthy game for Wii owners to purchase.

Headline: Review: Bioshock (Game)
Subheadline: XBox shocks with breathtaking release
Author: Kevin Castro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The first-person shooter Bioshock is perhaps best game released all year - a nuclear generator that creates a seamless fusion of narrative and gameplay - not seen in any other title thus far.

Starting the game, players are immediately placed in the action: your airplane has just crashed into the ocean. 

As a result, you must take refuge in Rapture, a failing underwater city. 

Bioshock creates an indestructible bond between you and your character as you are plunged into reflective experiences that are rarely seen in video games.

The villain of the game is Andrew Ryan, the creator of Rapture. 

He is so obsessed with the city that he places his vision above everything else, even if murder is needed to achieve his goals. 

The graphics are breathtaking - from the way the rooms are realistically constructed to the flowing movement of Rapture's giant guards - the visuals illustrate both the heights that the city managed to achieve and also the depravity that brought it to its knees.

Splicers, or genetically altered humans, are the standard enemies encountered in the game. 

As you progress through the city, you gain the ability to use plasmids, gene-alternators that give you special powers such as placing an enemy on fire. 

In order to progress through the game, you must acquire many of these plasmids, but to do this you need ADAM, a stem cell-like substance carried by the Little Sisters, small girls who are shells of their former selves. 	

The Little Sisters don't travel alone, though. They are accompanied by Big Daddies, who are consequently difficult to take down but well worth the effort. 

The combat flows nicely; each weapon has three types of ammunition, all with different effects. 

There are weapon modification stations and you are given many tonics that boost different attributes. You can even hack vending machines for cheaper ammo.

Although the game's controls feel natural and easy, the engaging storyline is what keeps your attention from start to finish. 

Bioshock is a monumental example of the perfect game that delivers an unforgettable experience.

Headline: Review: Kanye West - Graduation (Music)
Subheadline: Despite previous glory West disappoints on third album
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
In a genre that has long been dominated by artists who are more focused on ego and materialism, Kanye West has always felt like a breath of fresh air. 

Unfortunately, West's third album, the highly anticipated Graduation due out on Sept. 11 from Roc-A-Fella Records, fails to live up to the heightened expectations built by hisprevious successes.

Sure, he's rapped about the usual subjects, but behind his boasts about being the "Louis Vutton Don," was an insecure kid who was still worried about being accepted, despite having two multi-platinum albums. 

It was this quality, along with his one-of-a-kind production skills and keen sense of humor, that made his first two albums appealing to so many different groups of people, garnering five-star reviews from publications as varied as Rolling Stone and XXL, as well as an Album of the Year Grammy nomination for Late Registration.

The flaws in Graduation are apparent from the very first song, "Good Morning." Production-wise, with its dancing keys and soaring vocal sample invoking the spirit of the late J-Dilla, it can match up to any song he's ever done,  but lyrically, it has some extreme problems.

In the very first verse, he plays off of the graduation theme, stating that the song is his "dissertation"; the blandness of the following lyrics, however, suggest that perhaps even he didn't understand his own metaphor.

Fortunately, the album picks up with the next song, "Champion," a joyous, synth-laden track featuring a Steely Dan drum sample that sounds like the sequel to Late Registration's "Touch The Sky".

One of the more jarring features of the album the first time through is the overzealous use of synth on many of the songs, replacing the skittering strings and sweeping flourishes provided by Jon Brion that fleshed out so many of the songs on Registration.

In fact, the only song Brion has a production credit on is "Drunk And Hot Girls," which is arguably the worst song West has ever even been associated with.  Rather than sounding like the work of two of the most forward-thinking artists in hip-hop (Mos Def guests on the track as well), it sounds more like a bad outtake from Eminem's Encore. 

Aside from Brion's lack of involvement, the biggest ingredient missing from this album seems to be the chip that had been stuck permanently onto West's shoulder since day one. 

His best work has always come when he had something to prove, but after two best-selling albums and eight Hot 100 hits under his belt, maybe West feels like he has nothing to prove and this is where Graduation ultimately fails.

Another factor that significantly weakens Graduation is a problem that has been getting worse throughout the music industry lately, and that is saving some of the best songs from the album to release as bonus tracks on iTunes and various other retailers in order to convince fans to buy extra copies of the album.

The song "Bitterweet Poetry", featuring John Mayer, may be one of the best songs Kanye has ever done, but if you don't buy the album from iTunes, you would never know it. 

Although it has numerous high-quality songs, more than a few sure-fire hits and only one really terrible song, the album ultimately disappoints with its inconsistency.

Headline: Review: Wild Arms 5 (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Wild Arms was one the first role-playing games to debut on the original Sony PlayStation. The game's unique backdrop of an old Western atmosphere with touches of sci-fi elements has garnered the Wild Arms series quite a following over the past few years.  he series' latest installment, Wild Arms 5, marks the 10th anniversary of the series and still holds true to its early roots.

The story sounds typical enough; young aspiring golem hunter Dean Stark and childhood friend Rebecca discover a giant golem arm falling from the sky holding an amnesiac woman who remembers only her own name, Avril, and the name "Johnny Appleseed." This leads to a series of adventures to find out Avril's identity and purpose, which could decide the fate of the world, known as Filgaia.

The game play remains simple as it always has with some unique additions to the standard RPG formula. The game world itself is vast, offering a lot to be discovered; vehicles such as trains allow help you cover Filgaia's expanse.  

Exploring dungeon areas involves some basic jumping skills and item use to further progress and while you're on the world map, you can send out a search blip to discover hidden treasures as random monster encounters complement the adventure. Following Wild Arms 4, the combat system consists of players and monsters taking turns doing battle on a hexagonal grid, where actions such as attacking not only affects one character, but all those occupying a given space, giving the game welcome strategic touches such as luring an enemy to a space with debilitating effects. Players can also adjust the parameters of ancient relic machines (in other words, guns) for extra firepower and efficiency. While these features keep things interesting, the execution seems too basic and could be seen as archaic by some, even though it does work out well.

The game does a good job of portraying Filgaia's rough frontier, perhaps too well. Whether it was a design choice to reflect the barren wastelands of Filgaia or not, the game looks quite bland to today's standards, even on the aging PS2. The audio makes up for the game's lack of visual appeal with sounds and music straight out of a western, but the voice work may be a bit grating for some.

Looking at the whole package, from the simple and accessible game play and the familiar world of Filgaia, Wild Arms 5 was crafted for series fans in, and its charm still endures today. 

The game also comes with an art book chronicling the series' history though illustrations and character designs in gratitude to faithful fans. 

Although it may not win over too many new fans, Wild Arms 5 can still be enjoyed by long-time fans and role-playing enthusiasts alike.

Headline: University Budget: Proposed cuts delay Med School
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Governor Charlie Crist caught FIU by surprise Sept. 6 with the announcement of his proposed state budget cuts.

The proposed cuts include postponing the opening of FIU's and the University of Central Florida's medical schools - an action that, according to Provost Ronald Berkman, is a reversal on Gov. Crist's previous stance on the medical schools opening. 

According to Berkman, Gov. Crist considered the opening of the medical schools "a priority" and fully supported their contributions to their communities needs. Virtually all of the FIU administration was made aware of the proposed budget cuts at the same time shortly before The Miami Herald broke the story.

"We had no advance warning," Berkman said. 

In Crist's proposal there are over 250 specific line items proposed to be cut from the state's budget. Four of them directly involve FIU. (Refer to Info Box)

"The University community is already working on a thoughtful, sober plan to make the required cuts to our overall University budget based on the state's financial reality," President Modesto A. Maidique said in a press release issued Sept. 6. "These additional cuts undermine our common goal of providing affordable educational opportunities to students throughout South Florida and fostering the economic development of our state."

The proposed budget plan comes amidst the State universities already planning a general budget cut of 6.2 percent due to low state revenues.

According to Viviana Jordan, director of legislative affairs for the Student Government Council at University Park, some of the proposed cuts are surprising because they were already approved and appropriated funds by the State Legislature.

"The fact that it's [saying until the legislature recuperates] on the Med school line item, doesn't give me a set amount of time [before funding for the College of Medicine would be issued]," Jordan said.

Also causing controversy is $80 million that has been earmarked for the University of Miami and will not be subject to the state budget cuts. The funds will be used to establish a new Institute of Human Genomics - the study of an organism's genetic material.

"UM gets $80 million for research in a specific area. That's a little unusual when we are starving," said Carolyn Roberts, chairman of the Board of Governors in an article published Sept. 6 in the Palm Beach Post. "It would be my hope that we would be protected from some of the cuts."

According to Berkman, if the Legislature does follow Gov. Crist's plan and goes back on its agreement, FIU will not be able to afford opening the College of Medicine on schedule and the University would not have any legal recourse.

"We're hoping the Legislature honors their commitment in the budget," Berkman said. 

Although the Legislature has made no mention on whether the development of either school will be postponed indefinitely, Maidique has faith that they both are still top priorities.

"I'm absolutely convinced we have the support from the Legislature to continue," Maidique told The Beacon.

When asked about the $80 million, Maidique commented that the money is not coming out of the State University System.

FIU has already hired faculty and signed an affiliation agreement with Jackson Memorial Hospital to provide care to the indigent. FIU has also received approval for an accreditation site visit by the Liaison Committee for Medical Education, the accrediting agency in medical education for the College of Medicine, according to Maidique's Sept. 6 press release.

The State University System will be impacted most by the proposed cuts according to Bill Edmonds, director of communications for the BOG State University System of Florida. 

A statement released Sept. 6 from the Office of the Chancellor said that the overall proposed cuts equal $227 million or 28 percent of all of Gov. Crist's proposed cuts. 

"We didn't expect to be put in a special place [where we would not receive any cuts]," Edmonds said. "But we don't see this as our fair share."  

A special session of the Legislature to address the budget was scheduled for later this month but was abruptly cancelled after agreements could not be reached as to how the cuts should be handled according to Berkman. 

While no plans have been made, a proposed trip to Tallahassee for the next Legislature meeting has been made an option, according to Jordan. 

Of all the Universities that have specific line item cuts proposed by Gov. Crist, FIU has the most: four. 

The University of Central Florida and Florida State University have two.

From the direct proposed cuts, FIU would stand to lose approximately $10 million. 

In the Sept. 6 press release, Maidique encourages those students who wish to voice their concerns or opinions directly, to contact their elected officials at http://government.fiu.edu.

Headline: Bank services, fees under review
Author: David Shaw / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Like hundreds of other students, when Opal Nugent's in a money bind, she heads over to the Wachovia ATM in the Graham Center.

But because she is not a Wachovia customer, Nugent gets greeted with a $2.25 service fee.

"They have inconvenienced me greatly," Nugent said.

Currently, only Wachovia or University Credit Union members have a way to avoid fees while banking on campus, but that could change very soon. 

There is hope that some services might be offered in conjunction with the ATM service that would give customers who weren't members of the bank a chance to withdraw money without paying a service fee.

Only three ATMs serve the more than 30,000 students that pass through UP daily. 

In addition to the Wachovia ATM next the stairs behind The Pit in GC, there is also an ATM operated by the University Credit Union by the main entrance to GC, which charges a service fee of $1.50 to any non-credit union withdrawals. The third ATM, whose service charge is $1.95, is located in the Breezeway Café by the Housing Quad.

One proposal is an upgraded PantherCARD.

According to PantherCARD Coordinator Mercedes Cesin, the PantherCARD works as a cash card that can be used anywhere on campus and is used by many parents to manage students' spending by periodically adding money to the card. The PantherCARD doesn't work exactly like a bankcard; students can't use it to make cash withdrawals.

According to Felecia Townsend, director of Business Services at University Park campus, the contract for all banking services at FIU are being put on bid through a Request for Proposal. 

The RFP is sent by the University to potential vendors to specify what services the University wants, gives a chance for vendors to respond and allows the University to decide whether or not to start negotiations with the potential vendors.

"We're doing research to determine what is out there," Townsend said. "We will be putting the credit service out to bid along with banking services, ATM machines, etc. The bid itself will be more attractive to investors."

The Office of Business Services declined a second interview and referred The Beacon to The Office of Media Relations.

 According to Media Relations, though business services was first trying to compose the RFP in-house, the task has been outsourced.

"[Business Services] has abandoned the effort to put together an RFP in-house and are now in the process of hiring a consultant who specializes in that area," Media Relations said in an e-mail.

Townsend was on vacation and was not available to answer follow-up questions on what this meant.

Currently, the bank that FIU affiliates with and promotes for student use is the University Credit Union while Bank of America also offers banking services to FIU. The lease for the space the University Credit Union occupies was up in September 2006 and is currently operating on a month-to-month contract that can expire at any time.

Marbely Hernandez, president of UP-Student Government Council, who represents the student body and communicates with Townsend, has already worked on some ways of improving the services available through the PantherCARD. 	

Hernandez is interested in offering services such as meal equivalency and the ability to use the card as a debit card outside of the University.

"It would be good to have a bank that would be available around town so students could be able to use banks at the mall or other areas around town without worry," Hernandez said.

Headline: Students join Peru's disaster efforts
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If the two minutes that lasted the 8.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Peru Aug. 15 were the worst of the experience, then at least the frightening episode would have been over three weeks ago. 

As every nation that has been struck by a natural disaster knows, the most frustrating, challenging and unsettling feelings occur with what happens after the fact. 

An earthquake of such a magnitude had not hit the country since 1974. According to the National Civil Defense Institute of Peru, the official statistics include 503 people dead and 1,042 people injured. 

In less than 48 hours,  the Peruvian consulate in Miami was carrying out relief efforts throughout Miami-Dade County. 

The Flor de la Canela Restaurant, located at 11865 Southwest 26 St., is one of the relief coordination centers. 

Peruvian student Fiorella Castillo and her sister accidentally stumbled upon the chance to help out at the Flor de la Canela site. 

"After collecting everything [from the list of medical items needed] we went to the restaurant. We were just planning to drop everything off," Castillo said. 

Instead, she stayed for two hours helping out in the medicine area checking labels and expiration dates. 

Approximately 40 rotating volunteers at the restaurant pulled through hours of work in intense heat but with true philanthropist zeal. 

The rest of the FIU student body is not blind to the hardships that the Peruvian people have ahead of them. 

The Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity Inc., is focusing on organizing events to help out the community. 

"Just because [Hispanics] don't live in South America doesn't mean that they have to be unaware of the problems that are facing our people," said Luis Ramirez, the alumni advisor to the fraternity on campus.

With that in mind, Ramirez, with the help of a fraternity brother, Emilio Botts, have organized an event on campus called Operation P.E.R.U: Peru Earthquake Relief Union. 

Operation P.E.R.U, which is supported by the Red Cross and UNICEF, will be set up on the Betty Chapman Plaza Sept. 24 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. 

The event will raise funds and increase awareness in the Hispanic community. Ramirez hopes that the FIU students on campus will volunteer for the event or bring money donations, canned  goods and supplies for the families and especially the children hit by the earthquake. 

Another group of FIU students organizing Peru relief efforts is Jack's Notes, a new company run by FIU students that offers class lecture notes and study guides. Jack's Notes will donate one dollar for every study packet sold during September and October to the Peruvian Consulate.

"If you have been looking at the videos of the earthquake, you see the poverty that these people lived in before and now it must be a lot worse," said Alex Gutierrez, co-owner of the company. 

Jack's Notes will also function as a supplies drop-off point and is organizing a fundraising football tailgate party.

With buildings to reconstruct, highways to mend, people to house and feed, in a zone that stretches nearly 200 miles along the coast of Peru, Peruvian President Alan Garcia and the victims have massive work ahead of them.

Headline: Center closes after losing funds
Author: Luis Valdez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The National Resource Center of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Aging has provided health and nutritional services to older adults in the community for the last 17 years. However, due to a lack of funding by the federal government, it will close down next June.  

The center's director, Nancy Wellman, is a prominent figure on campus and has been nationally recognized for her work. Last year, she received FIU's "Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty" award for her research and involvement in various organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the International Food Information Council. 

According to Wellman, the more attention nutrition gets, the more money it receives from Washington and that lately it has been sidelined. 

"It's ironic that nutrition is not given much emphasis by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services compared to other programs such as the food-stamps, Women-Infant-Children and school nutrition," Wellman said. 

One of the main missions of the center is to reduce the risks associated with aging and bad nutrition, a service that is mostly offered to older adults and minorities with health issues. This includes counseling, information, the "meals-on-wheels," research and exercise tips.

The center's goal is to support quality of life, improve functionality, promote independence and decrease early nursing home admissions and hospitalizations, through better nutrition.

The center is completely funded by the U.S. Administration on Aging in the form of multi-year grants, the center's Web site states. 

According to Barbara Kamp, the project coordinator, the center's budget is at the full discretion of HHS.

"[HHS] did not give us any priority," Kamp said.  

The center currently has nine staff members including a few student assistants. Marsha Hakim, one of the five graduate and undergraduate students working there, helps keep the biweekly highlights up-to-date on the center's Web site along with other responsibilities. She one of close to 100 graduate students who have worked at the center over the past 17 years. She is very disappointed at the future closing of the center.

 "I love it so much. It was really a blessing in disguise and I am torn by the fact that it is closing down. It gave me a lot of great experience and knowledge," Hakim said. 

Besides dealing with issues of health, nutrition and aging, the center also gives technical assistance to national agencies such as the Older Americans Act Nutrition, which provides meals to about 2.6 million elderly Americans every year.

One of the features of the center's Web site is a physical inactivity cost calculator, which shows the financial cost of a physically inactive person to his or her community.

 Federal funding to the center will stop this December; it will be running on its own means, with some of the leftover funding from previous grants, until June. Because the services the center provides are free, it won't gain any revenue to support its operations. Until then, the center will continue with its various activities and programs.

Wellman plans to keep helping older adults by providing tasty nutritious food and health counseling through the National Aging Network. She plans to use the center to serve our community to the very end.

Headline: Exhibit reveals propaganda in children's books
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It's hard to believe that books with passages such as, "any person who tells us that this war isn't any of our business doesn't know what he's talking about," can qualify as a children's book. 

Yet My Book to Help America (1942) is just that: and the current exhibit at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami Beach, Indoctrinating Youth: Selections from the Pamela K. Harer Gift of Propaganda Books for Children, presents a variety of books, the earliest from the Boer War, with similar war messages.

Surprisingly, the exhibit at the Wolfsonian's library vestibule showcases how different governments have influenced generations of children through a means that most parents would find safe. 

"Some of the books were either overtly sponsored by governments or encouraged by governments but done by private individuals who were just patriotic," said Frank Luca, chief librarian of the Wolfsonian. 

The content of a couple of books, such as one encouraging children to buy stamps or conduct scrap drives for the war, and another promoting laughter as the means to defeat Hitler, seem innocent enough. 

Nonetheless, it's hard to call the books subtle as the majority of them depict strong war images such as children happily wearing gas masks and an alphabet book from World War II with Adolf Hitler, Hermann Goring and Joseph Goebbs in stocks on the cover. Even others demonize the enemy by casting the opponents in negative stereotypes or as threatening animals like wolves.    

"One of the things that makes this such an amazing collection is that it shows different players in the various wars, especially during World War I and World War II," Luca said. 

One person not surprised by the content in the exhibition is Professor Brian Peterson from the History Department at FIU. An expert on Nazi Germany and Soviet Communism, Peterson explained that propaganda was a big thing during the Nazi and Soviet totalitarian societies, which tried to control everyone's thinking and life. 

"They especially wanted to get to children while they were young," Peterson said.

He mentioned that youth programs like the American Boy Scouts were also popular ways of fostering nationalist sentiments in the children. The Nazi version of the Boy Scouts was called the Hitler Youth.

While there were similarities between American, Nazi and Soviet propaganda, Peterson added that the dividing line seems to be setting the children against their parents, something that was encouraged in totalitarian states.

Peterson mentioned a famous story from the Soviet Union involving a peasant boy who reports his father for anti-communist sentiments to Soviet authorities. The boy was considered a hero by the communist leaders.  

While the exhibit at the Wolfsonian only has 23 books, it can be considered a preview to an enlarged exhibition that will open December at the Green Library in University 

Park and which will also include a wide range of contemporary books, war games and three-dimensional propaganda pieces from the Boer War, WWI and WWII. 

"It will be a different look at propaganda and censorship. Posters and usual advertisement makes [propaganda] seem more adult," said Althea "Vicki" Silvera, the department head and university librarian of the Special Collections section of GL. 

"I look forward to the exhibition because I have never tied childhood with propaganda before."

Headline: LENDING A HELPING HAND: Opportunities abound for students seeking to serve
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Community service is mandatory if you attend a public high school in Florida, but after completing the hours needed to graduate, many students do not continue charity work.  

For students who want to continue volunteer work into their college years, the Center for Leadership and Service provides students with easy access to numerous community service projects, according to the center's Associate Director Patricia Temiño. 

"It's a great way for students to get involved without having to put in serious commitment to an organization," Temiño said. "It doesn't take a group of people - one person counts."

Temiño also said that many of the groups the CLS gathers volunteers for are small and non-profit. To make volunteering easier, most projects are done on the weekend, so that a student busy with work and school won't have to shirk duties to help others.

Interested students who don't know what's going on each week can sign up for one of the copies of Roary's Community Calendar that the center sends out each week. 

One of the events being promoted by CLS is Alternative Breaks, formerly known as Alternative Spring Break. 

The one-week community service project involves students spending their spring break helping communities around the world rather than getting drunk on the world's finest beaches. 

Shawn Sprockett, a co-director of Alternative Breaks, commented that the program has become so popular at FIU that it has expanded to include the Winter break and a weekend during the Fall semester. 

Sprockett has been participating in Alternative Breaks for three years now and said that students who end up participating their senior year of college wish they had done so earlier.  

The cost for participating in Alternative Breaks is $100, which includes a week of board and food. 

If going on a trip for a week isn't possible for you, you may want to try a two day event such as Relay for Life. 

The overnight event is aimed at raising money for finding a cure for cancer. The American Cancer Society funds this international event. 

Last year's relay, held at University Park, raised over $60,000 with the participation of over 50 teams.  

The next relay will be held from February 15 to 16 in 2008. 

Another large community service event is Dance Marathon, which will be held on March 1 and 2. DM is FIU's largest student run philanthropy project, according to CLS coordinator and DM advisor Mariela Campuzano. 

It will be held at the UP fitness center and will be celebrating its 11th year this year. 

DM raises money for the Miami Children's Hospital with a series of events held through a 25-hour period. 

According to Campuzano, dancing means you don't sit down or fall asleep for the 25 hours. 

"We have a schedule for every 15 minutes," Campuzano said. "And we have an infinite amount of possibilities to get involved."

Anyone can participate in DM with a pledge of $140 per person,though Campuzano encourages groups of five to enter with a pledge of $700. Last July, FIU's DM was awarded Best Moral Dance Line and Most Improved Dance Marathon by the Children's Miracle Network conference. 

"Those were great stepping stones," Campuzano said.

Participants are also given a meal every three hours from various sponsors such as Chicken Kitchen and Pasta Factory Express. 

But one of the real treats for participants is when families visit and share stories of how they have been helped by the funds raised by DM. 

Besides the feelings participants get from volunteering at the various events, students can literally get a medal for the charity work, the Medallion of Distinction. 

For more information on the medal and future events, representatives are available for questions at the CLS offices: GC 242, GC 2210 and WUC 256 at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Headline: School mascot more cheerful than his predecessor
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
What do FIU students know about their own mascot, Roary the Golden Panther? They know he is a huge FIU sports fan. They know he has school spirit and they know that he is able to walk on two legs - something most panthers can't do. 

To get a little more background on Roary, The Beacon got in contact with his good friends at the FIU ticket office in the Pharmed arena. 

"He's known for jumping up and down," said Drew Auguste, the FIU ticket office manager and a good friend of Roary. "He does a little dancing, and he does a little cheer the FIU cheerleaders taught him. He gets the crowd going."

Auguste then pulled a few strings, made some calls and setup a rare interview with Roary himself. Roary showed up for the interview in his dark blue FIU T-Shirt, white sneakers and blue FIU sports shorts - with a hole in the back for his tale. 

To make up for the fact that Roary is unable to speak - like all panthers - he was asked a series of yes or no questions regarding FIU football.



The Beacon: Do you think FIU football will have a winning season?

Roary: Nods vigorously.

The Beacon: Are you excited to spend this football season at the Orange Bowl?

Roary: Nods vigorously.

The Beacon: If you did not have a tendency to deflate footballs with your claws, do you think you would be a good football player?

Roary: Nods vigorously. Makes throwing motion to suggest playing Quarterback. Strikes Heisman pose. Points to his Finger to indicate where he would wear his national championship ring. Strikes Heisman pose, again.



Back in 2001, there was another Roary on the FIU campus. Professional zoologists would refer to that Roary as a "real" Golden Panther. He was brought to a football scrimmage to pose for pictures with fans. "It wasn't really a mascot per se," said Associate Athletic Director Mike Garrity. "It was just a panther that they brought out for one scrimmage in the year before we played games in 2001; in what we called the practice year." 

Garrity added, "It was only meant to be a one time thing; we always had the mascot Roary. It's tough to get an animal out here, especially a Golden Panther, which I believe is endangered."

It's unknown exactly what happened, but after the event the panther's cage was found open and empty and the campus' wildlife reserve, which is located very close to the football fields, had a new resident. Luckily, the panther's trainers and campus police were able to remove the panther before anything serious happened. 

Unlike his "real" panther counterpart, Roary the mascot is not at all bloodthirsty or on the campus police's most wanted list. On the contrary, he is very nice and has many friends at FIU. 

Some of his best friends are, of course, the Golden Panther Cheerleaders and Golden Dazzlers. 

"Roary brings spirit and fun to the games and it's exciting to see him jump around and it makes us more energetic," said Genna Soven, Co-Captain of the FIU Cheerleading squad. "When he comes by, he will throw his hands up in the air and just be Roary."

While Roary does not do any real routines with the cheerleaders, he does interact with them on the sidelines. Occasionally they will jump on his back and at least one cheerleader has descried him as "cuddly." 

If you want to meet Roary, your best bet is at an FIU sporting event where he is frequently seen prowling the sidelines, doing his FIU cheer, hyping up the crowd, fraternizing with the cheerleaders and doing his best to inspire FIU to victory.

Headline: Big contracts might lead to big letdowns
Author: Tim Dahlberg / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Barry Zito thinks more deeply about most things than the average major leaguer. 

At $18 million a year, he also makes more money than most of the guys who play the game for a living.

The combination, along with a terrible start with his new team this season, makes Zito uniquely qualified to talk about the pressures of performing for pay.

"The truth is that I've never pitched with a number on my forehead," Zito said the other night in Washington, D.C.

Zito was speaking figuratively, of course, but he's not alone. He might as well have $126 million tattooed on his forehead this season, just like Carlos Zambrano might have $91.5 million.

Put $17.4 million just below the bill of the cap on Roger Clemens while you're at it.

Everyone in the ballpark knows what they make on the day they pitch, from the guy selling beer in the upper deck to those sitting in the pricey seats down below.

With the windfalls come the burden of expectations even Cy Young would have trouble delivering.

"You want to be everything for everyone," Zito said. "You want to show everyone that you're worth every dollar."

That's an impossible task given that Zito makes in one night what the average school teacher makes in 10 years. 

But most of us have long since accepted the fact that baseball salaries will always be far out of whack with what goes on in the real world.

Still, it's hard to feel sorry for someone making that kind of money, no matter how tough it gets on the field.

Clemens is as sure a lock for the Hall of Fame as there is, but that didn't stop Yankee fans from booing him off the mound after a rocky start last month. 

The Yankees coughed up some $24 million for Clemens this year, an investment that has gotten them six wins, some innings eaten up and little else.

Dodger fans can't boo Jason Schmidt, because they can't find him. Schmidt signed for $47 million over three years during the offseason. 

But Schmidt won only one game in six starts before undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery.

Although Boston fans have spent lifetimes perfecting the art of being patient, they have to be growing increasingly anxious about heading 



Pitching, Page 10

Pitching, Page 12



into the playoffs with the pitcher they spent so many millions for struggling on the mound. 

That would be Daisuke Matsuzaka, who nearly blew a nine-run lead Monday over Toronto and has given up at least five runs in three of his last four starts.

The average fan struggling to pay his mortgage and still take his family to the ballpark once in awhile can relate to the numbers Zito puts up on the mound, but not the ones on his paycheck.

Zito can talk about it with a bit more perspective now because he's pitching better _ a 1.24 ERA to show for the $2 million he earned for his last four starts. 

But he's 9-11 with a big ERA, the season is long over for the Giants, and their one big free agent signing has so far pretty much been a bust.

The good news, though, is that number on his forehead doesn't look quite as big anymore. 

And Zito has Carlos Zambrano, his agent, and the always desperate Chicago Cubs to thank for that.

Yes, that Carlos Zambrano, last seen wondering out loud why Cubs fans were booing him at Wrigley Field the same way fans in San Francisco booed Zito earlier this summer. 

The same Carlos Zambrano who last month signed a new contract that took some of the pressure off Zito by making him the highest priced pitcher with a multiyear contract at $18.3 million a year.

The same Carlos Zambrano who is 0-5 with an 8.29 ERA in six starts since beating Cincinnati more than a month ago and can't figure out why Cubs fans seem to care.

"I thought these were the greatest fans in baseball. They showed me today they just care about them," Zambrano said Monday after he was shelled in his latest outing. "That's no fair."

It's not fair to pay 35 bucks for a seat in the upper deck or $9.50 for a beer, either, but those are the prices fans must pay to fund the ever increasing arms race in baseball. 

And pay they do, packing ballparks so often this year that baseball likely will set a new attendance record.

They want results for their hard-earned cash. 

And the guy with the big contract standing on the mound can be an awfully big target.

Some, like Chan Ho Park with the Texas Rangers, never figure it out. 

Others like Kevin Brown in his final year with the Yankees just collect their paychecks and don't seem to try.

Zito, though, thinks he finally understands. A season of pain has given him a new outlook on success.

The best part is he's still got six years to prove his worth.

"It's all in how you view it," he said in Washington. "It's like a freshly waxed car _ the water just beads off, doesn't affect you at all."

"That's where you want to be. Then you pitch out there under your own circumstances instead of pitching under everybody else's."

&nbsp;
The FIU women's soccer season began with  the Florida Gulf Coast Tournament against the University of North Florida Lady Ospreys and the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles  Aug. 31-Sept 2. 



FIU 1, UNF 1 (2OT) Tie



The season opener for the Golden Panthers (0-1-1) was 85 minutes of defensive suffocation by the Lady Ospreys. With just five minutes left in the game, the Lady Ospreys held a 1-0 lead over the Golden Panthers due to Elizabeth Gowan splitting the Panthers' defense and striking the first goal of the game. 

The Panthers would retaliate at the 86th minute with a shot from 25 yards out by sophomore midfielder Marina Pappas.The double overtimes saw the Panthers out-shoot the Lady Opreys 5-3 to no avail as the game ended in a 1-1 tie.



FGC 3, FIU 2 (OT)



The offenses were in full force, as the Panthers played a back and forth game against the Eagles in another overtime match. 

The Panthers struck first with a header by freshman midfielder Amy Jackson. The Eagles would quickly respond 10 minutes later with an easy goal one-on-one versus the keeper.

Both teams tacked on another goal during regulation until overtime began. This overtime lasted a mere two minutes with Lindsey Haw scoring the game-winner.

Middle linebacker Zach Thomas has proved he can play beyond what his 5-foot, 11-inch frame would suggest.

He has seven Pro Bowl appearances, but as he enters his 12th year with the Miami Dolphins, the most of any active player, Thomas is still searching for playoff success. He has yet to play in an AFC championship game, much less the Super Bowl, and his team last reached the playoffs in 2001.

"I just want to get back _ get back to winning," Thomas said.

He hopes the turnaround will start Sunday when Miami opens the season at Washington.

The Dolphins finished 6-10 in 2006, only their third losing season since 1969. Thomas takes defeat hard, teammate Channing Crowder said.

"He's not a very good loser _ or a good winner," Crowder said. "If we lose, he's mad at the world. If we win, he's mad at himself. He's real self-critical. I guess that's what makes you a great player."

Thomas started every game last season and led the team in tackles for the 10th time. His play was a bright spot during a disappointing season, but he was still overshadowed by teammate Jason Taylor, the 2006 NFL Defensive Player of the Year.

"He had a great, great year last year," said Taylor, who is Thomas' brother-in-law. "Zach is still young enough to do what he needs to do at a very high level, and never gets the respect he should. Zach blows away half the guys I hear talked about all the time. One day people will realize how good a player he really was."

Linebacker Joey Porter joined the Dolphins this year after eight seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers and quickly developed a new appreciation for Thomas.

"I used to laugh at how short he was," Porter said, "and when I got here, he really was that short. But he plays like he's 6-3."

Thomas, who turned 34 on Sept. 1, jokes about his hairline, but refuses to think about retiring.

"They always say that I'm running on fumes, but I feel like I've got years to play," Thomas said. "I think my last couple years have been the better of my years. And they say I'm aging, but I don't see that."

As they rebuild this season under new coach Cam Cameron, the Dolphins will again rely on an experienced defense that ranked fourth in the NFL last year. Thomas said he doesn't consider anyone a star on the defense, but rather looks to all his teammates to lead.

"We've got to have everybody on the same page with this type of defense," Thomas said. "If my defensive line is playing bad, I'm playing bad. If our secondary's playing bad, Jason's playing bad. We all depend on each other. That's the way the team works, and people don't understand that. You don't have single good players if you don't have anything around you."

Thomas is eager for the season to start his 12th season, and his drive and determination is evident to Porter.

"There are rare players in this league who can walk away and don't get kicked out of the league," Porter said. "And I think he's one of those guys. When he's tired of playing, he'll stop playing. But I think there will always be a spot on any team for him."

Golden Panthers establish partnership with Miami-Dade Schools

	

Athletic Director Pete Garcia announced an agreement with Dade County Public Schools on Sept. 5 to give Miami-Dade County students the opportunity to attend FIU football home games for free this season. 

Looking to expand its fan base, FIU has agreed to a partnership with Miami-Dade that will allow student's to attend games at the historic Orange Bowl, where FIU will be playing all of their home 2007 football games. 

Garcia said that one of the main reasons for doing this is to allow young football fans the opportunity to witness a game in the history stadium during it's final season.

To go along with the ticket program, FIU also plans to work with schools on the DARE program and on FCAT rallies through the Panthers with a Purpose program.



FIU Alum making strides in NFL



Last season saw a record number of former FIU football players get drafted or signed by NFL teams. Linebacker Antwan Barnes was drafted in the 4th round by the Baltimore Ravens and wide receiver Chandler Williams being drafted in the 7th round by the Minnesota Vikings.

Barnes has been making a name for himself in Ravens camp, moving up to 2nd on the right outside linebacker depth chart behind Pro Bowler Terrell Suggs. 

Barnes has been compared to Suggs and may end up lined up opposite Suggs a few plays a game if the Ravens want to go with a set specified to rush the quarterback a little more as both players excel in the pass rushing game. For now, Barnes will be making himself seen mostly on the Eagles special teams.

Barnes even recieved some national attention, as a bone crushing block he put on Philadelphia Eagles punter Sav Rocca was shown numerous times on ESPN's Sportscenter, and NFL Live listed it as one of the top plays of the preseason.

Williams was recently cut by the Vikings and has found his way back to South Florida, as the Dolphins recently signed him to their practice squad. If Ted Ginn Jr's ankle injury flares up again early in the season, Williams may eventually see time with the team as a special teams player. 

Along with the players who were drafted, several former Golden Panthers were signed as free agents in the days following the draft. Safety Chris Smith was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles, though was recently cut from their squad. 

Linebacker Keyonvis Bouie was last seen on the New Orleans Saints practice squad and quarterback Josh Padrick had a brief tryout with the Jacksonville Jaguars, though it nothing came from it.

To go along with those on the class of 2006, safety Nick Turnbull, the first FIU player to appear in an NFL game, was recently cut by defending NFC Champion Chicago Bears and was picked up by the first team to give him a chance, the Atlanta Falcons. He will look to contribute to their special teams once again.

Headline: Commentary: Intramural sports parallel official athletic programs
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The majority of collegiate athletes are indirectly paid to play sports in which they have excelled. 

Division 1-A recruits are given scholarships and free housing, but why is it that the term student-athlete is reserved for students involved in athletic programs? 

Intramural sports provide a means of giving students an opportunity to participate in team play and competition. 

Conversely, intramural participants pay to be on a team. The act of paying to play a sport conveys the passion they have for a diverse set of sports. 

Intramural teams are not perceived as real teams because they are not as organized as collegiate teams and, most importantly, they do not generate revenue. 

But aside from the lack of fiscal rewards, there is no concrete difference between an intramural football team and a collegiate football team.

Players on intramural squads are still part of a team. They go out on the field or court and they have to communicate and depend on each other. 

The players also run plays like any other official FIU team and some squads even practice five times a week. 

And all the teams have either a coach or team captain to lead and organize practices.  

The intensity of the intramural games also matches -  and sometimes even surpasses - several regular season FIU home games. 

This past Spring, the Men's Fraternity Soccer Intramural Championship match between the fraternities Tau Kappa Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta featured Teke and FIJI members in the stands with flags and painted faces. 

The two teams had faced off in previous years and the returning players all had sour tastes in their mouths. 

The massive celebration by the Tekes and the lowered heads of the Fiji players indicated and gauged how much the rivarly meant to the fraternities.  

In football, the closest thing to a rivalry the Golden Panthers have is against the University of Miami, and it is unsure whether the teams will continue to play after their game this season.

Therefore, FIU intramural rivalries are as concrete as any FIU programs' vendettas. 

In addition, this is an opportunity for students to partake in a recreational activity with fellow students. 

Some students may have played sports in high school, but decided not to continue playing in college. 

Intramurals allow these players to still practice their hobby in a controlled, in-game atmosphere.

One of the reasons why intramural sports are not popular is because the participants are not perceived as athletic enough. 

The most important reason intramural sports are not popular goes back to capitalism - the leagues do not produce revenue. Intramural promotions are meager and do not reach a wide audience on campus.

However, a new outlet and a chance to watch friends play on a competitive field should be promoted more effectively. 

This spring, the Men's Fraternity Soccer Intramural Championship Game will attract crazed fans full of pride for their respective team. 

They will all be cheering for their friends who happen to be student-athletes.

Headline: Commentary: Women's Volleyball shines among this season's fall sports
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
With FIU football, volleyball and soccer already underway and cross country and track beginning in the next few weeks, every single one of these teams has a blank slate with which to build upon. 

With an entire season ahead of them, each of these teams can go into the season with high hopes because, as the old adage goes, everyone is in first place on opening day.

Even the embattled football team, fresh off an 0-12 season, has high expectations despite having one of the toughest out of conference schedules in the nation. 

With new head coach Mario Cristobal at the helm, there is reason to have hope for the future for the program, but sadly, that future is still a long way away, as evidenced by the team's 59-0 loss to Penn State in the season opener. 

The soccer teams are also looking forward to new eras filled with success as new head coaches Munga Eketebi and Thomas Chestnutt take over the men's and women's teams, respectively. Despite the new head coaches, neither team has been able to secure a victory thus far in the season.

Expectations for the men's team are higher, but both squads need to see more offensive production out of returning players if they are to surpass their performances from last season.

Last season saw an early conference tournament exit for the men and a failure to reach the conference tournament from the women's squad.

While each of these programs has seen significant turnover in the past year, one roster that has seen very little change from last season is the women's volleyball team.

This team returns many of its impact players from last year's regular season Sun-Belt Conference Championship squad - including honorable mention All-American sophomore Yarimar Rosa and conference All-Tournament first teamer senior Keila Oliveira.

Despite the returning players, the team has seen some inconsistency, defeating a strong Missouri team and losing to a weaker Notre Dame team during the Tiger Invitational at Missouri held Sept. 1 and 2.

Indeed, of all of the sports taking place this season here at FIU, the women's volleyball team may be the only one with a chance at real success this season. 

While I am as big a fan as anyone here of the football team, it is simply unrealistic to expect FIU to be able to compete with the likes of Penn State, Kansas, Arkansas or the University of Miami in the immediate future. 

Sure, we could be the next Appalachian State and pull off a massive upset in one of these games, but a more likely outcome is a repeat of the result of the Penn State game Sept. 1. 

The fact of the matter is that outside of the volleyball team, we don't have the talent right now to see the type of success we all want to see. 

Hopefully, if things go right, we will be build up to where we get to that level, but for now, it's an unrealistic goal. 

And the same goes for the soccer teams. It is important to remember that these three programs are all still trying to implement new systems and will experience some growing pains before, hopefully, blossoming into competitive, strong programs.

With any luck, next fall will prove to be more competitive and successful for FIU sports, but for now, there isn't too much to look forward to this year.

Headline: Anti-Obama protesters don't speak for Miami
Author: Chris Cabral / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
There were no more than 30 of them, these anti-Obama protesters, holding signs and shouting insults at the more than 1,500 people who were gathering across the street, waiting to hear the Senator from Illinois speak Aug. 25 at the Miami-Dade Auditorium in Little Havana. The protesters were few, but what they lacked in numbers, they made up for with yells of angry rhetoric; occasional, vaguely threatening gestures and a very loud megaphone. 

"Obama, Miami doesn't want you!" shouted one of the protesters. They ostensibly spoke for all of Miami. 

Forget the almost 2,000 people who paid to watch the presidential candidate give a 45 minute speech. But only a few of his supporters had signs - and not one had a megaphone.

The protesters were angry over Obama's statement that he'd meet with leaders of hostile countries-including Cuba's Fidel Castro.  

Obama also said he'd lift travel restrictions for Cuban Americans to visit family members on the island. The senator also supports letting them send unlimited remittances to family members. These statements didn't spark much controversy in other places throughout the country, like Idaho. But in South Florida, supporting anything other than an absolute hard-line approach to Cuba can make some of the more right-wing members of the Miami community throw a fit.

Of course, there isn't a single politician in this country, Republican or Democrat, who would ever claim to be pro-Castro. Yet, judging by the level of animosity and venom coming from those who "didn't want" him there, you'd think anyone supporting a change in Cuban-American policy was a card-carrying member of the Fidel Castro fan club. 

But today, many Cuban Americans are fed up with the current policy toward Cuba. According to The Miami Herald, an FIU poll found that 55 percent of Cuban Americans  in Miami-Dade actually favor lifting restrictions that  ban Cuban Americans from visiting  the island  more often than once every three years. 

This suggests that, among the Cuban American community, opinions regarding America's Cuba policy is less cut-and-dry than commonly assumed. 

Of course, among those who see the phantom of Castro lurking behind every call for change in Cuban policy, even this poll has come under attack. 

"This is another one of those annual `push polls' done by those who want to unilaterally ease sanctions to benefit the Castro regime," Republican state representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart's chief of staff told McClatchy news services. 

In reality, the poll was funded by the Cuba Study Group and the Brookings Institution. Neither group is a communist organization.

If we assume the poll wasn't red propaganda put out by Castro's minions, it stands as evidence that Obama's position doesn't really  put him at odds with the Cuban American community. 

What it suggests is that right-wing hardline members don't necessarily represent the majority of the Cuban community - even if they have big signs and megaphones. 

As The Miami Herald put it, the content of Obama's speech was hardly inflammatory. 

And there was more common ground between Obama and the protesters than was apparent at first glance. 

Both deplore the treatment of political prisoners. Both decry the Castro regime. And both express that the desire for "liberty" in Cuba should be a guiding principle in America's policy toward the island. 

Yet only one participant in this debate - namely, the protesters - insisted on tarring their opponent by equating Obama with Castro, Communism and the death of liberty itself. 

It is this negative brand of politics that Obama always denounces in his speeches, along with his desire to end it. 

The small crowd shouting outside the event may have made noise, but the presence of the hundreds who came to see Obama speak delivered a loud and powerful message. The people of Miami, and the entire nation, want the debate over America's policies to change. They want an exchange of ideas. Not a shouting match.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #1: Graduate student left aid-less
Author: Rupak Dua / Graduate Student / Biomed Engineering 
&nbsp;
I am from India and this is my first semester at FIU.  

I am the only international student in my department, and I have not gotten any support from my college or department. 

I've been told my Test of English as a Foreign Language scores did not get here on time. 

So when the department committee was reviewing my file, it was not complete, so I was left without any financial aid. 

In fact, I faxed the University twice, in December and January, to send them my scores. They didn't get through properly. 

In March, I got a letter from the graduate office that my TOEFL score hadn't reached them. 

I finally sent my score to the University over the phone before the deadline date.

So now the situation is that I have no support from the college or department. 

The acting chair of the department says that now all the funds have been committed, but there are grants. 

He said I could talk to the dean, but the dean says they allot a particular amount of grants to each department, and that it's the department who can help me out. 

So I am struck in between. Nobody is there to help me out of this weird situation and nobody is guiding me on what to do. 

I don't understand where I am wrong. I did all the formalities on time. So why is this an injustice to me?

Headline: Letter to the Editor #2: Student pays parking fee twice
Author: Arvi Arunachalam / Graduate Student / Finance
&nbsp;
I wish to bring to your kind attention the plight of doctoral students who are also instructors. 

Until Summer 2007, doctoral students who teach undergraduate classes were entitled to Faculty/Staff decals. 

Instead of paying the student decal fees for the year, we could get a staff decal, which is appropriate since almost all doctoral students teach classes, and finding parking during the semester is impossible. 

Starting in Fall 2007, the Department of Parking and Transportation has instituted a double tariff requiring instructors who are also enrolled as students (in my case, for dissertation credits) to pay twice - the student parking fees as well as the staff decal fee! 

This is an unjust, price-gouging tactic employed by the parking department. Think about the time and money lost by students waiting for an instructor who's late because of parking difficulties. In addition to the miserly doctoral stipends, double-charging for parking is a way that FIU mistreats doctoral students. 

I wish that Parking and Transportation offered a waiver to doctoral students to obtain staff decals, as they are a minuscule population and will not result in any loss of revenue. 

Parking already sells staff decals to any student who is willing to pay the extra price and ignobly charges even those who do not drive to pay for parking. 

FIU is the only school that penalizes students who walk or commute with a parking fee. Way to go for the green movement that's going on in other schools.

Headline: Letter to the Editor #3: Financial aid up to students
Author: Joe Vasquez / Alumnus, 2007 / Political Science 
&nbsp;
Let me first say, this is not high school. If you forget to turn in your homework your professor will not call your mother to remind you.

This is very much the situation when it comes to financial aid. We really need to stop complaining about problems we have created ourselves. 

Yes, financial aid has not always been on top of everything and I personally can attest to having problems with the office. 

But if you sit back and think about it, most of these problems are because I didn't do one thing or another. It is not the responsibility of the Office of Financial Aid to remind you of everything you need to do. After all, you're the one who wants financial aid, not them. 

If you wait until a week before classes to put all your paperwork together, of course you will run into problems - that's how life is. 

Let's start taking responsibility for our own lives and stop complaining about our self-created situation. 

Again, I'm not saying that financial aid couldn't be better organized or better staffed, but there are many ways we can take care of our matriculation issues. 

We can call the financial aid office, we can chat live online with a representative, or even just walk into the office. There are many ways to get what we need done. 

I recommend that if you want financial aid on time, you do your work on time - not one week before classes but at least two months prior.
