Headline: Men's basketball earns sloppy win in final exhibition game
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The men's basketball team concluded the preseason Nov. 15 with an 18-point win, defeating the Florida All-Stars 89-71 at the Golden Panther Arena. However, despite what the scoreboard read, head coach Donnie Marsh was displeased with his team's toughness and ball-handling, after the Golden Panthers committed 33 turnovers in the game.

"We've got to be tougher mentally. I thought physically we let them take some balls from us. We've just go to be tougher. If there's one thing that travels really fast in basketball circles, it's that if you're not a tough team, people are gonna come at you right away," Marsh said. "And I thought that was one of the things that a year ago we could hang our hat on. We were probably the toughest team in the Sun Belt [last year]...and we're gonna get there, but they just needed to see it and hear it that we're not there at this particular point...and we'll work on the course of these next few days to make sure we're there for that opener [on Nov. 21st]," Marsh added.

FIU was led by forward Junior Matias, who scored a game-high 26 points and had 12 rebounds. Marsh was pleased with the play of Matias, not only offensively, but defensively as well.

"I thought Junior Matias had a big night in a lot of ways for us. He did a really good job, took some charges for us, rebounded for us, scored some baskets, did a lot of good things," Marsh said.

FIU jumped out to a double-digit lead in the first half, but saw the margin cut to three at halftime.

"I was disappointed tonight. We had a 15-point lead in the first half, and let them come back and cut it to three at the end of the half. We didn't show enough toughness. We kind of let those guys with their maturity and their physical toughness take us out of what we wanted to do," Marsh said.

Despite the turnovers, FIU was able to pull away in the second half, shooting 18-of-29 (62 percent) from the field to regain the double-digit advantage. 

Center Byron Burnett continued to impress his coaches, shooting a perfect 5-for-5 from the field, finishing with 12 points, seven rebounds and five blocked shots.

"I was really pleased with Byron Burnett. I thought tonight Byron in just his second game at this level started to put the whole piece together and we are going to need him to do that if we are gonna go where we want to go this year," Marsh said.

Added Matias: "[Burnett's] gonna be really good. He's giving us something that we didn't have last year. He blocks a lot of shots and he helps the guards a lot so if [an opponent] gets to the basket, we're going to get our backs protected."

Guard Harry Lum was mainly responsible for the bulk of the FIU rebounding, hauling in 12 rebounds in the game.

"I thought Harry Lum rebounded very well for us," Marsh said. 

The Golden Panthers got solid contribution from its backcourt as well, as point guard Marcus Robinson (13 points) and shooting guard Carlos Morban (15 points) each scored in double digits.

However, the two guards combined for eight turnovers, something the team knows it needs to correct before this week's season opener.

"It's everybody's fault. It's not just one person. We were all just throwing the ball away and that's really not us," Robinson said. "But sometimes we just have those nights where we don't take care of the ball as much as we should, but we know we gotta do better next week against Howard...I'm not really too worried about it, you know, it's just one of those games," Robinson added.

But it might Robinson a little time to get used to playing point guard again, a position he hasn't played in years.

"This is really my first year playing the point since my junior year in high school, so I'm learning. The big thing I need to do is just run the offense more, get us into plays and just make sure everything's going smoothly and we'll be alright.

"[Robinson's] gonna have to be a cataylyst for us this year, but he's a kid I don't worry about because he's a gamer; he's a baller. He's gonna get in here and shoot 500 more shots and he'll be ready to go by Friday night. He's a tough kid," Marsh said.

But the team will need to avoid turnovers and continue its hot shooting in order to beat Howard.

"Everybody's ready to go and we're gonna be ready too. I don't have any doubt in my mind. We're gonna do big things this year and that's my word," Robinson said.

Headline: 10th - ranked men's soccer drops regular season finale
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers still can't beat the Gamecocks.

After failing to beat South Carolina in its four previous meetings, FIU made it five with a stunning 1-0 loss at home on Nov. 15.

With the loss, FIU saw its home-winning streak end at nine games and saw its record fall to 0-4-1 lifetime against the Gamecocks.

Although the Golden Panthers had already clinched the Atlantic Soccer Conference title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, they needed a win to secure home-field advantage and a possible first-round bye in the playoffs. But South Carolina needed a win just to get into the NCAA Tournament.

Neither team looked like it was going to get what it was looking for until the 78th minute when South Carolina sophomore Ryan Deter directed a corner kick into the goal with a header to give the Gamecocks a 1-0 lead.

"I couldn't see [the ball]. It was a really good corner and I couldn't get out to save it," said FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg.

However, despite allowing the late goal, it was Rosenberg who kept his team in the game with a number of brilliant saves in the first half.

"Roy was big time today. I can't really say much more about him. Everybody saw [what he did]. He was definitely one of our best players today," said midfielder Johnny Pulido.

Rosenberg was left alone on more than one occasion with an opposing attacker, as the FIU defense let the South Carolina forwards get behind them a few times in the first half, but Rosenberg managed to charge the ball and make a number of tough saves.

Added defender Zachary Peoples: "Roy definitely saved us tonight. It just seemed like [South Carolina] was coming from all different directions. We just couldn't get set. They pressured with everybody and we just had a lack in communication."

FIU had their offensive opportunities as well. 

In the 13th minute, midfielder Bobby Boswell received a pass from Pulido, but his shot from about 18 yards out sailed over the goal. Boswell had another chance in the 24th minute when the ball came loose right in front of the Gamecock net, but Boswell's point blank shot was deflected by USC goalkeeper Bradley Guzman.

"We both had our chances and they put one away and we couldn't. We couldn't hit the net. We missed a penalty kick and I give them a lot of credit. We just couldn't get it together today and they outplayed us," said Boswell.

FIU was awarded a penalty kick in the 40th minute when Pulido was taken down just inside the penalty box after a perfect through-ball by midfielder Oscar Gil.

But Pulido's penalty shot sailed to the upper left-hand side of the goal where it was saved by Guzman to preserve the scoreless tie entering the half.

In the 69th minute, FIU missed another scoring chance when midfielder Hendrix Emanuel sent a cross past the goalkeeper, but a streaking Carron Williams was a second too late getting to the ball and missed a chance at a definite goal.

After Deter's go-ahead goal in the 78th minute, FIU had one last chance to tie the game but Gil's shot from the right side in the 81st minute was easily saved by Guzman.

With the defeat, FIU fell to 13-4-2, but the team is still hopeful it will get a chance to play a game or two at home, where it was 9-2 this season.

"Hopefully we'll get a bye, but this game obviously didn't help. I think if we would have won, I think it would have been a totally different matter. I think we would have had a bye and probably been home for a couple of games, but this is going to hurt us a little bit," head coach Karl Kremser said.

The team will find out its draw on Nov. 17 on ESPNnews at 3 p.m.

Headline: Volleyball finishes regular season with two road losses
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The FIU volleyball team had a chance to clinch a spot in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament and finish the season over .500, but two straight road losses to Arkansas-Little Rock and Arkansas State put the team at 13-15 to conclude the regular season. The team must now wait for the result of the New Orleans-New Mexico State game. If New Orleans loses, the Golden Panthers will clinch the eighth and final Sun Belt Conference postseason berth and face the top-seeded New Mexico State on Nov. 20 in Western Kentucky.

Nov. 14- UALR 3, FIU 2

Betsy Moreland broke the school's all-time single-season assist record, but FIU fell to the Trojans 3-2 on Nov. 14 at Trojan Fieldhouse.

Moreland had 50 assists, giving her 1,242 on the season. She now needs only 57 more to break the FIU all-time assist record.

Despite Moreland's solid play, the Golden Panthers blew a 2-0 lead and lost the last three sets to fall to 13-14 on the season.

Arkansas-Little Rock won the game (26-30, 29-31, 30-19, 30-26, 16-14), outlasting FIU in the final set.

Ivana Kuzmic led the Trojans (18-10) with 25 kills and eight blocks while Ivana Vracar chipped in with 21 kills and a match-high 24 digs.

Julie Doan led FIU with 21 kills and seven blocks. Charlie Ball-Llovera had 16 kills and Elizabeth Baldwin had 20 digs.

Nov. 15- ASU 3, FIU 0

FIU's late season slide continued with a 3-0 loss to Arkansas State at the ASU Convocation Center on Nov. 15.

The Golden Panthers, who needed the game to clinch a spot in the Sun Belt Tournament, lost the match (30-25, 31-29, 30-19) and finished the regular season 4-10 in conference play.

Betsy Moreland led FIU with 27 assists and now needs only 30 more to break the school's all-time record.

Elizabeth Baldwin added 13 digs, but it wasn't enough as FIU fell to Arkansas State for the second time this season.

FIU jumped out to a quick 5-1 lead in the first game, but allowed the Indians to come back and take control of the match.

Gierdre Tarnauskaite led the Indians (21-10) with 17 kills in the match while hitting .467.

FIU must now hope for New Orleans to lose to New Mexico State on Nov. 16 in order to make the conference tournament. There is a good chance that could happen, as New Mexico State is in first place in the conference and New Orleans is in eighth.

Headline: Commentary: War comparisons should not be taken literally
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There is nothing more frustrating than people who cannot simply look at something in its appropriate context. Ultra high sensitivity has run rampant since the terrible attacks on our country that infamous September 2001 morning. 

But, two years and two months after what was the worst terrorist attack on American soil, people need to conceive the recently unconceivable notion that war is war - and as much as they would rather not - sports are sports. Period. 

University of Miami tight end Kellen Winslow II proceeded to refer to himself as a soldier in a war, and reminded members of the media "that's war out there." Why is everyone getting so bent out of shape? Media, fans, football players and even world renown chess players have been referring to sports, mostly football, as a "war" since I can remember, and probably before that too. 

Have wars not been going on before 9-11? All of a sudden people want to get patriotic and serious about the notion that sports and war may just be on a different level. No kidding. 

Grab a different microscope. See it in an alternate lighting. When I say trenches (referring to the battle between linemen) or the self proclaimed "Chosen One" that Winslow refers himself to or when he claims he is a "[expletive] soldier" do not throw a temper tantrum. You want to do that, then go protest downtown with those Free Trade people this week.

Winslow's comments weren't even race-related. Given the fact that he is African American it would have been OK. Heck, Charles Barkley said he hated white people. Funny. Dusty Baker said that blacks play better at night because they are less conducive to heat. No one cared. Rush Limbaugh is out of a job. The double standard in today's society is indisposed. Starting with media yuppies like myself. 

For generations, college and high school coaches have been using the metaphor that they are the "general" and their athletes are mere foot soldiers. They have every right to do so. That is their program, their show. 

Not like in pro sports where the head coach is just there to steer the ship and make sure that his million-dollar prima donna athletes stay the course. 

The college coach needs to find ways for his players to understand that when he is paying for your education, and maybe affording you the opportunity to become a spoiled pro, you need to do things his way. 

To Kellen Winslow that game on Nov. 8 against Tennessee was a war. Opponents, which are physically inferior, have no other way to tackle him than to go low and take out his knees. 

That is personal in the world he lives in. 

Remember, he is playing football at UM not because it is neat to get your school paid for to play a kid's game. 

He is playing football at UM because after this season, he wants to ride his Hummer H2 right into the NFL. It's his career.

If someone slashed your tires and prevented you from getting to work, smashed your calculator on the ground with a sledgehammer or did anything that prevented you from making a living, you'd be pretty teed off as well.

So Winslow had every right to call himself a soldier in the heat of the moment. 

He was not referring to fighting in the trenches of war; he was using he word to describe his competiveness on the football field. It makes no sense how people can take this statement literally, as if he was discrediting what the soldiers at war do.

This is our culture, our world. If you do not understand, you shouldn't be trying to draw parallels. 

We do not try to analyze the stock market, or interior decorate your home. Why bother coming around and telling us that sports are not a war. Duh. Thanks.

Headline: Football falls just short of first road victory in OT loss
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This time FIU coach Don Strock was not looking for any excuses. The second year coach was tired of giving excuses that cited his team's youthfulness and inexperience.

He is not buying into it any longer, after FIU's gut wrenching 22-19 overtime loss to Gardner-Webb in Boiling Springs, NC. Saturday afternoon. The Golden Panthers blew a nine-point fourth quarter lead before losing the game in the extra session.

"It's disheartening," Strock told the Miami Herald afterwards. "Instead of finding a way to win, we found a way to lose: fumbles, turnovers . . . I said turnovers would decide the game, and they did.

"So it's back to the drawing board. They played hard, but once again they didn't play real smart. That's about the way we've been playing all year.''

The season concludes next week with FAU coming to Pro Player Stadium, vying for a playoff spot. FIU (2-9) will try and salvage its season with perhaps spoiling the Owls' chance for a berth in the I-AA postseason tournament.

After GWU tied the score at the end of regulation 16-16, FIU kicker Adam Moss put the Panthers ahead with his fourth field goal of the day, a 22-yarder. Moss set a new FIU record, after coming into the game just 7-for-14. 

Then the Bulldogs had their chance in the overtime period. As customary, GWU began their drive from the opponents' 25-yard line. But an illegal procedure penalty backed GWU to the 30 of FIU. It didn't end up mattering as on the next play a pass from Nick Roberts to William Andres into the corner of the end zone beat cornerback Everett Baker for the game-winning touchdown. This marked the first time FIU had been involved in a game that went into overtime.

"We've got to find way to win. Right now, we're still finding ways to lose," Strock said. "We'll take a look at the film. I'm sure some guys played well and some guys need to step up to the plate. It's very disappointing, but it's another game on that learning curve and hopefully we'll learn from it."

FIU dominated for three quarters, including jumping out to a 10-0 lead to start the game. But they fell just short when they began to collapse late in the fourth quarter, damaging their chances to pick up the first-ever road win in school history. The Golden Panthers were up 16-13 with 5:42 in the fourth quarter after Chris Foster scored from one-yard out and a fake extra point attempt by GWU failed. 

FIU was unable to move the ball and gave the Bulldogs a second chance. 

But on second down, sophomore free safety Nick Turnbull intercepted Roberts and gave the ball back to the offense with a little over three minutes to play. The interception was FIU's fourth, as the Panthers held GWU to just 229 yards of offense in the games first three quarters.

FIU's offense also had a stellar day, gaining 426 yards. Redshirt freshman quarterback Josh Padrick became the first FIU passer to throw for 2,000 yards with his 20-for-37, 324-yard performance.

It all went for naught once GWU was able to tie the game after Adam Gorman, while gaining 118 yards on 24 carries, fumbled the ball on a five-yard run with three minutes to go.

GWU drove all the way down the FIU six after getting the ball on the FIU 46. 

On second down, Turnbull stripped Andres of what would have been the game-winning touchdown in regulation. And on third down, defensive tackle Pedro Farias deflected Roberts' pass at the line of scrimmage.

Bulldogs kicker Hunter Smith nailed a 21-yard field goal to send the game into overtime.

FIU wide receiver Cory McKinney scored the Panthers' lone touchdown, which came in the first quarter. Padrick hooked up with McKinney for the 15-yard score.

Foster, who rushed for 101 yards on 23 carries added a pair of one-yard touchdown runs for the Bulldogs.

Headline: FIU-FAU Preview- Shula Bowl II
Subheadline: Running back Adam Gorman has averaged one touchdown and 107 yards over his past six games. Can he, along with quarterback Josh Padrick and crew spoil FAU's playoff hopes?
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The entire season is not all lost for FIU. Yes, they have a disappointing 2-9 record and always find ways to lose games, but this team can still end the season bitter-sweet with a victory over in-state rival and 15th- ranked Florida Atlantic University.

The rivalry began last year between these two teams in FIU's inaugural season and one year into the FAU program. 

Last season, FAU dominated early and never lost the lead as they defeated FIU 31-21. The Owls finished last season 2-9 and FIU 5-6. 

This season the tables have turned. The Golden Panthers are now 2-9, and FAU stands at an impressive 8-2.

Winning the game comes with two incentives for both teams; one is winning the Shula Bowl and second is winning the recruiting battle in South Florida.

"We are going to go over our game plan and work out our things. This last game is the game we are judging our season by and everyone wants to see where we are at against FAU. That's our big rivalry and everyone wants to hold that big Don Shula trophy," said free safety Nick Turnbull, who thinks ending the season with a victory will be a lot sweeter for the team.

Offensive lineman Mike Alvarez believes that winning the game will give FIU the edge in recruiting top players.

"Winning is a major victory because it's a big recruiting tool to get to bring in guys who can play. A lot of emotions go down in that game because it will also be our last," said Alvarez.

Kicker Adam Moss believes FIU is talented enough to notch out a victory against the Owls.

"I can't wait; it's always fun kicking in big games like that. I will try to do the same thing I did in this game [against Garner Webb] and just do my job. It will be real big for us to get a victory because they have a good team, but we also have talented players and I think we can beat them," said Moss, who became the first kicker in FIU history to record four field goals in a game last week. This game will also be the first against FAU for quarterback Josh Padrick and receiver Chandler Williams. Both have contributed to this year's team despite being freshman.

"They have got a really good team but with a lot of preparation and studying film, it could be a good game for us," said Padrick, who became the first 2,000-yard passer in school history with 324 against Garner Webb in only his 10th game.

But FIU will need to hold on to the ball and execute to win the game.

"I think that the key is to execute everything coach tells us. The defense has to do what they do and we got to do what we do to win," Williams said.

FAU comes to town riding a five-game winning streak after a 51-3 rout of Siena. FIU returns home from a 22-19 loss to Garner Webb, a team FAU defeated 31-26.

The Golden Panther defense will have its  hands full covering Anthony Crissinger-Hill, who leads the team with 50 catches for 770 yards and eight touchdowns. 

FAU Quarterback Jared Allen has thrown for 2012 yards 17 touchdowns. 

Leading the Owls on defense is redshirt freshman Quincy Skinner, who leads the team with four interceptions this season.

Recently, FAU announced its plans to join Division I-A football next season. 

FIU hopes to soon make the same jump, but knows the game against FAU will provide a key measuring stick as to where FIU stands.

The game will take place this Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at "The Cage".

Beware of misleading petitioners: FIU at stake

To the Editor:
This afternoon I stopped to listen to a request for my signature on a petition to change Florida's constitution. The gentleman's sunburned face and weary demeanor generated an unusual pity, so I read his petition.

The petition's language is benign, more or less barring a person from holding public office in Florida if she violates her oath "by refusing to carry out, or attempting to impede implementation of any provision of the Florida constitution." The penalty for transgression is forfeiture of office.

Sounds good so far, right? The problem is that signing such a petition could be devastating to FIU. How so? There are two constitutional provisions in particular that have been delayed in their implementation because of serious budget questions.

The first is a proposal for high-speed rail and the second is related to reducing K-12 class sizes. If implemented together, Florida would be required to raise taxes and fees to cover the multi-billion dollar would-be cost.

University tuition and general revenue support by the legislature would very likely be affected if this petition were placed on the ballot and passed. Universities are heavily subsidized by the legislature and historically have taken a financial hit when the budget is unbalanced.

So, before you sign that petition to help the poor canvasser make his money, think about why you are being asked to sign and graciously refuse.

Reader response to Diaz' pro-abortion column

To the Editor: 
I see that somehow Andy Diaz is once again spewing his atheistic venom on the pages of the once respectable Opinion section. 

I rarely read an entire column by my dear cousin partly because I am a simple man who cannot understand his syllabically-profuse language and mostly because it only takes a glance to realize that his columns and choice of words are merely his way of proving how superior he is to the rest of the human race. 

Anyway, rather than proceed with an ad-homonym attack, I would rather briefly respond to his recent column, "Bush's ban on partial birth abortion misinformed."

Andy's use of the word "pre-human" to describe a pre-born infant is not only offensive but logically fallacious. 

This term implies that two (preferably married) humans came together to produce some being that has human DNA but is somehow not human. 

Not having the time to engage in a metaphysical argument, I will simply say that a hypocrisy is present where Andy would probably not choose to have a pair of large scissors jammed into his brain stem and then have his skull crushed, but would then allow a potential mother to make that choice for her child.

Of course, the issue of a woman's health is always the quickest to be brought up. 

Once again, not having room to engage in a full debate, I will simply state that for a woman to choose her life over her child's is not only extremely selfish but unnatural in the animal world. 

If she should indeed die, then the joy of dying for her child should be enough to bring her peace in her heroic act. 

Giana Beretta Molla made that choice in 1962 and was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church for her courage in fulfilling the natural law.

Therefore, I conclude this letter by pointing out that the anti-life we're in is precisely because of the artificial means of avoiding the natural purpose of the sexual act. 

This so-called regulation of life has only opened up Pandora's Box when it comes to how we treat human life.

I sum up my point, I encourage all you pre-born children out there to use your stem cells before someone else does!

Headline: Athletic Department needs plan before fee increase
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
A potential athletics fee increase is on the horizon, and what Athletic Director Rick Mello is calling a "calculated risk" sounds like a bad bet for students.

The increase, $1.21 per credit hour in addition to the  $8.45 students pay already, would be used primarily to add scholarships to the athletics program, a requisite for declaring intent for a Division I-A football program, the elite division of collegiate athletics. FIU football is currently a Division I-AA program - one rung down from the top tier.

According to Mello, the decision needs to be made soon because the changing face of collegiate athletics will make the transition more difficult in the future.

Presently, an athletic program looking to secure a Division I-A football program must reach three major goals: First, it must provide 200 athletic scholarships (not limited to football), it must schedule five games against Division I-A opponents, and it must have an average attendance of 15,000 for its home games.

While it's conceivable that FIU might comply with the first two requirements - indeed the fee increase, which would generate upwards of a million dollars for athletic scholarships, would have us meet the first requirement - the last requirement, the attendance requirement, is what makes FIU's chances of attaining Division I-A status tenuous.  

They would need to virtually sell out every game (FIU Community Stadium seats some 17,000) in order to achieve the required 15,000-attendee-a-game average.

The attendance for the last home game? 3,512, against Jacksonville.

While athletics has been perfectly happy to ask students, who have already faced troublesome tuition increases, for yet another increase in fees that would generate more than a million dollars for their purposes, they have yet to present a plan that would "put butts in the seats," as it were. That's a lot of money to ask with so shoddy a plan.

And it begs the question, if interest in football is so low, should Division I-A be such a high priority?

In the meantime, for those who missed the chance at University Park, the Athletic Department will try to make their case at Biscayne Bay Campus on Nov. 19.

It will be interesting to see if they have better answers this time around.

Headline: File-sharing is the moral equivalent of stealing a car
Author: Chris Collins/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
By Chris Collins

Knight Ridder Tribune



The Recording Industry Association of America's official moralists: Illegally downloading copyrighted material off the Internet for free is wrong.

The collective opinion of 60 million Americans: Whatever. And that's how it goes. Millions balk at the moneymaking moral imperative that lawyers of the RIAA righteously proclaim. 

But, as a student - not as a record-label CEO - I agree with them. And starting Wednesday, we'll have another reason to acquire music legally: 

Napster, the former bastion of online file-sharing, is expected to reopen for business, charging a small fee for downloading tunes.

Online file-sharing is a bad habit I kicked about half a year ago. I used to download regularly - in the mornings, after lunch, at night, while I was sleeping. All the while, my trusty dorm laptop would be sucking dry the college bandwidth with pieces by U2, Creed and other artists. 

Finally, I began to lose interest. And I realized I was wrong. America needs a reality check on this issue. There's a reason online file-sharing is illegal, but file-sharers have crafted elaborate excuses for continuing the 4-year-old practice. They say it's just like copying off the radio, or that music prices are exorbitant anyway. 

A recent Gallup poll shows that only 18 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds considered cheating on a test morally acceptable. However, 83 percent of those same teens did not have a problem with downloading music for free. 

A practical, no-nonsense look at the issue, however, reveals that file-sharing is as morally shortsighted as cheating on a test or stealing a car. 

First, music and other copyrighted material is private property. Like a car or a perfect score on a final exam, it's something we work to create, purchase or achieve. It belongs to someone. Similarly, the creative value of music must be respected in the same way. 

With more than 230 million copies of KaZaA - the lead online file-sharing program -- downloaded worldwide, file-sharing is clearly mass dissemination of copyrighted material and, therefore, an infringement on private property. 

Technically, it's just Martha from Montana sharing a country tune with Walt from Washington. But realistically, it's giving away something for nothing when millions are sharing with millions. That's why it's illegal.

Luckily, with Napster's recent reopening, there's a legal way to avoid pricey music purchases. 

The new Napster, however, will offer users 500,000 music downloads for only 99 cents a song or $9.95 per album. Though far from free, Napster 2.0 is definitely legal and definitely not a strain on the conscience. 

After the RIAA sued 261 online file-sharers in early September, traditional file-sharing programs such as KaZaA and iMesh have seen their numbers drop considerably. 

Meanwhile, traffic on Web sites that offer music downloads for a fee has increased dramatically. For-fee services like Buymusic.com and Rhapsody, which is owned by Seattle-based RealNetworks Inc., both report a dramatic increase in users since the September lawsuits. This new trend isn't so bad. 

For too long, shaky reasoning has been used to justify online file-sharing. All the arguments fall short when faced with practical reality. 

The RIAA lawyers may not be pillars of moral clarity, but they're right on this one.

Headline: Video games encourage racism, violence
Author: Yasmine Abellard/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
"I hate these Haitians!" 

"Take my boys over there and then we'll take these Haitians down!"

"Stinking nest of Haitians, we gonna kill 'em all!"

These were the phrases uttered and aimed at characters portraying Haitian drug dealers in several game scenes in the year's most popular, violently graphic, and best selling video game, "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City."

Mexicans and Cubans are just some of the ethnic groups in the video game that did not receive the most positive comments, to say the very least. As I watched the video clip presented by CBS 2 Reports, a CBS affiliate in New York, condemning Rockstar Games, the creators of "Grand Theft Auto," for allowing racial statements in "Vice City," I chuckled rather than let fumes of anger overtake me. 

As I have lived in South Florida for close to 15 years, the truth is I was not surprised at the idea of my ethnic group being targeted or dehumanized as the butt of racist comments because it was nothing new to me. Nevertheless, I wondered if this ethnic bashing, which these days are common in several video games, influenced a game player's view of a particular ethnic group, and evoked racist beliefs towards these groups. 

Although there are mixed reviews about the game, for the most part, "Vice City" is portrayed as an entertaining game embodying glamour, power and corruption in the world of drug operations. 

Michel Apaid, a sophomore and business management major says, "The whole aspect of controlling someone and doing what you want, that's why I enjoy it, not the comments that are in it." 

Apaid, who is Haitian and plays video games on a daily basis, does not believe that the comments are intended to promote hate against Haitians in general, although he does not defend the game's choice of words in reference to certain ethnic groups. 

"It's a game directed to you, insulting your enemies, and a group of Haitians at some point in the game is the enemy...it's a specific group of Haitians that are gangsters in the game that he's referring to."

Apaid says that he does not doubt that someone could develop a negative perception of Haitians from playing this game. 

"In the society we live today, I would not be surprised if someone developed a hate towards Haitians, but you would have to have a very sensitive mind," he says.

However, he argues that "any adult eighteen and over who has a rational sense of thinking will understand that this is another form of entertainment."

Dr. Oren Stier, an assistant professor of religious studies and the associate director for Judaic Studies, is not shocked by the idea of dehumanizing or exterminating ethnic groups in video games such as "Vice City," is for the most part viewed as being normal.   

"Obviously it's seen as entertainment. It's marketed as entertainment. It sells as entertainment. I assume it's successful because it works as entertainment," he says.

"Vice City' is rated "M" for mature audiences and is not marketed for persons under the age of 18. Dr. Stier says that anyone, regardless of age, can be influenced over time by games promoting the extermination of ethnic groups. 

He says, "I think that as people continue to play games like this, it does affect their broader world view; I don't see how it wouldn't."

Iris Bedoya, a freshmen and criminal justice major, admits that she was taken aback when she learned of the game's statements concerning killing Haitians in Vice City. 

The Ecuadorian-American who prefers playing video games of the sporting genre, felt that the statements had an underlined purpose. 

Bedoya says, "I think that there's a little bit of racism because they're not saying 'kill the Haitian drug dealers,' they say 'kill all the Haitians.'" 

Bedoya also thinks that if the targeted ethnic groups were different, it would have caused more of a controversy. Nevertheless, she believes that as long as "you have a strong head, and think to yourself 'It's just a game, this isn't something to take seriously,' [then] I think most people can play it and they'll be fine."

Had the game's dialogue in the same context been "I hate these Jews," "Take my boys over there, and then we'll take these Americans down," or "Stinking nest of Africans, we gonna kill 'em all," perhaps the line between virtual reality and racism, as well as genocide, would then be taken into consideration. 

"Grand Theft Auto," having successfully incorporated seductive racism into the gameplay, may not be a long shot from moving into the ranks of games such as "Ethnic Cleansing," in which the object of the game is to kill gangs of Blacks, Latinos and Jews in a fictional city modeled after New York.

Dr. Stier says he's "not surprised that there are video games that simulate genocide now, because where do you go after you get tired of killing the cops and the prostitutes? You have to make it bigger and better."  

Since "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" has sold well over 8.5 million copies worldwide, I suppose it is normal to expect online resource sites for online gaming to have users posting  "doing a 'stoppy' and shooting dirty ass Haitians at the same time," as their "best gaming moment."

But like they say - it's just a game.

Headline: Survey finds college students increasingly leaning right
Author: Jeff Zeleny/Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Growing up, the politics in the household of Steven Druckenmiller had always leaned toward the liberal side. So when the 20-year-old goes home, he takes delight wearing a shirt from his College Republican club.

At Capital University here, Druckenmiller and several dozen others regularly hold meetings to discuss tax policy, free trade and other conservative bedrocks. Membership in the rival Democratic group, meanwhile, has dwindled to two. 

"Sure," the college junior said with a smile, "some of us have liberal parents and are rebelling."

Druckenmiller and his friends represent a growing trend of college students who are identifying with the Republican Party.

 Gone are the days when college campuses were liberal strongholds, awash only in principles of the Democratic Party.

A new poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University showed that 31 percent of college students across the country identify themselves as Republicans. 

The poll also showed that 61 percent of college students approve of President Bush's job performance, which is about 8 percentage points higher than the general public.

At the same time, 27 percent of the students say they are Democrats. And 38 percent say they are independent or unaffiliated, which makes them ripe targets for presidential candidates who are paying careful attention to the youngest segment of the electorate, particularly the nation's 9 million college students.

"The days are over of colleges being a bastion of Democratic politics," said Dan Glickman, director of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "We've had 20 years without much radicalism on campuses around the country. The campuses now reflect more of the country as a whole."

He added: "This group ought to be mined by the candidates. If they don't, it's at their own peril."

In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan's presidency inspired a generation of conservatives on college campuses. GOP strategists hope to re-create and expand that movement and are turning to college-age Republicans like Druckenmiller who were barely born when Reagan took office.

It was here in Columbus, in fact, where the television sitcom "Family Ties" was mythically staged from 1982 to 1989, as Michael J. 

Fox's college-age character of Alex P. Keaton worshiped Reagan, much to the dismay of his hippie parents. That show, which Druckenmiller watched in reruns, first inspired his political thought.

So when Bush came to downtown Columbus last Thursday, the junior economics and philosophy major from Fremont, Ohio, stood on a street corner for nearly two hours to show his support for Bush. Wearing a College Republican sweatshirt and holding a bullhorn with his right hand, Druckenmiller marshaled more than a dozen young conservatives through a thicket of Democratic protesters.

"We are a new wave coming in!" he said in an interview, stepping away from the demonstration for a moment. "It's a blend of Arnold Schwarzenegger-esque conservatism."

Indeed, the Republican Party hopes to capitalize on the energy and interest created last month by the bodybuilder/actor's election as California governor. And like Schwarzenegger, polls show that younger Republicans are more likely to support moderate positions on issues like abortion and gay rights.

To be sure, the Democratic Party is not ceding the young vote. Last week in Washington, nearly 4,000 young professionals danced to hip-hop music at a fund-raiser led by former President Bill Clinton.

In a quest to build its own new generation of supporters, the party is concentrating on one message for college students: Jobs. The Democratic presidential candidates will focus on the economy and other issues Tuesday night in Boston at "America Rocks the Vote," a CNN debate where young voters will quiz the candidates for 90 minutes.

"We've got to have young people understand why this election is so critical," Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe said. "Right now, 7 out of 10 college graduates cannot get a job this year. They've got to understand the issues. If they don't, that's our fault."

Since 1999, though, the College Republican National Committee has tripled its membership and now has 1,150 chapters and more than 1,000 student coordinators on campuses nationwide. The Democratic Party, McAuliffe conceded, has not been as aggressive as the individual presidential campaigns. 

Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who has surged to the front of the field of nine Democratic candidates, launched a tour of college tour campuses this fall through his "Generation Dean" program. 

His is the only campaign with student organizations on virtually every major campus in America. 

In the Harvard poll conducted late last month, more than two-thirds of the students said they were registered to vote and 82 percent said they would definitely or probably vote in the 2004 presidential election. History, though, suggests those numbers might be optimistic as apathy toward politics among youth has grown in the last three decades. 

In the 2000 election, for example, only 29 percent of eligible voters from ages 18 to 24 cast ballots for president. By comparison, more than 45 percent of young voters cast ballots in the 1968 election, as controversy raged over the Vietnam War. 

In next year's election, though, strategists from both parties are predicting a higher turnout than the 2000 election. A competitive Democratic primary, in addition to concerns over the war in Iraq and the economy, could stir more interest.

For the future of both political parties, the stakes are high, as some of these voters are casting ballots for the first time.

"They are much more open-minded," Glickman said. "But once you're a Republican or a Democrat, you tend to stay there."

Headline: Pi Kappa Phi honors brothers' achievements
Author: David Perez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Pi Kappa Phi hosted its second Faculty Mixer Wednesday, Nov. 11 at 6:30 p.m. in the Faculty Club, to honor the brothers who have achieved academic success, along with fostering a relationship with professors outside the classroom environment.

Felix Gil, a junior international business major and the fraternity's scholarship chair, coordinated the event with the help of Pi Kappa Phi president, Alex Madrigal, and Alpha Xi Delta Pan-Hellenic delegate Christine Denton. 

The aim of the Faculty Mixer, according to Gil, was to "end the misconceptions of fraternities."

Pi Kappa Phi President and MIS senior Alex Madrigal wants to disassociate the negative stereotype of fraternities. Madrigal believes he can do this by "fostering relationships with faculty" through mixers and their Empathy Training Dinner, which was held on Nov. 8.

The Faculty Mixer was centered around the awards ceremony recognizing the academic achievements of the brothers at the 3.0 to 3.49 level called the Gold award, in which there were 11 recipients and the 3.5 to 4.0 level Blue & Gold award, which had four. A special award for the brother with the highest grade point average was given to Richard Helguera, who had a 3.8.   

The evening was also an opportunity to meet with professors as well as school and government leaders in a relaxed environment.  

Coral Gables Mayor Don Slesnick, a Pi Kappa Phi brother from the University of Virginia, said that being part of the fraternity helps train young people to be part of society. 

"[Fraternity life] taught me about human relations. I look forward to giving advice and council to the brothers interning with [me] at city hall," said Slesnick, a Pi Kapp for 41 years.  

FIU Provost Mark Rosenberg stressed that "part of discipline is who you associate with" and later made references to how he enjoyed working with University Park Student Government President Clayton Solomon and Pi Kappa Phi.  Rosenberg's message to the freshmen was to "find a mentor who is successful."

Pete E.C. Markowitz, an FIU physics professor since 1995, insisted that FIU has reached an incredible size and should continue traditions as solid as as this one. 

A huge supporter of the FIU football team, Markowitz said he enjoys the environment at FIU much more than what he sees at the University of Miami.

As Rosenberg left the Faculty Club he advised the brothers to "stay away from these Faculty Club M&Ms."

Headline: Miss FIU winner to compete in Miss Florida Pageant
Author: Asra Jawaid/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU held its first ever Miss FIU pageant for a crowd of nearly 100 spectators, many of whom were faculty and students, last Saturday night in the Graham Center ballrooms. 

"We're really excited to have FIU join other [Florida] universities in sending representatives to the Miss Florida pageant," said Kristi Saunig, secretary of the Miss Florida pageant and an FIU alumnus. 

The show was hosted by senior Megan Along. 

The judges evaluated 11 different candidates in four different areas: an interview conducted on the afternoon of the pageant (40 percent of final score), performing a talent (30 percent), the lifestyle and fitness competition, better known to some as the swimsuit contest (10 percent) and the presence and poise competition (10 percent). 

The final 10 percent is a composite score reflecting the candidate's holistic image. For the talent competition, most contestants chose to either dance, sing or sometimes both. 

There were a few exceptions to this rule. Marissa Amkraut, for example, played the violin and Erica Barrios chose to recite a poem she wrote herself. 

After all four portions of the competition took place, Amkraut was crowned Miss FIU. 

She received a $500 scholarship courtesy of FIU, as well as a crown, an official trophy, a floral bouquet, and gift certificates from Ann Marie's ($200) and Regalia ($250). 

The three runners up - Maite Maguregui (1st runner up), Chrissie Fit (2nd runner up) and Evelyn Danford (3rd runner up)- each received smaller sums of money  ($250, $150 and $100 respectively) as well as an official trophy and a bouquet of flowers.  The scholarship money is strictly for educational purposes such as paying for classes or buying books, Along said. 

  In addition to the crowning of Miss FIU and prizes for her and the three runners up, the Miss FIU talent award, Miss Congeniality award and the Thomas B. Jelke Interview award were also given. 

Next June, Amkraut will travel to St. Petersburg, Florida to compete against forty or fifty other female Floridians for the title of Miss Florida. 

The Thomas B. Jelke Interview Award and Miss FIU Award were also presented to Amkraut, the new Miss FIU. Robyn Luck won the Miss Congeniality Award. 

The recipient of this award was decided by the contestants themselves. 

In order to compete for the title of Miss FIU, contestants must be registered students between the ages of 17 and 24 and must have a platform. 

A platform is a cause for which the contestant works and would promote if she was crowned Miss FIU. 

For instance, Amkraut's platform was an organization known as "Growing Up Complete."

"It's an organization that strives to infuse arts education across the curriculum to make learning more exciting for students," she said.

The requirements are the same for Miss Florida, Along said.

This was not the first pageant for some of this year's contestants. 

Junior Evelyn Danford also participated in the Miss South Florica Coast pageant.

"It's good that we can have this kind of thing so we can be represented at the state pageant." 

The Miss FIU pageant was a new experience for Luck.

"It's a challenge because it's not just about looking good. You have to be able to speak in front of an audience and carry yourself," said Luck, who won the Miss Congeniality award.

Raffle tickets were sold during intermission and a winner was selected after the pageant winners were announced. 

Half of the $124 raised through this raffle was given to the lucky person whose ticket number was selected and the other half was donated to the Miss FIU scholarship fund.

Headline: Athletics requests fee increase
Author: Vanessa Gomez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's Athletic Department convened a meeting on Nov. 12 with the purpose of persuading students to approve a proposed athletic fee increase. Athletic Director Rick Mello conducted the meeting, and explained in detail what the increase will mean to students as well as FIU's football team.

If approved, the fee increase will be for the amount of  $1.21, which is the maximum that a fee of this kind can be increased per year based on state statute. 

Currently, the athletic fee is $8.45 per credit hour; from this amount $1.25 goes to our football program. If the increase is voted through, students will be paying $9.66 per credit hour worth of athletic fees, of which $2.46 will be used to fund our football program.

 According to Mello, the request for the fee increase comes at a crucial time in college football. 

 "There are two things that are happening in college athletics that basically has completely changed the landscape from years ago," said Mello, "One is conference realignment; the other is change in NCAA standards for 1-A qualifications."

According to a recently issued Athletics press release, the Sun Belt Conference has offered an opportunity to FIU (and it is seriously considering FAU) to enter the conference in 1-A football if we declare our intent by June 2004. 

 The Sun Belt has accelerated its timing because of the conference realignment and because the NCAA requirement stipulates that a conference must have eight members playing 1-A football and all sports in order to be viable. 

If FIU opts to go1-A  at this time, the window of opportunity may not be opened for a long time as schedules in football are made years ahead and there is no way that we could meet the requirements of five 1-A home games without  a conference.

 "I did not in any way envision being in front of you this soon in the maturation process, as far as the football program is concerned..." said Mello,  "but if we are going to move we have to move now, because the shelf life of conference realignment is usually once every fifteen years."

The 1-A division includes schools such as University of Miami, Florida State University, and University of South Florida. Mello defended what going 1-A would meant to FIU. 

 "When you look at the purpose of the request there is absolutely no question it has been measured and documented as far as external exposure and notoriety for the institution. 

"We also feel that in the competitiveness of our marketplace, down the road for students to be interested, number one, we have to win games, and eventually that is going to happen. And number two, be combined with other major universities in the state," said Mello.

The fee increase will generate a total of $785,000 in the first year, starting in fall 2004, of which $750,000 will go towards scholarships and the remaining $35,000 will be used for operational costs. 

The next full academic year, starting in the summer 2005, the revenue from the increased fee is expected to be as high as $1 million. The Athletic Department has another meeting scheduled for Nov. 19 at the Biscayne Bay Campus, where students will once again have an opportunity to express their opinion on the subject. 

On Nov. 20, the fee committee will convene to finally decide on the matter. According to Florida statutes, "An increase in the athletic fee may occur only once each fiscal year and must be implemented beginning with the fall term." 

It goes on to state that, "the recommemdations of the committee shall take effect only after approval by the university president, after consultation with the student body president, with final approval by the university board of trustees."

Chuck Tinder, associate vice president of budget and planning and chair of fee committee said, "The committee will not vote on the increase until they've heard from the students and people who will actually be paying this fee."

The NCAA regulations require all 1-A institutions to offer 200 full scholarships for all sports. 

Because of these regulations, if FIU joins division 1-A, other sports will see a slight increase in the amount of scholarships they can offer.

 Although football will directly benefit from the fee increase, the jump to division 1-A will increase the amount of scholarships other sports are required to grant.

"If the decision is not made to go 1-A, and the fee is passed, as it was indicated in the fee committee, it would be our recommendation that the money revert back to the student government for student programs," Mello said. 

As the floor opened up for questions, Ron Hollis, UP Student Government Council vice president, wondered if any of the monies will be allocated for a stadium. 

 "You cannot use fee income for a stadium. All that has to be done with private dollars. We have prospects out there, and now we are hoping to have donors; maybe a joint effort with the county," said Mello.  

Junior and Panther Rage president, Shaun Alcindor stated, "Another requirement of NCAA rules is that you must have 15,000 fans in the seats, a requirement we haven't met yet." Mello responded, 

"That is a calculated risk FIU is taking. If we waited until 15,000 fans got here, and we don't declare now then we are kept out and they [NCAA] change the rules then it's going to be much tougher to get in [to Division 1-A]. If we are going to play 1-A we are going to have to do more to get people in the stands."

A question was asked regarding the soccer program. Mello said that the program was still under evaluation.

"Never in our history have football funds or soccer funds been co-mingled. The football fund is completely separate from other sports," Mello said.

Mello stressed the importance of football to university life and economics. 

"We feel football is very important," said Mello. "We added football, number one, for campus life, number two, to use it as a mechanism to attract alumni back to the institution and number three, for exposure of the university and lastly, to attract friends and business community to the university. 

"So far, we've been pretty successful in all of those, but like everything else we are going to grow, we are going to get better and better," Mello said.

Housing Shuttle Bus

Student Government Council President Nicaise Parillon discussed the BBC housing shuttle bus, which is supposed to take students to Publix and to Dolphin Mall, but the bus is only going to the mall and is not running at convenient hours.

Parillon said that she has arranged for this problem to be corrected and encourages students to take advantage of the service provided every Friday and Sunday. The shuttle is currently supplied as a test to decide whether students will use it often.

SAF Cards

The council obtained SAF Cards to give to students. The cards are composed of two drug test strips and are an aid in attempting to identify the presence of illicit drugs in beverages by placing drops of the drink on the strips and observing if the strips turn a different color. If it does, this indicates that a possible date rape drug is present.

Athletic Fee Increase

President Nicaise Parillon encouraged students to attend the Nov. 19 hearing at 3:30 p.m. in the Panther Square and get informed about the possible fee increase, even if they are not against the increase, stressing the need to understand the reasons for the increase.

Cafeteria Evalution

Vice President Ruth-Allyson Webster said that she and other council members went to the BBC cafeteria on Nov. 6 and found it to be below average.

Webster described the faculty seating section as resembling a "clinic" due to the curtain separating it from the rest of the cafeteria seating area. Webster said the section was unattractive and students noted that it made professors seem very unapproachable.

Nicholas Diciacco, Facilities Management's executive director of Business and Finance, had the curtain removed. Webster said that Diciacco spoke about groundbreaking for a new food court in March 2004.

Headline: FIU student dies in car accident
Author: Maria Merzeau/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Donald Pernudi, Jr., an FIU student, died Nov. 9, in a car accident in Coral Gables. He was 23. 

The accident happened about 3 a.m. along the 3500 block of Alhambra Circle. Pernudi, was riding in the back seat of a gray Honda Accord, when the driver lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a tree. The driver of the car, Victor Victorero, 26, and the front seat passenger, Margaret Pajak, 22, were airlifted to Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Their conditions are unknown. The back seat passengers, Pernudi, and Justin Dalziel, 23, died instantly in the crash.

Pernudi's funeral service and burial was held last Friday and Saturday. According to his friends, more than one hundred people attended. 

Paula Saldarriaga, an international business and marketing major, and Pernudi's best friend said that the day of the accident he went out to a Coconut Grove Club to celebrate his good grade on a finance test.

Pernudi was born in Los Angeles, and was raised in Miami. Most recently, he resided in West Kendall with his parents, who are from Nicaragua, and his 11-year-old sister.

He is survived by his mother Cleo Pernudi, his father Donald Pernudi, and his sister Kimberly Pernudi.

''He was a good son, he would always put his family first,'' Saldarriaga said.

Pernudi was a junior and an international business and marketing major, who transferred from Miami-Dade College to FIU this summer. He went to school full time and held a part time job at Best Buy for the past six years. 

According to Saldarriaga, his future plans included finishing school and going to Law School.Pernudi also liked being at FIU.  

''He became such a hard worker; every time I would go to the library, I would see him studying,'' Ernesto Quezada, a junior and Biology major, said. ''He had good grades at school. ''  

According to his friends, Pernudi was always there for him. He was a very respectful, responsible, and friendly person, they said.

"Pernudi was my best friend, I couldn't ask for more; he was an angel,'' Jimmy Quezada, an MDC student said.

He was also a very positive person, his friends said. 

''He always had a smile on his face,'' said freshman Rachael Somerstein.

'' He had a big heart. He'll lift you up when you were down,'' Saldarriaga said. 

In his spare time, he liked hanging out with his friends. Also going out to clubs with friends, renting a movie, or listening to hip-hop and R & B music. Also, he loved sports, especially baseball and the L.A Dodgers. He also had a passion for cars, particularly the Toyota Supra. Pernudi's memory is cherished by his family and friends.

Headline: Muslim Student Association hosts Ramadan Fast-A-Thon
Author: Yasmine Abellard/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Muslim Students Association invites everyone to its  Ramadan Fast-a-Thon hosted at the Graham Center Ballroom on Nov. 20 at 5:30 p.m.

The purpose of the Fast-a-Thon is to promote awareness of hunger in local communities by raising money through area businesses and donating the funds to a local food bank. 

This year's Fast-a-Thon funds will go to the Daily Bread Food Bank. 

For every non-Muslim student who pledges to fast for one day (from sunrise to sunset) on Nov. 20, a local business will donate one dollar to the Daily Bread Food Bank. 

That dollar is able to provide for six meals for an individual.

 Students will then meet at sunset (approximately 5:30 p.m.) in the GC Ballroom to break the fast with dishes from different Islamic cultures. 

This event, organized by the Muslim Students Association at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville two years ago, has now spread throughout campuses across the U.S. and Canada with the help of its parent organization, the Muslim Students Association of U.S. and Canada (MSA National).

Danielle Johnston, a development officer for the Daily Bread Food Bank in Miami, says that people have a stereotypical view of who suffers from hunger: tenants unable to afford their rent, single mothers, elderly people or even college students.

"The misconception is that those that need food are homeless and addicts. We serve people who can't make ends meet," Johnston said. 

According to a press release from MSA National, over 20 million people in the United States suffer from hunger, and a high percentage of that population includes children. MSA National reports that close to 8% of households in the United States are at risk.

Johnston, who first learned of the Fast-a-Thon through one done by the University of Miami last year, said that four other universities are working with them this year. 

Aside from providing food and groceries, Fast-a-Thon also help shelters, daycares, and anybody who needs the help. 

MSA Vice President, Nour Kablawi, would like fasters to see this Fast-a-Thon as more than just a time to starve yourself. Kablawi hopes that students will empathize with those who suffer from hunger and poverty. 

"I want people to look at different parts of the world [and] look within the United States, [to] see how people are going through their lives, and how easy we have it and how we should appreciate what we have," Kablawi said.

An MSA member for three years, Kablawi said that being part of such an organization has taught her several things. 

"I learned about the importance of trying to educate people. You have a lot of people who are very ignorant about so many things, and it's not because they want to be ignorant; it's just that they don't know any better," Kablawi said.

Fast-a-Thon also honors the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Celebrated by over one billion Muslims worldwide, Ramadan is a time for Muslim reflection, appreciation, devotion to God and self-control. 

Ramadan is a month to reflect on a lot of the things that Muslims have gotten from God, according to MSA club member Omer Subhani.

"It's a time for both non-Muslims and Muslims to remember there are people living in different places who don't have food on a regular basis. That's what this month is about - remembering those people," Subhani said.

Thanks to on-campus lectures which address topics ranging from religious to social issues, Subhani hopes that the Fast-a-Thon will be yet another way for non-Muslims to learn about Islam.  

Yousef Kablawi, owner of Al-Nour Import, learned of the event through his daughter. Al-Nour Import, an import and export business, is one of the businesses sponsoring the event.  

Kablawi said the event provided a great opportunity for non-Muslims to get an idea about what Islam is about.

"People must get past the misconceptions about Islam. We may disagree on theology and political issues, but we can all agree on that we should help those who are less fortunate [and] who are hungry," Kablawi said.

Students interested in participating in the Fast-a-Thon can register at the Muslim Students Association table, located across the Graham Center pit from Monday through  Thursday between noon and 3p.m. The deadline for registration is Nov. 19.

Headline: Sammys showcase talent
Author: Jessica Martin/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is 7:45 p.m., a crowd anxiously waits for the doors of the Graham Center Ballrooms to open. The flier for the "Show Me the Talent" reads that the starting time for the show is 7:30. 

Behind the ballroom doors everyone is scrambling to squeeze in any last minute preparations and start the show. 

The members of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity work diligently to make this year's show memorable. One may ask why they go through so much trouble for this show. Are they doing it for bragging rights? No.

Sigma Alpha Mu, better known on campus as the "Sammys" do this to help fight a disease that plagues millions of adults and children: AIDS. 

Worldwide, approximately 28 million people have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic - approximately 5.6 million of them were children.  

In an effort to help fight this growing epidemic, Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity Inc hosts an annual charity function, "Show Me the Talent," a top notch charity function that showcases promising young talent. 

David Duperon, Sigma Alpha Mu activities chair, was in charge of booking the talent for this year's talent show.  

"I hope to be in the music business later on. The majority of the acts performing tonight are friends of mine, said Duperon. 

"Don't be surprised if you see these guys on MTV someday."

Each year the Sammys donate at least 15 percent of the night's proceeds to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation. 

Once the cost of the show is covered, the Sammys will donate ticket sales proceeds to charity and keep some to fund future Sammy charity events, such as The Hot Body Calendar. 

Since 1992, the Sammys have donated more than $10,000 in proceeds to various non-profit organizations including the United Way of Miami-Dade County as well as the Elizabeth Glaser foundation. 

The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation, founded in 1988, is the nation's leading non-profit organization dedicated to funding and conducting critical pediatric AIDS research. 

The Sammy's tradition of service and philanthropy began just after Hurricane Andrew. 

The show attempted to cheer up a saddened FIU student body while raising funds for a worthy cause.  

The show has grown tremendously since then. This year, "Show Me the Talent" featured 14 acts and sold more the 500 tickets.

Acts representing different genres of music were in attendance.  The showcase featured rock group Skylab, the 2003 winners of the Hard Rock Café battle of the bands and Crashing Tides, the winners of the FIU Battle of the Bands.

Many of the acts performing at the show have won local recognition by competing in numerous completions and showcasing their music on the internet. Hip-Hop trio Minority, the fastest growing group on mp3.com, performed their song "Rumble" featuring Just Phil. Minority has made their mark in the silver screen as well as the stage. Making an appearance in the movie Bad Boys 2, the group is rapidly growing in popularity. 

The show featured acts from every genre, including rock, hip-hop, and R & B. However, the performances were not limited to music, dancers performed as well. Dancing styles ranged from traditional flamenco to tap to break-dancing. Surprise guest "Billy the Marlin" wowed a hyped audience while dancing to Britney Spears's "In the Zone". Representatives from MTV and the College Television Network were also in attendance to observe rock band, Forelle, who recently won a contest on CTN and will be featured on MTV. 

For one night, different genres of music united to support an honorable cause. 

"It was a hot show" said Just Phil, one of the night's performers. "There isn't just one type of music here, there's a good mix of rock and hip-hop. It's cool to see that."

"I am excited for the overall experience," Karen Katz, director of Greek Affairs and judge for the evening. Fellow judges Maxine Hylton, assistant director of the Graham Center and, Ill Killa Vibe, (IKV) Productions A&R representative Brian "Precize" helped Katz make the final decision of the winners for this year's talent show.

After two hours of music, song, and dance, the evening closed with the announcing of the winners; third place went to the rock band All For Nothing; Minority was the runner-up and first prize went to dance group J- Funk. J-Funk won the votes of the judges by impersonating former pop group N*Sync. 

The winners walked away with trophies, but also left with feeling of knowing they helped contribute to a worthy cause. 

"It's a lot of fun to perform in the show.  I'm doing what I love to do and it's for a great cause. I am happy to be here," said tap dancer Sophi Aguair. Aguair along with her teacher Tatiana C, cast member of the musical "42nd Street," impressed the audience with their astounding dancing abilities by mixing old-school tap with hip-hop.

"The show was a great success. It came out exactly how I wanted," said Duperon. "As far as next year goes, I only see it getting bigger and better."

Headline: Rooney brings California sunshine to Florida
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
California power poppers Rooney lit up the stage at the Culture Room in Ft. Lauderdale on Nov. 12. The Sound, an energetic punk group from Sweden, and Damone, unfortunately replacing Palo Alto, opened the show.  

The club was full of anxious faces waiting to see their favorite band shower the stage with their upbeat presence. 

All three bands made sure to put the audience in a good mood with their catchy lyrics and happy rhythms.  

The first band Damone had to deal with disappointed fans awaiting to see Palo Alto. Damone demonstrated a great deal of energy but lacked the musical talent and originality that really draws in a crowd. It seems a little too pop and not enough rock and roll. 

The Swedish band The Sound quickly won over the hearts of audience members (including myself) with their retro sound and very memorable lead singer, a cool mixture of Joan Jett and Mick Jagger, as she swaggered down the stage making flirty eyes with the audience and swinging the mic playfully. 

Their sound is reminiscent of that old rock star that gives the finger to the man and loves black eye shadow. 

When Rooney took stage there were dozens of screaming fans awaiting the California band. 

With a mixture of Weezer and their brother band Phantom Planet, Rooney performed great live. With a lot of energy even though their was some technical difficulties, Rooney gave it their all. 

They sang the usual happy tunes like "Sorry, Sorry" and their famed single "I'm a Terrible Person." They mixed in a couple of slow tunes like "Blueside" and "That Girl has Love" that got the audience in lighter-waving mode as they swayed back and forth.

 They also added some knew songs like "Juice" which is another catchy tune much like "Sorry, Sorry." They ended the concert with "Shakin," probably the most infectious of all their songs. 

The concert was a great deal of fun for fans of this type of music.  For people looking to shake their tailfeathers to a different type of rock, the Culture Room was the place to be Wednesday. 

An appreciation for this type of music is needed to enjoy the infectious beats of Rooney, The Sound and Damone but, it is definitely worth at least checking out for those pop rock non-believers.

Headline: Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O starts trends
Author: Jim Abbott / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
Caterwauling howls, gutteral moans, animalistic yelps.

When Karen O, the trash-fashion-plate singer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, launches herself into a song, it's with the cinematic scope of an ex-film major - which she is - rather than the technique of a trained vocalist, which she isn't.

"I have a really strange relationship with my voice," she says by phone from her New York home. "I'm super-detached from it. When we first started writing music, I'd use tons of distortion on my vocals so it didn't even sound like my voice, but I'm getting a little more comfortable with how I use it. The relationship isn't as abstract as it used to be."

If that voice is otherworldy at times, it fits perfectly into the twisted sonic universe of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. 

The band harnesses its punk energy into an avant garde sensibility that melds drummer Brian Chase's fierce pounding, guitarist Nick Zinner's atonal elements, copious alcohol consumption and O's kitschy fishnets and fire-engine red lipstick into something that makes the Strokes look like the mannered prep school boys they are. 

Her favorite accessory of the moment is her lipstick, an easy-to-find retina burning shade called Wet and Wild: "It's 99 cents at the local pharmacy."

O's disheveled prom-queen look has launched a thousand imitators, who arrive at shows in torn evening dresses or punked-up leather and lace. They are also the target audience for designer "YYY" purses that augment the band's usual assortment of souvenirs.  The singer, an amiable if soft-spoken conversationalist, laughs at the notion she might have fashion tips for her fans.

"They've got it right on," she says. "They know exactly what they are doing. This is not a bunch of look-alike drones, these are cool girls dressing up for an event. We have a real event mentality about our shows, so we want people to rise to the occasion."

O characterizes the band's sound as "celebratory," but there is also a violent energy to her stage antics, which tend to leave her in a trancelike state after performances.

Sometimes, her alcohol-fueled antics (tequila or pink champagne are favorite libations) result in emergency-room visits such as a recent fall from a stage in Australia. She had been draped over a stage monitor when she dropped six feet into an orchestra pit.

"I took a really big fall head-first, then the monitor fell off the stage and hit me in the head."

Incredibly, no stitches were required.

"I didn't even get a concussion. I guess the monitor hit the thickest part of my skull. I was on painkillers for a while and had to do physical therapy, so I guess it was pretty serious."

The singer has mixed emotions about the influence of alcohol on the incident.

"It's ironic, because if I wasn't drunk probably I would have hurt myself much more, because I would have been more rigid falling off the stage. Of course, if I wasn't drunk, I wouldn't have been draping myself over the monitor in the first place."

O laughs in a "whatever" kind of way. It's apparent that such stories are more important than the massive hype that the band has sparked in the wake of two buzz-building EPs and the critically acclaimed major label debut, Fever to Tell. 

Rolling Stone praises the album for "stripping New Wave and metal and rockabilly down to primal thrust and blare. There are half a dozen songs under three minutes on "Fever to Tell," and they sound absolutely complete."

The same can't be said for O's style evolution, or de-evolution, perhaps. After dousing herself with olive oil for the band's first show, she is ready to tap into more primal forces.

"I'm more interested in makeup lately, something really sloppy to go along with the theatrical," she says. "I've been going a bit more animalistic and carnal. Back to sort of like running around in the forest with mud smeared all over your face kind of thing."

Headline: Local support helps Forelle win CTN contest
Author: Joyce Fábregas / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
MTV2 and CTN representatives graced FIU University Park campus with their presence as they formally announced the winners of the 2003 Best Music on Campus. 

The contest began in October when local bands sent in their music videos and voting was open until November 3 where the top 3 finalists were chosen, and then finally a winner. Local band Forelle, some of whose members attend FIU, sent in their video for their song "Fractions" and were selected as the winner. 

Forelle's manager, Jose Gonzalez, was the first informed of the great news. MTV called Jose and congratulated them on their win and informed him that MTV2 and CTN would go to FIU and shoot interviews on the band for 3 shows and film the band doing a live performance that same evening. The footage will be shown on "MTV news: you hear it first", a show called "Freshmen", and a segment called "Advanced Warning" which will also become a CD compilation that will be released nationally. 

On Thursday, MTV2 and CTN met with the band in the University Park campus as Maria, a famous MTV2 VJ interviewed them. 

Friends and fans gathered around the piano room alongside the band as they were being interviewed. 

"The interview was a great experience and the people were easy to work with", said Javi Bolea, the band's electronics player; "I think we got our point across about our personality and what Forelle stands for."

Later that same evening, MTV2 stuck around as Forelle was scheduled to perform at local fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu's 11th annual Talent Show. 

Right before the band's performance, Maria took the stage and informed the crowd about the CTN contest and how Forelle, representing FIU and Miami, had won. The crew filmed Forelle's performance and fans rocking out to their amazing music. 

The band was extremely happy to have won. They think this is a great opportunity to show Forelle to the world. "We appreciate the opportunity we have been given and we look forward to reaching as many people as possible, doing what we love," said Tommy Garrett, the band's drummer. Forelle will now receive MTV exposure, be part of a CD compilation, and will have meetings with Atlantic Records and Dreamworks. Keep an eye out for these guys, they're definitely rock-stars in the making.

Headline: Thursday concert packed an emotional high-energy punch
Author: Vivian Little / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Raw fingers plucked guitar strings in the smoke thickened air. 

Suddenly Claudio Sanchez opened his mouth and high pitched, harmonious lyrics pour out, captivating the densely packed crowd of over 600. 

Pushed, shoved; rubbing against other sweaty bodies did nothing to damper the audience's attention.

Coheed and Cambria opened up Wednesday night at the Ovation club in Boynton Beach. Their brief, but musically tight five songs entrenched the patrons in awestruck stares. 

On tour promoting their new album In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3, Coheed and Cambria blew away the patrons at Ovation with their epic songwriting reminiscent of bands like Rush. 

"Devil in Jersey City," "Blood Red Summer," and "Favor House Atlantic" threw the crowd into a frenzy. Moist, clammy hands pounded the clouded air of the club and would continue through Thrice and onto Thursday's set.

Thrice's distorted staccato guitar riffs, tight tempo changes and up front music was enriched by lead singer Dustin Kensrue's lush angst. Performing part of their older album Illusion of Safety as well as newer songs from Artist in the Ambulance; Thrice created a pit frenzy.

Confetti, a broken amp and a political message were just extras to the Thursday set. Headlining the tour along with Thrice, Thursday left nothing to be desired. Anxiously awaiting singer Geoff Rickly's appearance on stage, the crowd began to grow restless. 

When Thursday finally appeared it was to cheers and claps, before any music even began.

 Playing such hits as "Understanding in a Car Crash," "Cross Out the Eyes," "Steps  Ascending," "Signals Over the Air,"  and  "Jet Black New Year" the set was high energy and luscious all the way through. Though all three bands must have been fatigued from their stint in St.Petersburg just the night before, the bands performed flawlessly vigorous performances. 

It was a privilege to watch such creative bands live, and if you ever get the chance I strongly recommend it.

Headline: "Love Actually":  Romcom has uncommon sense about love
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Shakespeare invented it, Jane Austen polished it, and nobody does it better these days than Richard Curtis: the romantic comedy.

Curtis, who wrote "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Notting Hill" and the little-seen-but-hilarious "The Tall Guy," is the go-to guy for romcoms because his sentimental-with-a-streak-of-cynicism writing is so perfect for these times: He believes in love, but he knows how hard it is to find. And that has never been truer than in "Love Actually," a movie that opens with the assertion that "Love, actually, is all around" and then shows us how often it is hidden, mislabeled or confused.

Rather than take the usual tack of showing us one couple's treacherous road to the altar, "Love Actually" gives us more than a dozen characters, each of whom is learning something about first love, unrequited love, unfaithful love, unattainable love or improbable love. The movie is constructed like a maze: At the beginning, we don't know how any of the people are related, but, as the story turns new corners and reveals new dimensions, the picture becomes clear.

Or, rather, it becomes as clear as love ever is, because "Actually" has an uncommon sense of the obstacles in the path of love. It's an untidy movie in the best sense, one in which there's a strong feeling that the characters are unwilling to act in the way you expect romantic comedy characters to act - they ignore each other, fall in love with the wrong person, break each other's hearts. The movie is about falling in love, but it's about falling out of it, too.

There are enough stories in "Love Actually" that even if some don't appeal to you, others will. Curtis constructs little gem-like moments for his ensemble of actors (there is no lead performer), and I'd argue that the best involve Emma Thompson, who has an unforgettable scene in which she uses Joni Mitchell's incredible remake of "Both Sides, Now" to summon her courage, and Laura Linney, in a deftly surprising encounter that reveals why her character is alone. But you may be equally moved by Hugh Grant as a randy prime minister.

Things get a little off-track near the end, when a couple of lesser storylines take center stage and when Curtis tries to make distracting pop songs do too much of the work his writing should do. It's crazy for a writer this gifted to rely on that crutch, but, then, his subject is a little crazy, too. This is a movie whose every perfect detail is designed to show us that if you look at the cold, hard facts about love, it makes no sense at all, but the movie tries to figure it out, anyway. And so, of course, do we.

Headline: FIU goes abroad with Shakespeare
Subheadline: Additional D.C. trip includes John Fletcher's "The Tamer Tamed"
Author: Heather Brummer / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Our college years are notorious for many reasons - partying and pulling all-nighters to name a couple - but something that people often miss out on is the opportunity to travel. Students give themselves all sorts of excuses as to why they can't pack their bags and go but, the truth is, there's no better time than now to see the world. 

Luckily, most colleges provide study abroad programs which allow students to earn credit hours and travel at the same time. FIU is no exception; The university offers several trips throughout the year, each of which takes its participants around the globe. 

One such event is an annual excursion to England, led by professor Phillip Church, from the Theatre Department, and professor Peggy Endel, from the English Department. 

The trip, which celebrates its seventh anniversary this year, offers students the chance to study the life and works of William Shakespeare while vacationing in England. 

Like most of the study abroad programs offered at FIU, the event starts by spending the first part of the summer studying, in this case selected works which will relate to the upcoming trip. The excitement begins immediately after, when students fly to England, where they will spend the next two weeks immersing themselves in the culture.  The program takes its participants to many historic sites, including Shakespeare's birthplace, Oxford University, and the famous Broughton castle (home of actors Joseph and Ralph Fiennes and filming location of the 1998 film, "Shakespeare in Love").

There is also free time for visits to numerous other historical sites in England such as the House of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. And for those who enjoy the night life, professor Endel mentions the Black Swan Pub, known worldwide as "the dirty duck", where both actors and the public gather at dusk to kick up their feet and recover from the day.

This summer's trip will include eight Shakespear performances at such places as the New Globe theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. 

With all of the opportunities, there is never a dull moment on the trip. As professor Church likes to say: "The students take off running as soon as the plane touches down."

So what can one expect to do during their two weeks in England? Plenty. A typical day begins with a traditional English breakfast over discussions of the show which was seen the previous evening. 

Students have some time to themselves before an afternoon lecture about the upcoming production which they will then see later that evening. Most of the traveling around the area will be done on foot or a double decker bus. Students will stay in Victorian guest houses in the beautiful town of Stratford-Upon-Avon and have the chance to take in the culture and hopefully do some shopping for souvenirs along the way. 

The cost of the trip is $2,980 this year and includes all airfare, transportation, accommodations and meals during the two week stay. Additionally, financial aid is often available for students who use their class credit to apply towards their university degree. Professor Church also notes that the holidays are right around the corner and students might consider asking for funding for the trip in place of traditional gifts.

 This year a new program, "Shakespeare in Washington," was introduced to FIU. The condensed alternative to the England trip, takes students to Washington for three days where they will see Shakespeare productions which will soon move overseas to England. 

Though not as lengthy a trip, the Washington excursion also gives students the opportunity to see famous places such as the Smithsonian and the National Holocaust Museum and provides an alternative for those who for whatever reason, need a shorter trip. Although this year's deadline has passed, Professor Church and Professor Endel may decide to make it an annual event, depending on how their first voyage turns out.

If you are interested in either trip, you may contact professor Phillip Church at (305) 348 - 3358 or professor Peggy Endel at (305) 348 - 3368. For further information, log on to www.fiu.edu/~england and/or http://www.shakespeare.org.uk.

Bon voyage !

&nbsp;
To the Editor:

The story on the front page of the November 18, 2003 issue of The Beacon written by Vanessa Gomez was a comprehensive analysis of the facts surrounding the proposed increase in the Athletic fee.  However, as Chairperson of the Fee Committee, I feel compelled to point out a significant piece of information that needs to be corrected.  The event described in the article was in fact a public hearing scheduled and arranged by the Fee Committee for the purpose of receiving feedback from the student body regarding the proposed increase.  It clearly was NOT a meeting convened by the Athletic Department for the purpose of promoting their requested fee increase, as was reported.  The Athletic Director did make a presentation and was available for questions and answers, but it was the Fee Committee that scheduled and convened the hearing and the committee members eligible to vote were present to hear the feedback from students.  Thank you in advance for printing this clarification.

Headline: FTAA march
Subheadline:  
Author: vcorne01@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
I'm not quite finished with this piece but wanted to get it out to you before the weekend.  I hope you'll consider printing it next week.  thanks, ginny

I participated in the large, organized FTAA protest march in downtown Miami on Thursday.  There were over 10,000 people involved in the march.  Many of them were middle-aged Americans who came all the way from Wisconsin or Indiana or even Canada to join forces with their fellow Union members or special interest groups in the march.  There were quite a few older people there as well - the kinds you'd expect to see as greeters at Wal-Mart rather than at a demonstration against corporate greed.  There were people of many colors and ethnic backgrounds.  And of course there were the dreadlocked kids in battered Converse sneakers and tie-dyed shirts and multiple body piercings.
Some people carried signs that read "Fair Trade for Healthy Communities, not Free Trade for Corporate Profits" or "FTAA Sucks".  Some groups wore matching t-shirts to show their solidarity.  A scattered few chanted rhymes such as "FTAA, No Way!!!" or the old protest standard "The People United Will Never Be Divided!".  And some said nothing, carried no signs, and wore no uniforms but rather marched alongside those who did to support a cause they believed enough in to take time out of their lives and money out of their pockets to attend.  I was one of those.  
	And as this peaceful, even spiritual, demonstration wound through the streets, with police armored from head-to-toe in riot gear lining the streets in a wall of power, and news cameras zipping through the crowd every few feet and police helicopters buzzing constantly overhead, there seemed to be a grand sense of purpose.  We all knew why we were there and were even giddy with enthusiasm in being able to express ourselves in this very public forum. 
As this mass of people snaked through the streets, I kept thinking how beautiful it was all going to look on t.v.  How the news choppers would be able to capture the beautiful image of all these people from different countries and workplaces and socio-economic backgrounds linking arms through the streets in this grand protest.  The vastness of it all would look spectacular on the local news, filling the screen from edge to edge with this living work of art and of democracy in action.
	When I got home, I flipped channels from CBS to NBC to ABC and even tried FOX, anxious to see the demonstration from a different vantage point and to share it with Miami and the world.  Every time one station took a break, I flipped to another.  Coverage on some stations was non-stop until 7:00 p.m.  
But my artistic vision never materialized.  All that was talked about ad nauseum, all the footage that was shown, from one channel to the next, were the clashes with the police and the anarchists setting a garbage dumpster on fire and long-haired protesters getting pelted with rubber bullets and pepper spray.  There were live aerial shots of protesters with handkerchiefs covering their mouths and noses tossing rocks and garbage at the police wall.  There were the reporters interviewing witnesses with handcuffed protesters lined up on their knees along the wall in the background.  Even in the Miami Herald the storylines read "Cautious police blow up a can of paint" and "Miami streets calm this afternoon as tensions ebb".   Nearly all of the photos showed fists raised in anger or a bloodied face or a handcuffed kid in a black t-shirt.  Yes, the troublemakers were there.  Yes, they caused the trouble they'd come to cause.  And yes, there were skirmishes and arrests and even a couple of small fires.  And yes, of course they deserve news coverage.  
But I need to know, where were the photos of the grandparents and steelworkers and lawyers and teachers and college students and religious leaders with whom I walked for nearly 2 hours?  What about that gathering at Bayfront amphitheatre with the color-blocks of Union members nodding their heads in agreement with the speakers.  And where was the video showing musicians on the stage singing "Time Has Come Today" with the crowd on their feet, singing along?  What about the residents gathered in small groups along the streets cheering us on, telling us "the eyes of the world are upon you"?  And not even a single shot of police officers, so intimidating and somber, giving the occasional nod and smile as we said "we're marching for you, too".

               Oral Contraceptives
  Modern women are increasingly choosing to take control of their bodies and lives by eliminating the dependence on males for sexual protection.
  By having the power to control contraceptive use, women are capable of successfully preventing pregnancies as well as advantaging from the positive effects oral contraceptives offer, Nurse Practitioner Phylis Craig said.
  Approximately 70 percent of women of reproductive age are sexually active and could unintentionally become pregnant if they or their partner fail to use contraceptive methods.
  "I am 19 and trying to graduate from college. I don't need a baby right now," University of Florida student Kimberly Araguez said.
  By using oral contraceptives as opposed to male condoms, Araguez and other women are decreasing their chances of pregnancy. 
  Studies show that approximately between 3 and fourteen women will become pregnant out of 100 whose partners use condoms for one year.
  If used correctly for one year, oral contraceptives are 99.9% effective , however, there is a 5 percent failure rate for those who take pills late or forget them, Craig said.
  "There's no one you can trust more than yourself when it comes to protection," Araguez said. 
  This difference in effectiveness can be attributed to the composition of oral contraceptives which work by suppressing ovulation, Craig said.
  "They also act on the mucous of the cervix making it thicker and less likely for sperm to pass up into the uterus, and they also cause the lining of the uterus to become thinner and less hospitable to a pregnancy," Craig said. 
  University of Florida student, Olga Ramos, 24, continuously uses the pill and prefers to control her own body responsibly as opposed to dealing with the uncertainties of others' actions, Ramos said. 
  "I feel more comfortable knowing that my chances of pregnancy are very minimal," Ramos said. 
  Although oral contraceptives are effective in preventing pregnancies, they also produce benefits to women such as keeping the menstrual cycle regular and decreasing menstrual cramps, Craig said. 
  When not on the pill, Ramos suffers from severe cramps that do not allow her to function as well as she could, Ramos said. 
  Oral contraceptives also provide regulation of the menses, decreased menstrual flows, cramps, acne, ovarian and eudiometrical cancer, ovarian cysts, risks of ectopic pregnancy and provides protection against benign breast disease, Craig said.
  But oral contraceptives come with side effects and disadvantages, including nausea, weight gain or loss, irregular bleeding, no protection against sexually transmitted infections, headaches, mood changes as well as costing money and having to be taken daily, Craig said. 
  Despite the risks, the pills benefits outweigh most concerns.
  Maureen Miller, coordinator of education/training at the University of Florida Student Health Care Center believes that oral contraceptives are a good method to prevent pregnancy, she said. 
  "Birth control pills are good for women who are able to take them on a daily basis," Maureen said. "Although condoms are always good to use anyway."
  The main risk is for women who are older than 35 and smoke because they have a higher chance of having cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, stroke or blood clots in the leg, Miller said
  Even though oral contraceptives are not the only form of birth control available, it is the most popular hormonal contraceptive method in the United States, however, newer methods such as the patch and the vaginal ring are gaining ground, Craig said. 
  But for those who use condoms as their primary form of birth control, spermicidal are recommended as well as the Morning After Pill in case the condom breaks, Craig said. 
  "It kind of gives women that freedom to take control and that's a huge step of independence," Miller said. LLL
