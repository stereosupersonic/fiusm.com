Headline: Tough schedule ahead for basketball
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As everyone on campus prepares for finals and the holiday break that follows, the FIU men's basketball team has nothing but tough games on its mind.

In just under a month of play, the Golden Panthers will take to the court eight times in what should be one of the toughest stretches of the season.

Following the game against Florida Tech at Pharmed Arena on Dec. 9, the Golden Panthers will travel to Tallahassee to face Florida State University. Afterward, the team is off to Tampa two days later for another state match-up against South Florida University. Two days before Christmas, FIU will return home to face George Washington University, one of the hottest teams in the country.

First-year head coach Sergio Rouco, along with the rest of the Golden Panther team, knows what they are up against and is taking each game one step at a time. 

"We are trying to play the best competition we can before [the start of] conference play," coach Rouco.

The Colonials are coming off a season where the team proved they deserve to be a legitimate top-25 team and one that can contend for a spot in the Final Four come March. 

George Washington won the BB&T classic for the third time in school history, following consecutive upsets of top-25 teams, No.11 Michigan State and No. 12 Maryland. 

FIU and George Washington have met twice in the previous two seasons. The Colonials won in Miami during the 2002-2003 season and showed their dominance again last year in Washington D.C., beating the Golden Panthers, 76-67.

This will be the toughest game the Golden Panthers play over the eight-game Christmas break, and Rouco has his mind set on what must be done. 

"We are going to play them as best we can, but we are not going to take it as a game we are going to throw off and lose ... We don't do that," he said.

Before the new year, the Golden Panthers will host the FIU Holiday Tournament at Pharmed Arena on Dec. 27 and 28. The tournament features an opening game between Ohio University and Binghamton University followed by a game between Colgate University and FIU.

The next day's games feature a consolation match between the two losing teams, followed by a championship game; tip-off is scheduled for 8 p.m.

Rouco looks forward to the challenge that faces his team on Dec. 27. 

"Colgate gave Syracuse a good game," Rouco said. "We're at home, and hopefully we have played enough good teams," he said. 

Following an eight-day break for the  new year, FIU hits the road for a two- game swing in Arkansas that opens up the Sun Belt Conference schedule.

Rouco likes the small break the team will have.

"It will be good for me to get away from the players and for them to get away from me," he said.

On Jan. 6, exactly one year after the two teams last met, the Golden Panthers face Arkansas-Little Rock in a game where the Golden Panthers look to avenge a 12-point loss from last season.

Revenge may seem to be the motivation when FIU plays any conference game this year, since the team only managed one win in 14 games last season. The team will also face Arkansas State University two days after Arkansas-Little Rock.

The Golden Panthers haven't defeated either team since the 1999-2000 season, when they won back-to-back games on the road in a similar road trip. That was also the last season FIU had a winning record, finishing the year 16-14, 9-7 in the conference.

However, for the team to be successful, the play of some of their stars must  rise. 

"Raphael daSilva has to pick it up some, and Junior [Matias] has to play a little more consistent," explained Rouco. "We also need to get more output from our freshmen."

When it comes to overall team play, the coach knows what needs to be done.  

"We have to work on the rotation: Five guys that start and few coming off the bench that all eye in on what we are trying to teach them," said Rouco. 

All in all, the upcoming eight games should be a tough test for the young squad. If the Golden Panthers can finish with a winning or .500 record, it will be an interesting team come conference time.

Subheadline: Owls win Shula Bowl
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU football closed its third year of intercollegiate play with a loss at Pro Player Stadium in the third annual Don Shula Bowl, on Dec. 7.

 Senior quarterback, Jared Allen, closed his NCAA career with 311 yards and two touchdowns, both to Roosavelt Bynes, as the Fighting Owls downed the Golden Panthers, 17-10.

With a 17-3 deficit in the fourth quarter, the Panthers rallied late to a 15-play, 84-yard drive that culminated in a Chandler Williams 5-yard touchdown reception from Josh Padrick, trimming the Owls' lead to seven with 11 seconds left in the game. 

FIU recovered an onside kick, but two long attempts at the end-zone fell incomplete and Florida Atlantic University held on for their third consecutive win over FIU.

After the game, Coach Don Strock showed faint signs of optimism despite the disappointment. "You might say were closing the gap on them," Strock said. "Next year we'll both be in the Sun-Belt, and hopefully this game will mean something at the end."

 Padrick finished his second active season with 2,269 yards, 12 touchdowns and 13 interceptions, while completing 57 percent of his passes. The red-shirted sophomore completed his second 2,000+ yard season in as many years.

Rashod Smith struggled to 48 yards rushing, but finished with an all-time best 1,133 yards, becoming the first FIU running back to reach the 1,000-yard mark in a single season.	 

The Golden Panthers finished the hurricane-altered schedule with a 3-7 record, while the Owls went 9-3 on the season. 

After a scoreless first quarter, the Owls marched deep into FIU territory, managing a first and goal from the FIU one yard line. 

However, good play from Tiger Clark's defense and a little help from an illegal procedure penalty meant that FAU had to settle for a 24-yard field goal attempt that Mark Meyers sent bouncing off the right upright -no good.  

Meyers made up for the miss by hitting from 32 yards out on FAU's next possession, giving the Owls a 3-0 advantage. 

 With 1:20 left in the first half and the Panthers at their own 37-yard line, Padrick connected on two passes to Cory McKinney for 45 yards combined, followed by a 10-yard completion to Williams. 

But with only three seconds left, FIU was forced to settle for the equalizer as Adam Moss's 25-yard field goal split the uprights.

McKinney's eight receptions for 139 yards earned him the majority vote for FIU's MVP of the Don Shula Bowl, which was decided by the media.

FAU opened the second half with a 15-play, 88-yard drive that ended on a 5-yard touchdown reception by Bynes. The lead was extended when Allen, FAU's Don Shula Bowl MVP, found Bynes again for a 51-yard touchdown and a 17-3 Owls' lead.

"It was the same old story," said Coach Don Strock. "We kept it close to the bitter end, but we didn't make a play when we had to, defensively or offensively. We had opportunities all day."

Headline: Not just one letter separates FAU from FIU
Author: Messod Bendayan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For the 3rd year in a row, FIU has fallen to Florida Atlantic University, and that has prompted a popular question: What the hell is going on?

Why have the Owls managed to look so dominant when the Golden Panthers have managed, at best, to produce a great Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde impersonation? 

Why, over the last two seasons, has FAU been 20-6 and ready to rock-and-roll its way into the Sun Belt Conference, while FIU is 5-17 and can't beat anyone except itself?

It's been four years since FAU's first season of football;  FIU came in a year later. Unfortunately for FIU, it has trailed the Owls ever since.

Waiting a year to begin the football program will help FIU in the long-term, because Don Strock has more time to build the infrastructure of the program. 

FAU on the other hand, ran into some serious stumbling blocks, such as playing at a mostly empty and off-campus Pro Player Stadium its first year. 

But it gave the Owls an extra year of I-AA football, and saw FAU go 11-3 in 2003 before falling a game short of the national championship game.

Even more impressive was the way FAU reacted after their first two losses - a 45-17 spanking in the home opener against Division II Valdosta State (one they should have won) and a 33-29 loss against I-A Central Florida. 

The Owls rolled off 10 straight victories, six of which they won by 10 points or fewer, including one against FIU.

This FIU team didn't have that kind of season. But why?

FAU's first two seasons are almost a mirror image of FIU's:  A 4-6 record in their inaugural season, followed by a 2-9 season where the level of competition rose and saw the Owls blow a lot of games. FIU went 5-6 and 2-10, respectively.

But FAU stayed in I-AA their third season, which meant staying with roughly the same kind of schedule that they had the previous season.  And that year was the year they broke out big too. The Owls pulled out a lucky last-second win against Middle Tennessee University in the season opener, their first win against a I-A opponent- something FIU has yet to do. 

FAU also won a lot of close games, which shows the growth of the program and the confidence the team has built. 

Having head coach Howard Schnellenberger roaming the sideline helps too. The experience he has with building a winning college program is second to none. 

That doesn't just mean recruiting players and teaching them how to play, it's also about scheduling.

Take a look at the third year schedules of FAU and FIU on the chart on page eight.

FIU had less margin for error. The talent level was higher. FIU had to play cleaner in order to win, but they just couldn't do it. 

Eventually, it led to a snowball effect where the confidence to win wasn't there, much like in 2003. Then, dumb mistakes sealed the deal.

To be fair, the Owls didn't have to deal with the mess Miami's move to the ACC made until their third season was over. But they were ready to make that move by then, and they had real reasons to believe they could compete in I-A. 

Their 9-3 record this season is proof of that. FIU simply  wasn't ready, as its 3-7 record proved. 

It reacted to a changing environment, but didn't realize that it hadn't evolved enough to handle that new environment.

To paraphrase an old saying: You can't unspill the milk. So what does FIU do now?There's only one thing that can be done: Win games. A lot of games.

With a senior-heavy squad next season, it might be FIU's best chance in a while to prove that they can be a success both on the field and in the stands. 

But with a full I-A schedule next season, including Texas Tech and Kansas State, forgive me if I can't see a team that has yet to beat a I-A team, be successful against a schedule full of them.

As a current student and soon-to-be alumnus, I hope I'm wrong. I hope I'm made to look like a complete and utter fool. But I don't think I will be.

Headline: How to survive a dysfunctional family christmas
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
With the semester finally winding down, it's time for many college students to traditionally go home for the holidays. For some, this is a comforting time when they get to relax and reconnect with their families. 

Others, however,  go to college to get away from their crazy families and find it more appealing to reconnect with an electrical outlet. I fall into this second category. 

If you're anything like me, you've become accustomed to the bickering, the fights and the occasional "mishap" with the electric turkey carver, but after being around sane people for so long, it may be difficult to cope after being thrown back to the wolves. 

Granted though, you have probably dated at least three people (of various genders), changed your major twice, and have experienced both mental and spiritual growth while in college. Yet, once you walk through the door of your family's house, you're still 12 years old and experience the same sights and smells. 

Your mother still greets you with, "Wow, you've gained weight." Your father is still nowhere to be found (along with the Jack Daniels). Your cousins are still biting each other over who will get to play Nintendo next. 

And of course, Mima is still wandering the backyard, talking to an imaginary neighbor she had in Cuba - 50 years ago. 

Making it through the day will be tough, but following a plan will assuage, if not prevent the massive psychological scars that are yet to come.

SMALL TALK

So you grab yourself some eggnog (two or three cups if it's alcoholic), and make your way to the couch. You see your aunt and uncle. Deploy the pleasantries. Tell them how you are without actually divulging any information. 

This way, nothing of value will get back to your parents. Remember, the key phrase of any family gathering is "trust no one." If anything, keep a 24-hour news source on the TV. 

You'll remember to talk about current events, and the noise will fill the awkward silence when your aunt asks you why you didn't go to an Ivy League school like your sister did.  

YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

Now that you've spent two months of work-study salary on gifts for ungrateful jackals, it's time to see what glorious I-don't-know-you-at-all gifts you receive. Keep a poker face. Accept all gifts graciously, even the thighmaster from your mother and the Best of Hall and Oates CD from your father. If they even sense dissatisfaction, it will give them ammunition for the ritual post-dinner fight. 

PASS THE POTATOES

Dinner is served - finally, a time where you aren't forced to communicate. Take a little bit of everything, even if it tastes like an old boot. This way, "Why didn't you have any of the casserole?" doesn't turn into your weeping mother locking herself in the bathroom, screaming, "No one appreciates me! There's no reason to live!" 

PROPS TO THE ELDERLY

Once the evening has wound down and your family is boozed up, you know it's time to depart. Say goodbye to everyone and be sure to hug your grandparents. While they are inexcusably responsible for your mess of a family, they are also the ones who have survived it the longest, making them admirable if not eligible for sainthood.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

It is inevitable that at some point, the focus will be on you, and your self-esteem will be torn apart by at least two if not all of your family members. Have an emergency plan. When things get rough, drop some juicy information about a sibling, and then sneak out the bathroom window. 

The fact that your brother impregnated someone will certainly trump the topic of your failing grade - whether or not this is true is inconsequential.

Subheadline: Environmental research reports to President Maidique
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As part of an environmental class, students conducted several studies about the environment and how the research can be implemented on campus. These are exclusive reports to President Modesto A. Maidique

Dear President Maidique,

Students at FIU are very concerned about the effects of global climate change and our university's contribution to it.  We have, therefore, examined ways to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve the environmental policies at FIU.  We specifically looked at reducing emissions at the University Park apartments and the positive effects of native landscaping.

First, we would like to say that the apartments have wonderful native trees planted in the vicinity.  These shade bearing trees help to reduce energy use by keeping the apartments cooler than they would be in direct sunlight.  A simple step to drastically reduce energy costs even more would be to paint the flat roofs of the apartments with reflective paint.  Solar heat is absorbed by dark surfaces and this translates into more money being spent to cool the place down.  Reflective surfaces bounce solar heat away allowing buildings to stay cooler.  It is estimated that painting a one story building with reflective paint can reduce the air conditioning cost by 20% the next day.  We believe the money  saved on energy costs over the next couple of decades will trump the initial cost of painting all of the apartment roofs.

Proper landscaping is a great way to beautify the campus while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  It is important to plant native plants that are accustomed to South Florida's soil and weather conditions.  There is a wide range of benefits that accompany the utilization of native plants in landscaping.  Because native plants require less water and pesticides, less money has to be spent on maintaining them.  Underneath the canopy of a large shade tree, the temperature can be up to 9 degrees F lower (DOE).  They improve air quality by removing dust, particulates, and carbon dioxide, slow the movement of storm water runoff, and supply oxygen.  Even when performing these valuable services, they can reduce cooling-demand of a structure.  Carefully positioned trees-those that shade windows and roofs for most of the day-can save up to 25% of a building's demand for cooling.

The effects of global warming are cause for alarm. We would like to see FIU take easy steps to reduce its contribution to this problem.  In doing so, FIU can be proud to join other elite "green" campuses like Harvard, Tufts, and Penn State University.  Native landscaping and reflective paint will not only save money, it will quite possibly help sustain our way of life.

Miami, Fl 33199

Dear President Maidique,

As environmental students we believe that it is important to make the Florida International University (FIU) community aware of ways in which our environment can be improved and made more eco-friendly. Our mission this semester was to look at ways in which FIU could become more energy efficient by using solar energy. This was a massive undertaking and we had to narrow down the scope. 

We decided to that we would focus on the Preserve. For the last few years proposals for expansion of the university have been looking at the Preserve as prime real-estate. FIU students and faculty have been tending and caring for this area since the 1970's and the preserve is the only reminder of the natural history of South Florida and it is therefore an indispensable area of the FIU campus. 

The preserve also provides an excellent location for our Environmental and Biology students to learn and study ecosystems, the Everglades and the natural biodiversity of South Florida. A small building could be constructed on the edge of the preserve that would be used as an outdoor classroom and for small entertaining and fundraising functions. Development of the preserve should be kept to a minimum and any development which does take place should promote the educational values which the preserve offers. Using solar energy systems in the preserve will enhance the educational value of the preserve. A solar energy efficient building in the preserve is likely to encourage new interest from students and faculty of the Physics and engineering Departments.

FIU is a progressive university, which is striving to become one of the best universities in the nation. FIU is one of the few Universities which has the advantage of a nature preserve on campus, and we can further set ourselves apart from other universities by using the solar energy to provide a building with electricity. Solar energy is a simple and effective way to introduce sustainable and environmentally friendly development. Solar energy can be easily attained by the general public and it is the responsibility of this progressive institution to educate people about it and its importance. Sustainable development is vital to the maintenance and longevity of our environment.

There are a few Ivy League universities that have implemented the use of solar energy on campus. In many cases they have made proposals to convert existing buildings or that future buildings are completely energy efficient and take advantage of solar power. FIU has the optimal climatic conditions for using solar energy and should take advantage of this. This is yet another way that we can enter the league of the nation's best and most progressive universities.

Sincerely,

The Solar Group

Students claim the dreidel record

Indiana University's largest Jewish organization put a new spin on Hanukkah on Sunday by claiming an unofficial "whirled" record.

Armed with tiny wooden tops emblazoned with Hebrew characters, more than 500 people perched cross-legged on the floor of the university's Gladstein Fieldhouse flicking their wrists, pinching their fingers and trying to earn a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for twirling the most dreidels simultaneously.

 Dreidel spinners were hoping for a miracle number of 536. Students at the University of Maryland hold the world record of 535 dreidels spun in 1999. The Mayer Kaplan Jewish Community Center in Skokie set the original record of 289 in 1998.

"Given the rivalry between Maryland and IU in basketball in the NCAA, we had to take on the challenge here," said Steve Kolmin, a coordinator of the event sponsored by Indiana University's Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life.

He said 541 participated in the event, which he hopes will break Maryland's record.

But the so-called "dreidel bash" was also a way to spread the meaning of Hanukkah across a multitude of faiths.

"A lot of people think it's the Jewish Christmas, which it's not," said Rabbi Sue Shifron, executive director of IU's Hillel.

Both the phrase and the game are intended to remind Jews of their battle for religious freedom and instill a sense of pride. In the Hanukkah story, legend has it that Jews, who were forbade to study the Torah, would do their lessons with a dreidel by their side. When soldiers approached, they would whip out their dreidels as a decoy.

"It was really the first victory over religious persecution in the world," said David Vonnegut-Gabovitch, president of Hillel's board of directors, who drove from Indianapolis to spin. "That's why it should be more of a universal celebration."

NATIONAL

President Arnold Schwarzenegger?

Some fans of the California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, like the sound of that so much that they are joining a growing movement to allow foreign-born citizens to become president.

For most of the 216 years since the adoption of the Constitution, there has been little debate about Article 2, Section 1, which states: "No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President."

But now there are four proposals in Congress to amend the Constitution to permit foreign-born citizens to be president, after a lengthy period of citizenship. Three of the measures were introduced before Schwarzenegger became governor last year, and their sponsors say the amendments were not crafted with him in mind.

Schwarzenegger, though, has become the poster child of the movement, and he has said he would consider running for president if the Constitution allowed. Last month, TV commercials, created by a Schwarzenegger fund-raiser, were shown in California urging support for an "amend for Arnold" campaign. 

In a Gallup poll conducted last month, 31 percent of respondents said they favored such an amendment, compared with 28 percent in the summer. The pollsters mentioned Schwarzenegger to half of the respondents, and that produced a slightly higher favorable response: 39 percent said they favored an amendment when Schwarzenegger's name was included.

The effort to change the Constitution is an uphill battle. To take effect, a constitutional amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate and by the legislatures of 38 states. Since the Constitution was ratified, more than 11,000 amendments have been offered; 27 have been approved.

Headline: Grammar test complaints heard: policy revised
Author: Amanda Ramírez Castañeda / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After three weeks of turmoil, students of the School of Journalism and Mass Communications (SJMC) are relieved that  the faculty and administration have responded to their concerns regarding the required grammar exam. Students have been experiencing  some technical difficulties with the grammar exam's online study materials.

SJMC students must take this grammar exam to enroll in various courses that are required for their degree.  

To pass the exam, they must achieve the required grade for each specific course.  

Students must score at least 65 percent to be eligible to enroll in the department's first mandatory grammar class, Writing Strategies. In more advanced courses the grade requirement is 85 percent.  

On Dec. 3, students received an e-mail from Patricia B. Rose, professor and associate dean of the SJMC, stating that journalism students may register for next semester's courses that require a grammar exam score, regardless of whether or not they have the score needed to enter.  These students must have already completed Writing Strategies and must sign an acknowledgement  statement. If the student does not achieve the required score for the corresponding class by Feb. 15, 2005, they will automatically be dropped from the course.

According to Rose, this arrangement was made in response to the numerous complaints the department has received from students who have experienced problems with the study materials on the grammar test webpage, www.thewordassociation.com. SJMC students access regularly in order to use the grammar book, practice quizzes and practice tests provided there.

"At the school we really are concerned when students are upset. We really do pay serious attention to the problems," Rose said.  "After speaking to many students and a lot of faculty, we tried to figure out what we could realistically do that would be fair to everyone."

SJMC students not only complained to the department via e-mail and in person, but also circulated a petition in order to let the department know their concerns.  

The department received the petition on Nov. 30, which was signed by more than 100 students.  

"I'm really happy, and we are all very grateful," said Marianly Hernandez, majoring in broadcast journalism.  "I think the solution is fair, and we all hope the website will be fixed soon." 

One problem with the Word Association webpage was the slow upload of quizzes and exams. Another was that, on occasion, after a  student would access a quiz and answered some of the questions, the quiz would simply stop working. 

When this happens, the student must begin the quiz again or try to access the webpage later.  

Students say that, because of this, they are not able to prepare for the exam and, therefore, are not able to obtain the required scores.

According to Kevin Hall, Editor-In-Residence and head of the Journalism Writing Project (the grammar exam), students aren't studying the grammar book enough and are taking the ten-question quizzes by the thousands. 

Hall also states that the problems with the Word Association webpage are due to the excessive amount of practice tests and quizzes taken and the limited database potential.

"The problems are occurring because students don't want to study," Hall said.  "The right way to study is to read the grammar book and then see how much you know by taking some practice quizzes, which is exactly the contrary to what students actually do. The result of that is that the system has now exceeded two million practice quizzes taken just by mass communications majors just at FIU. The poor database is just choking to death." 

The computerized exam, which consists of 100 multiple-choice questions within an hour and 30 minute time limit, has been part of the SJMC curriculum for 20 years. 

It is not very popular among many SJMC students, mostly because of the scoring requirements and the $15 fee for each exam. 

"Maybe you do use some of the information you learn by studying for the exam but not a lot and not to the degree where you have to pay for the class, pay for the test and maybe even some students have to pay for tutoring to pass the test," said advertising major, Mary Zumba.

Other students are not only upset that a fee is charged for each exam, but also by the exam score requirements for the journalism classes, which many feel are too high and difficult to achieve.

"I understand that it is necessary for a journalist to have a clear understanding of grammar, but the school should not impose a test with such a high score," said senior and journalism student Carolina Sarassa. "It is sad that many students cannot graduate or move on to other classes because of this test."

Hall admits that the exam is not easy but believes that its level of difficulty is parallel to the grammar knowledge students will need in their professional careers.

"Here we have a reasonable grammar test.  It's not extreme, but its no baby test," Hall said.  "This is a system that really allows the student to learn. The result of it is that our students are being sought after all over the nation, and it's largely to do with the fact that we are, I believe, the only journalism school in the country that attempts to teach language skills to its students."

Some students believe that the exam doesn't prove anything.  

"I don't feel the exam will help students in their professional careers," said advertising major Gino Campodonico.  "I feel like you're more obligated to memorize strategies on how to pass the test than actually retaining the information in your head."  

The administration, on the other hand, feels they cannot emphasize the importance of the grammar exam enough.

"Especially in the communications field, good writing is paramount to getting a job, so that if you don't have writing skills, it will be very hard," Rose said. "What we are trying to do is prepare students for the workforce."   

According to Rose, the $15 fee is necessary in order to keep the grammar exam and the entire system running.  

"The $15 fee is used for the programming and for the software. Also, it is used to maintain the computers in the labs, update the computers, pay for the proctor, etc.  It really does go into the operational costs of the program," Rose said.  "I know the students do not love the $15 fee. If we could do it for less, we would."

Rose explained that the money is also being used to fix the problems with the webpage and that it is difficult to determine when the problems with the webpage will be fixed. 	

"The recent problem with the webpage is a programming problem.  We need to totally reprogram it," she said.  "The programming is costing a fortune right now. Reprogramming the system will take time, and I cannot give a date as to when the problem will be resolved."

Headline: SGA's Cram Jam alleviates stress of final exam week
Author: Katherine Beale / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's finals time again, and all around campus students are starting to pull out their textbooks in anticipation of exam week. 

In the residence halls there are fewer parties and more study sessions as the semester draws to a close. 

The Campus Life departments are doing their part to aid students in the pre-finals crunch.  

At University Park, computer lab hours at the Graham Center will be extended from Dec. 10 - 18.

Some students are extremely enthusiastic about the event.  

"Students get stressed out [with finals]," said Diana Garayar, a freshman majoring in international business. "[The events] will help students relax more and everyone loves free food."

At the Biscayne Bay Campus, Campus Life will have fun activities for students in the Wolfe University Center during Release Week which started Dec. 6 and ends Dec. 9.

On Dec. 6, students enjoyed free massages and stress management tips from Abundant Health Services, a mobile company run by FIU sports medicine alumna Shawnte Wells.

On Dec. 13, students can enjoy a free Midnight Breakfast with games starting at 11 p.m.   

Tiffany Simmons, a student majoring in biology education felt that the events met her needs as a stressed student.

"Yes, it gives me an opportunity to release tension, which I wouldn't have done if these events hadn't been organized," she said.   

Release Week happens every semester at BBC, and Valdelamar is impressed with where the $4,000 budget goes.

Subheadline: Kendall coffee house: an inexpensive place to dine
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coffee houses don't usually to serve food, much less good food, so I was surprised when friends recommended Joffrey's Coffee and Restaurant as an elegant and inexpensive place to dine. 

Located in Kendall, at the former location of the ill-fated Cheeburger Cheeburger (I guess pricey 1 lb. burgers no longer appealed to diners), Joffrey's tends to be lively on Friday and Saturday nights when college students frequent it, many of whom attend FIU and Miami-Dade College. 

However, when I dined there after an overwhelming afternoon of contemporary art at this year's Art Basel, it was empty save for a few diners. This, in addition to the dim lights, warm colors and original artwork (which is for sale à la Cafe Tu Tu Tango) gave it an air of intimacy that evening. If you could imagine a Barista as a waiter, that would describe the service at Joffrey's.

My dining partner and I started out with a hazelnut Italian soda ($2.50) and a pot of Earl Grey tea ($3.25).  The soda was well prepared, with just the right amount of syrup added to the club soda - an interesting and refreshing alternative to more conventional pre-flavored sodas.  

My tea was also very good. However, the teapot was too small, and the teacup, more like a mug, was too big and not properly washed. I got what I deserved for ordering tea at a coffee place, but I'm not too disappointed in these small details.  

After all, it is pretty close to impossible to find someone in this country who knows how to serve tea properly. For many, tea is just watered-down coffee. I was grateful that they had more than Lipton to offer.

A refreshing thing about Joffrey's is that they offer entrees in two sizes, large and small. A small plate of pasta costs anywhere from $6 to $9, while the larger plates cost almost twice as much. Concerned about the sizes, I checked with the waiter who assured us that the small portions were of ample size and that we would need quite a large appetite to finish a large portion. I chose the Chicken Alfredo ($6.95), and my dining partner chose the angel hair with tomato and basil sauce ($6.99). 

We both paid an extra dollar to have the appetizer salads. The salads arrived shortly after we ordered; although they were nothing out of the ordinary, they did use good ingredients that were fresh and crisp, such as romaine lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion slices. 

My salad came with a very standard bleu-cheese dressing, while my dining partner chose a sangria dressing, which was the restaurant's own creation. This was basically a sweet vinaigrette containing red wine vinegar - pleasant and tangy.

The entrees arrived before we were halfway through our salads, which was quite a shame because Alfredo sauce is cream based and has a tendency to thicken quickly, especially when mixed with pasta. When we finally got through with our salads, my Alfredo sauce was nothing more than a thick and creamy coating surrounding an al dente spaghetti. 

My dish was very good despite the fact that it came with spaghetti, which I happen to detest, instead of the linguine that the menu promised.  My dining partner's angel hair, on the other hand, was very well prepared. The sauce tasted very fresh and had an excellent consistency. The herbal, almost liquorice-like quality of fresh basil could be tasted in the sauce. 

The dish also came with a handful of plump black olives that lent a depth of flavor to the dish. Both our dishes came with just the right amount of good quality, freshly-grated Parmesan cheese. This was quite refreshing after being faced with the powdered rubbish at even some higher-end Italian restaurants.

Joffrey's also has a good selection of both traditional and unique desserts.  Being a crème brûlée aficionado, I didn't hesitate to order their version, which came with raspberries ($7.00). Instead of coming in the customary ramekins, it came in a soup bowl. Although it was an interesting (purists would say vulgar) presentation for the dessert, it did mean that it came with more than it would if it had been served traditionally. 

Instead of coming with fresh raspberries or a compote of such, the crème brûlée came with what could be equated to a raspberry butter of which tartness offset the rich flavor of the vanilla custard. The custard was creamy and good. Unfortunately, it was a little too firm and its texture felt as if it were made with gelatin. However, the caramelized sugar on top was perfectly applied - a thin film, just like it's supposed to be.

Joffrey's Coffee and Restaurant is a place where you can spend hours having a conversation over a large variety of good food or good coffee. 

The welcome environment is comfortable and the waitstaff is friendly. On the night we were there, the owner came table-to-table to socialize with patrons. This is definitely a perfect place for a date and an ideal place to have dinner with friends.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The Beacon chooses restaurants at random based on their proximity to the FIU campus and their affordability to students. The restaurant is not informed of the reviewer's affiliation with The Beacon, and the reviewer pays for all the meals.

Subheadline: Kanye West, Usher, Alicia Keys lead Grammy nominations
Author: Jim Abbott / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
New faces of R&B and one of the genre's legends are among the leading nominees for top honors at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.

Innovative rapper Kanye West led the field with 10 nods, followed by R&B singer and MTV sex symbol Usher and soulful singer Alicia Keys with eight each. American icon Ray Charles took seven nominations for his posthumously released "Genius Loves Company."

Usher was expected to lead the nominations announced Tuesday in Los Angeles, so it was surprising to some industry insiders that West managed to slip by him. Usher's "Confessions" has sold more than 7 million copies, roughly three times as many as West's "The College Dropout."

"The biggest surprise is Kanye getting more nods than Usher,'' said Chuck Taylor, managing editor for Billboard Radio Monitor. "That may be a battle cry for rappers to come up with something different than the violence, crime, money and misogyny that has been carrying that genre for years. He made a more thoughtful album, and critics and the public are reacting to that.''

"College Dropout" will vie for best album against the Charles all-star duet album "Genius Loves Company," Green Day's "American Idiot," Keys' "The Diary Of Alicia Keys" and Usher's "Confessions."

Usher, Charles and Green Day also surfaced on the record of the year list: Usher for his collaboration with Ludacris and Lil Jon on "Yeah!''; Charles for his duet with Norah Jones on "Here We Go Again''; and Green Day for "American Idiot's" title track.

Rounding out that category was "Let's Get It Started'' by the Black Eyed Peas and "Heaven'' by Texas-based alt-country group Los Lonely Boys. The group also was nominated for best new artist, in a field against pop-rock band Maroon 5, British teen soul singer Joss Stone, West and country artist Gretchen Wilson.

The nominees for best song category, an award for songwriters, were "Daughters'' (John Mayer); "If I Ain't Got You" (Alicia Keys); "Jesus Walks'' (C. Smith and Kanye West); "Live Like You Were Dying'' (Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman); and Hoobastank's "The Reason'' (Daniel Estrin and Douglas Robb).

In other categories, Wilson's "Here for the Party" is nominated for best country album against Tim McGraw's "Live Like You Were Dying," Tift Merritt's "Tambourine," Keith Urban's "Be Here" and Loretta Lynn's "Van Lear Rose." The latter, produced by White Stripes member Jack White, garnered five nominations for the longtime country star.

Still, Wilson's recognition for "Redneck Woman'' is more significant, says Billboard's Taylor.

"It brought women back to forefront in country radio, and they had been missing for a long time,'' he says. "Plus, it's a great song, something really relatable to people, and it's always nice when the Grammys recognize that.''

Winners will be announced in a live televised ceremony Feb. 13 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles (8 p.m. EST, CBS). 

This year's list of nominees is a diverse yet predictable group that shows the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences sticking to a familiar pattern. The academy has always has had a weakness for top-selling stars and well-established icons, the latter often honored long after defining moments - or even death.

There also were occasional oddities, such as Elvis Costello's darkly country "The Delivery Man" showing up on the rock album list. 

Charles, a 12-time Grammy winner who died in June at age 73, looks to be a strong sentimental favorite. A win also would dovetail nicely with the expected Oscar nomination of Jamie Foxx for his starring role in the hit bio-pic "Ray." 

Beach Boy Brian Wilson also was nominated in the pop vocal album category for "Smile," the retooled version of his long-unreleased 1960s masterpiece. 

Despite his influential work with the Beach Boys, Wilson and that band were ignored until a belated lifetime achievement award in 2001. A win this year for the brilliant "Smile" would be a make-good for that snub. 

Billboard's Taylor says the field is balanced enough that a Norah Jones-style sweep for one of the top nominees might be unlikely. He wouldn't bet against Usher, though.

"I think Usher's going to have a great year at the Grammys and I think he should,'' Taylor says. "He had the best-selling album of 2004 for a reason. He's had a phenomenal year - and he's talented.''
