Headline: Golden Panthers not feeling welcomed at Homecoming game
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Welcome home Chandler Williams and the rest of the 12 players who returned to the field after being suspended for their actions in the brawl at the Orange Bowl.

Everything's exactly like you left it - well, almost: same struggling offense and another wasted effort by the defense.

Welcome home, guys. Feels great, doesn't it?

Unfortunately for Williams and company, their first game back couldn't stop FIU's downward spiral as they lost 17-7 to Louisiana-Lafayette (5-5,2-3) at FIU stadium.

"Well it sounds like a broken record but we had problems with protection again offensively and had opportunities once again, but didn't cash in on them," said coach Don Strock, who announced Nov. 15 that he would not return to the sidelines next season.

Aside from all the negativity that this season has brought, some good news came out of the loss. 

The offense managed to score for the first time in 13 quarters and seven overtimes since the 25-22 loss to North Texas on Oct. 7. 

However, senior quarterback Josh Padrick couldn't replicate his first quarter success in which he completed 6-of-8 passes for 43-yards and a touchdown. 

By the end of the game, and to no surprise, Padrick finished with one touchdown and interception, completing 17-of-31 passes for 137 yards.

The trend this year for the Golden Panthers (0-10, 0-5 Sun Belt) has been to make a play here and then and grab fans interest, only to let them down as quickly with an interception.

"It's frustrating for me being a senior and knowing how the offense can click from previous years from FIU," Williams said.

Among the frustrated seniors is linebacker Keyonvis Bouie, who led the game with 18 tackles (11 of which were solo) and left the game early in the fourth quarter with an MCL sprain in his left knee.

With 6:12 left in the third quarter, he became the all-time leading tackler in history of FIU football when he tackled ULL running back Tyrell Fenroy for a two-yard loss.

Bouie broke John Haritan's record of 295 tackles, which he recorded playing for FIU from 2002-2004. 

"I didn't even know he did that until they announced it. When he heard, he didn't really want to celebrate. He just wanted to get back to playing and that's the thing I like about him," said senior defensive end Antwan Barnes.

Though the Ragin' Cajuns put up 17 points and 345 yards of total offense against a Golden Panthers defense ranked No. 17 in the nation in total defense, you can't blame the defense.

However, you can blame an inept offense that can't run the ball, block a defensive line or catch balls consistently.

In fact, this sputtering offense ranks near the bottom of every offensive category in the nation. 

How is a defense suppose to stay fresh when it's on the field for 36:14 of play?

"If guys can't get up for [the Shula Bowl next week], they don't need to be playing football," said Williams, who finished with seven catches for 77-yards on the night.

The whole team better get back to playing if it wants to avoid being the one of only two winless teams in Division I-A football.

So what else can be expected from the Golden Panthers? 

I guess not much from the way the stands looked. 

Walking into the game, students were tailgating and partying outside of the stadium, but I guess most of them stumbled back into their dorms to finish watching the No. 1 Ohio State defeat No. 2 Michigan 42-39.

One thing's for sure: FIU's offense has been a broken record this season and next year's team will be playing to the tune of a new composer.

Headline: Men's basketball edges out Western Illinois for tournament championship
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coach Sergio Rouco was raving about senior guard Johwen Villegas just minutes after the Golden Panthers hung on for a slim 62-60 win over the Western Illinois Leathernecks at Pharmed Arena Nov. 18.

"He is doing great and he is playing through bad plays," Rouco said. "He knows that I have all the confidence in the world in him and if he makes a mistake, I will leave him out there and he is going to make a play."

With the win, the Golden Panthers won the championship of the FIU Tip-Off Classic and leveled their record at 2-2 on the young season.

Villegas, the tournament's Most Valuable Player, finished with 11 points, four rebounds and two assists. He said he was happy with the effort his team gave.

"We were going through the motions sometimes and in the second half we started playing defense and attacking the boards," he said. "The most important thing is that we were able to get the win and now we have to stay aggressive." 

The Golden Panthers opened the game on a 7-2 run led by junior Dejon Prejean. However, the Leatherbacks had a talented junior of their own in David Jackson, who got them into contention with a series of buckets early on. 

The Leatherbacks pulled with two at 13-11 before Prejean used a crossover dribble to create an easy bucket, which prevented the momentum to shift WIU's way. After splitting the trap defense at mid-court, Prejean finished with a left handed lay up of glass in traffic to give his team much-needed breathing room. 

Unfortunately, the smooth offensive unit that started the game for the Golden Panthers took a hit when sophomore forward Alex Galindo was forced to sit down after picking up three fouls early. With the 6'7" Galindo on the bench, the Golden Panthers lost an added shot blocking threat in the post and the Leatherback guards took advantage right away. 

Jackson continued to be a thorn in the Golden Panthers defense, and his backcourt mate, senior shooting guard Sammy Hunter, penetrated the Golden Panther defense for easy baskets.

After trailing the entire game, Leatherbacks power forward Lorenzo Taylor swished a turnaround ten-footer to give his team their first lead of the game at 24-22. 

Villegas, on the other hand, remained quiet until he put in two consecutive lay-ups to pull the Golden Panthers within four at halftime, 34-30.

Early in the second half, the Leatherbacks appeared poised to open up the lead. Hunter and Jackson continued to shine offensively while their big men manned the paint effectively. 

However, just when WIU got in its comfort zone with a 49-43 lead, the Golden Panthers struck. Forward Facundo Giorgi and Villegas took turns swishing three pointers, sophomore guard Elvis Lora deposited a pair from the charity stripe and Prejean delivered a breakaway dunk to cap off a 10-0 run that gave FIU a 53-49 lead.

The two teams traded baskets the rest of the way. A series of turnovers still gave the Leatherbacks a chance with 5.2 seconds remaining. But fortunately for the Golden Panthers, WIU forward Troy Okeson, who was 3-4 from behind the 3-point line at the time, threw up an air ball in his final attempt as time expired.

Prejean, who was named to the All-Tournament team finished with 15 points and four rebounds in the win.

"This is our house and we have to protect our house. I am just trying to be about the team and trying to help out the seniors," he said. "We just need to work on our rebounding and if we do that we won't have anything to worry about," he added.

Jackson, who also made the all tournament team, led all scorers with 19 points and seven rebounds. Hunter was the only other Leatherback in double figures with 13 points.

In their tournament opener on Nov. 17, the Golden Panthers pulled off a 74-61 victory over Alcorn State. Villegas exploded for 22 points and a career-high 12 rebounds, Prejean had a season high 18 points and Galindo added with 10 points and 8 rebounds.

The Golden Panthers will now look to continue their winning streak as they embark on a four-game road trip, starting Nov. 21 in Tampa against South Florida.

Headline: Ragin' Cajuns spoil FIU's Homecoming
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For coach Don Strock and his FIU team, the end of the season cannot come soon enough.

Even though the Golden Panthers (0-10, 0-5 Sun Belt) ended one streak they continued another Nov. 18 at FIU Stadium as they scored their first touchdown in over a month, but lost for the tenth time this season despite leading to a lowly Louisiana-Lafayette (5-5, 2-3) team that came from behind to win on FIU's Homecoming.

Following a week that saw Strock resign effective at the conclusion of the season, FIU's offense was once again the deciding factor as it was unable to add to an early 7-0 lead.

The Golden Panthers fell despite leading 7-3 at the half and having all players return from the suspensions stemming from the brawl with the University of Miami.

It was a historic night for FIU football not only because they extended the longest losing streak in program history but because linebacker Keyonvis Bouie surpassed John Harritan on the all-time career tackles list with 299.

Bouie was once again a menace on defense, leading all tacklers with 18 stops.

"We played hard defensively but there are areas were we just need to improve," Strock said. "We would make some plays and then we would give up some big plays. It takes a full team effort to win games."

Quarterback Josh Padrick had glimpses of the success he's had past seasons but threw a crucial interception in the fourth quarter that ended the Golden Panther's chances of a comeback.

He finished the night 17 of 31 for 137 yards with a touchdown and the deciding interception.

The rushing game was once again non-existent as sophomores Julian Reams and A'mod Ned combined for 49 yards on just 13 carries.

Chandler Williams led all receivers with seven catches for 77 yards in his first game in almost a month. 

"It sounds like a broken record but we had opportunities that we couldn't cash in on," Strock said.

FIU took a 7-0 lead with 2:49 to play in the first quarter as Padrick topped an eight-play 41-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown pass to fullback John Ellis. 

Drew Edmiston cut the lead to four early in the second quarter. The Lafayette kicker connected on a 47-yard field goal that put the Rajun Cajuns on the board for the first time.

From then on it was the Tyrell Fenroy show. Fenroy finished the night with 172 yards on 34 carries with two deciding touchdowns in the second half. 

The running back gave the visitors the lead with 5:51 to play in the third quarter as he rumbled through the FIU defense and into the endzone from seven yards out.

The Cajun's back then capped off his night late in the fourth quarter with a two-yard touchdown with just 3:30 to play, putting to rest any hopes of an FIU comeback.

ULL quarterback Jerry Babb had a quiet night, completing just seven of 16 passes for 76 yards and an interception. 

Jeremiah Weatherspoon intercepted a poor pass in the first quarter that led to the only Golden Panther points of the night.

Linebacker Alexander Bostic III and defensive end Antwan Barnes joined Bouie in double figures with 14 and 11 tackles respectively.

FIU came into the game leading the nation in tackles for a loss and extended that streak managing to bring down the Cajuns behind the line of scrimmage eight times.

The Golden Panthers now have two more chances to find a win as they face rivals FAU Nov. 25 at Dolphins Stadium before ending their season at home against conference leaders Troy Dec. 2.

Headline: HALL OF FAMERS: Inaugural class inducted into Athletic Hall of Fame
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Graham Center Ballroom was full  of co-workers, old friends and five people whose names are now linked by blue blazers and honorary plaques. The Inaugural FIU Athletics Hall of Fame honored Dr. Judith Blucker, Pat Bradley, Mike Lowell, Andrea Nagy-Rowe and Dwight Stewart for setting precedents in FIU athletics in their respective fields.

Blucker was the catalyst for FIU women's athletics in 1972, which was also the University's inaugural year.

"The older you get, the more you realize that life's journey is full of highs and lows. I must tell you that this recognition tonight is definitely one of the highest highs for me," Blucker said.

When Blucker arrived at FIU there were no intercollegiate women's teams. Blucker helped establish the women's volleyball, softball and golf teams. Women's volleyball enjoyed early success, despite practicing in dismal conditions.

"All of our practices had to be in what we called the famous Tim Gym. It was one of the old airport hangars. It had concrete floors and resident pigeons dropping poop on the floor," Blucker said.

Blucker was also the academic adviser, athletic adviser and professor to inductee Bradley (1972-74), who is one of the 23 members in the LPGA Hall of Fame. When she arrived at FIU in 1972, she was the only player on the golf team.

"It was just me," Bradley said. "We had no team. I went to golf tournaments, but I couldn't high-five anybody else."

Bradley attended Miami-Dade North for two years and then transferred to a school on the west coast. She spent one short semester there before returning to New England to play summer golf.

She had missed one semester and was on the verge of missing another when Mary Dagerot, the women's golf coach at FIU and her former coach at Miami-Dade, called her about an opportunity to continue her education at a brand new university in South Florida.

"I'm saying to myself 'God in Heaven, you've sent me an angel,' because I did not know what I was gong to do," Bradley said. "And I knew if I didn't get back to school soon, I may never get back."

During her senior year at FIU, Bradely was informed that her semester out west was considered a full year of golf and she was no longer eligible to play.

Bradley sat down with her Blucker about her golf ineligibility.

Her adviser informed her that the LPGA tour was having their qualifying school at Kendale Lakes. The result was a 30-year LPGA career in which she won 31 tournaments, including six majors.

Lowell (1993-95), a current member of the Boston Red Sox, was a Collegiate Baseball Freshman All-American in 1993, a three-time All-Trans America Athletic Conference selection, the League's Student-Athlete of the Year and an Academic All-American in 1995.

Professionally, Lowell is a three-time MLB All-Star and Gold Glove winner. He was a member of the 2003 World Champion Florida Marlins.

During High School, Lowell transferred from Columbus High School to Coral Gables High because his coach at Columbus said he wasn't good enough to play at the High School level.

"I sent him a personal invitation to the event, but I think he declined," said Lowell.

Danny Price, current FIU baseball coach of 26 years, offered Lowell a scholarship during his senior year, but did not contact Lowell for 8 weeks.

"I remember talking to my dad saying, 'You think they still got that scholarship out on the table?'" Lowell said. His father called Price, who assured him that the scholarship was still on the table.

"That was the first dose of being honest and showing respect that I felt came from the University," Lowell said.

During his freshman year at FIU, Lowell was struggling and Price told him to relax.

According to Price, he has never seen a player put so much pressure on himself.

"My biggest problem sometimes is that I expect so much from myself that I think I take away the joy from baseball," Lowell said. "I owe a lot of putting the joy back into baseball during my college years to coach Price."

Andrea Nagy-Rowe (1991-1995) is one of three FIU women's basketball players to have their jersey retired.

Her 9.4 assist-per-game average is fourth-best in NCAA history and her 1,136 assists ranks second best in NCAA history

Nagy-Rowe played professionally for seven years, including stints in the WNBA with the Washington Mystics, New York Liberty and Sacramento Monarchs.

Nagy-Rowe came over from Hungary in 1991 not knowing English too well, but was welcomed to FIU by people she would build strong relationships the next four years, her teammates.

"When I arrived, I found my first real friends right here on the FIU Basketball court," Nagy-Rowe said. "The years passed, my English improved and the team became like a second family to me as I forged friendships that would last a lifetime."

Dwight Stewart (1988-93) is the most prolific scorer in FIU men's basketball history and the only player to reach 2,000 points.

He has sole possession of 30 school records and co-holder of five others.

He is the only player to have his jersey retired. He missed only one collegiate game and led his team to a TAAC regular-season championship in 1992-93.

Stewart acknowledged his parents' devotion to him as they attended every single game he played since he was 8 years old.

"Words can't express the gratitude that I have for these two people," said Stewart. "They have given me everything I need to be a successful person in life."

Rich Walker, FIU's first head basketball coach, recruited Stewart and told him he had a chance to make history at FIU.

"Low and behold I'm right here in the Hall of Fame," Stewart said.

Headline: Football program in need of new blood
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
We all saw it coming.

FIU head football coach Don Strock announced his resignation Nov. 15 and fans and alumni are breathing a little easier. Many are now looking forward to the change in direction a new coach will bring to the program, especially on the offensive side.

Granted, Strock built the program from the ground up, but he isn't the man fit to take the Golden Panthers to the next level. It's time for some fresh blood. His offense and his recruiting strategies may have worked at the Division I-AA level, but this season's winless record shows it may not work in Division I-A.

Strock was building a losing culture in which fans didn't expect much from the team.

Even though he made NCAA history after FIU's quick jump to Division I-A in 2005, it just wasn't enough to save his job.

We live in a society where people hold a "What have you done for me lately?" attitude.

What the team has done lately is go 0-10 this season; brawl with the University of Miami; get 16 players suspended indefinitely; rank the nation's lowest in almost every offensive category; and given games away they should have won.

As soon as Athletic Director Pete Garcia arrived on the scene, it was apparent that Strock wasn't going to be in his plans of reconstructing FIU athletics.

The question becomes who is going to be the next football coach. Names are being thrown around message boards as if it were a cafeteria food fight: UM defensive coordinator Randy Shannon (father of sophomore center Xavier); FIU defensive coordinator Kevin Fouquier; San Diego Chargers tight ends coach Rob Chudzinski; and University of Georgia defensive coordinator Willie Martinez. All these candidates, except for Fouquier, have ties to South Florida and have either played or coached at UM, Garcia's previous employer.

Regardless of who becomes the next FIU coach, a new football philosophy cannot make the program any worse than it is now.

Headline: LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Some inconsistencies found in Luna Cafe story
Author: Laura McDermott / Event Coordinator
&nbsp;
I really want to thank you for covering the Luna Star Cafe in your article  "Cafe offers relaxed ambiance, artistic expression" and also for the mention of my reading series, the Literary Salon and the Gulf Stream Reading, for which I am also an editor. I also think it is wonderful that your article wasn't narrowed in solely to the literati. Alexis Sanfield, the owner, does so much to reach all demographics with her establishment.

However, I'd like to point out that there were quite a few inconsistencies within the article written by Alexandra McAnarney. Ms. McAnarney makes mention that I wasn't available for a comment, but I was never contacted in order to make myself available. Being that I am affiliated with the cafe, the reading series, and the literary magazine, I wish someone had attempted to contact me for some of the inconsistencies I am about to mention. For the last cover story done by The Beacon, I readily worked with the editor in covering the story accurately.

Ms. McAnarney states in the article, "Joe Mailin, a creative writing graduate student, read short excerpts of prose from FIU's literary magazine, Gulf Stream, Nov. 9." I have not met a Mr. Mailin in the writing program, and none of the readers who presented are current MFA students. It is a policy of Gulf Stream to not publish students within the MFA program. The male readers for the evening were Don Burns, Leonard Nash, and the female readers were Haya Pomrenze and C.M. Clark. Our fiction editor is named Joe, but he neither read nor has the surname of Mailin.

Again, your covering the Luna Star Cafe is great! People really need to know of the great treasure that lies on NE 125 St.

Headline: Missing votes expose flaw in voter system
Author: Jose Pagliery / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With 18,382 votes missing in Sarasota County's District 13, the Florida Legislature has found itself out of excuses for rejecting a system of paper trails for electronic voting machines, which is both required and more accurate. Although Florida Secretary of State Sue M. Cobb will be sending in a team of investigators to supervise the recount and audit the systems, this move will serve little more than to quell the questioning and provide for political photo opportunities. 

While Direct Recording Electronic systems are required by law to provide auditors with a paper trail, they do not provide a receipt for every voter. This creates a problem for auditors, who can only count the final total of all the votes instead of "recounting" each individual one. Why send a team to recount a tally that can't be double-checked and audit a procedure that can't be examined? 

By sending in a useless team of auditors and drawing attention to Sarasota's voting discrepancy, Florida Legislature may soon reveal one of their biggest mistakes. 

Florida Legislature has argued that using only DRE systems protects a voter's identity, but how can a nameless receipt be identified? 

If voters drop their paper vote into a closed ballot box, they maitain the right to privacy and the guarantee that a recount will serve as more than simply a reprint of systematic flaws.  Without proof of accurate voting procedures, the democratic process is being threatened. 

The Florida Legislature argues that relying on DRE systems speeds up the process. But as of November, dysfunctional DRE systems have slowed down every election in which they have been used. If each machine provided a voter with a receipt, dealing with a malfunctioning machine would only entail checking the precinct's paper votes. In all cases, accuracy takes precedence over speed. Since speed is not an issue when it comes to accuracy, for DRE systems, it's also a lame defense. 

Florida's electronic voting machines are provided by the Diebold corporation and cannot be hacked into by outsiders, but a recent study conducted by Princeton's Center for Informational Technology Policy has shown that "an attacker who gets physical access to a machine [could create a] malicious code…that could steal votes undetectably." Having a paper trail would uncover any major inconsistencies between a machine's count and a hand count. Having double the proof could not be wrong unless there is something to hide.

CorpWatch, the independent investigative organization behind the initial investigations of the Enron Corporation and Halliburton Energy Services, reported that "Diebold and its executives have contributed some $409,170 to Republican candidates and the Republican National Committee since 2001, while contributing only $2,500 to Democrats in the same time frame." 

While a DRE system already costs the state an average of about $3,000 per machine, a printout service would cost the state little more. Diebold DRE systems with individual printers cost San Diego County $3,040 each - only $40 more than what Florida has paid for each machine. 

If our state refuses to pay for the minute difference in price, it will continue to find itself plagued by Sarasota-type debacles that cost it something much more valuable: the trust of the voters whom our democracy rests on.

Headline: FOOTBALL COACH STROCK RESIGNS: Team members surprised, saddened by coach's departure
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Defensive end Justin West, a freshman, had no idea he'd be playing under two different football coaches when he began FIU this year. After current head coach Don Stock resigned Nov. 15, this realization came as a shock to West.

"It took all of us by surprise," West said. "This is the same guy who gave me a scholarship."

With less than a year in the football program, West had little time to fully know what his soon-to-be former head coach was like.

"He kept to himself, but he was cool to talk to," West said.

Strock said he will finish out the season, which has been marred by a winless record and the infamous brawl with the University of Miami.

Strock addressed the media at practice Nov. 16 on an overcast day and talked about his reasoning behind the decision.

"I put a lot of hard work into this team, but there's a lot of changes going on in the University right now and I felt it was the right thing to do," Strock said.

Senior quarterback Josh Padrick, who arrived on the team prior to the inaugural 2002 season, shared the same sentiment as most of his teammates.

"My first thought was sadness," Padrick said. "He brought me here and gave me a scholarship and I'm sad to see him go."

Strock was named director of football operations in 1999 and was responsible for obtaining approval for a football program from the Florida Board of Regents. He saw his wish fulfilled May of 2000.

On Sept. 13, 2000, Strock was named head football coach by former athletic director Rick Mello.

"Building a football program from the ground is a difficult and daunting task and Don put everything he had into it," Mello said.

Strock, 55, was a popular figure in South Florida before coming to the University, serving as a backup quarterback to the Miami Dolphins from 1974-1987.

Strock, who was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1973 NFL Draft, is best known for his role in a Dolphins playoff game against the San Diego Chargers in 1982.

With the Dolphins trailing 24-0, Strock entered the game and proceeded to lead the team back only to come up short and lose 41-38 in overtime. The game was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history and is the only playoff game in which two quarterbacks threw for over 400 yards - Strock with 408 and the Chargers' Dan Fouts with 448. Many sports pundits have christened the game "The Epic in Miami." 

Strock was a collegiate quarterback at Virginia Tech, where he holds the school record for career passing yards, as well as the record for passing yards single season and in a single game. He was elected into his alma mater's Hall of Fame in 1985.

Strock began his coaching career in 1993 with the Miami Hooters of the Arena Football League. He then moved across the league to head the Massachusetts Marauders. In 1995, Strock was offensive coordinator and quarterback coach of the Rhein Fire of the World League.

At FIU, Strock has compiled a 15-39 record in five seasons. Under him, the football program made the fastest transition from Division I-AA to Division I-A in NCAA history and joined the Sun Belt Conference.

He was named Sun Belt Conference Coach of the Year in 2005 after his team finished the season with three consecutive victories.

"We've done a good job in getting this team to the right direction," Strock said. "It's been one of the biggest challenges I've ever had."

Strock plans to spend more time with his wife, who had been taking care of her ailing mother before she for the last three months. His mother-in-law recently passed away.

Athletic Director Pete Garcia would not comment on Strock's resignation or the future of the program, but said he might make an announcement in a couple of weeks. 

As of press time, the University has no candidates for the next head coach.

Headline: Funds being raised for new scholarship
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students who are the first in their family to attend college but may not have the necessary financial aid may soon count on the the First Generation Grant Program, the first of its kind in Florida.

"First generation means neither of your parents received a bachelors degree anywhere in the world," said Fabiola Ortega, a loan coordinator in the financial aid office.

Besides the first generation requirement, there are three other basic rules for students to become eligible for the new grant. 

Students must qualify as a Florida resident for financial aid. They must be seeking an undergraduate degree and be enrolled at a university for a minimum of six credit hours per term. Lastly, students must have shown financial need by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The scholarship will be go to members of the incoming class. 

The Florida Legislature has put aside $6.5 million for the First Generation Fund, in a dollar-for-dollar matching program. Of the $6.5 million, FIU could receive up to $800,000 in matching funds. The rest of the $6.5 million will be dispersed to other universities who are raising funds for the same program.

That's if FIU can raise $800,000 by Nov. 30. For exampe, if FIU only raises $500,000 by that date, the fund will only receive $500,000 from the state.

At FIU more than 270 students qualify for the new scholarship and their total need is $1.8 million, according to the Office of Advancement. Due to this need, the students of the Honors College have been raising funds for the First Generation Scholarship fund.

"We decided as a group to collect funds for this new scholarship," said Sofia Cueto, a student ambassador for the Honors College "As far as I know, we are the only student led initiative raising money for the First Generation Scholarship."

Katherine Chapman, also an ambassador, said that raising funds for a scholarship of this nature ties into what the Honors College is all about. 

"A lot of the Honors College students are here on a scholarship," Chapman said. "At first we only talked to Honors College students to collect money, but now we are accepting donations from anyone."

The students hope to have as much money raised as possible by Nov. 27.

"I don't have any exact counts yet, but I have been getting good feedback," Chapman said. 

Although it is not certain if FIU will reach the $800,000 fundraising goal, current first generation freshmen are excited about the new scholarship.

"It would be a great help," said freshman Francesca Corea. "There was a screw up in high school, so I'm not receiving any scholarships."

Other hopeful freshmen feel that a new scholarship would help alleviate the pressure they receive from their parents to succeed at FIU.

"My parents don't have a lot of money to spare," said freshman Salvatore Valenziano. "They are so proud of me and that puts a lot of indirect pressure on me."

Headline: Emotions flare at Faculty Senate meeting
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
The Faculty Senate spent most of its Nov. 14 meeting discussing the recent dispute between University President Modesto A. Maidique and donor Dr. Herbert Wertheim.

When Maidique arrived toward the end of the meeting to give his Fall 2006 report to the senate, a tense discussion ensued.

Maidique's controversial dispute resulted in Wertheim withdrawing a $20 million donation to the FIU College of Medicine and resigning from his position on the Board of Trustees.

The meeting began with some angry remarks about Maidique's role in the discussion. Some of the strongest remarks came from Philip Stoddard of the biology department, for whom the discussion with Wertheim represents only one more in a long list of grievances against Maidique.

"I've got no confidence in the man, and if we had a motion for a vote of no confidence, I would second it," Stoddard said.

Others were more tempered in their indictment of the FIU president. 

"It's true that Maidique has gotten himself into a poor situation," said Grover Larkins of the electrical and computer engineering department. "We should hear what he has to say. I don't know whether I'd agree with him but we are where we are and he has a lot to do with it."

Most of the discussion revolved around Wertheim and his departure from the board. 

"We lost a trustee who is probably the only friend the faculty had on that board," said Dev Roy of the mathematics department. 

This sentiment was by no means unanimous.

According to Faculty Senate Chairman Bruce Hauptli, who is also a board member, Wertheim demanded to be the chairman of the search and screen committee for the founding dean of the College of Medicine.

When Maidique responded that it would be unethical for a trustee and donor to chair such a committee, Wertheim went to the board's chair, David Parker, to intercede.

Wertheim eventually became the committee's vice chairman.

Moreover, said Hauptli, Wertheim should have consulted with his lawyers and accountants before, not after, signing the $20 million contract.

Ultimately, the senate voted in favor of sending Wertheim a letter thanking him for his service to the University.

"I don't want to make him a hero, but I do want to give him his due, because he did not do this 'on the cheap' as Maidique accused him of doing," said Joan Baker of the English department.

However, once Maidique arrived and invited the senate to ask him questions faculty members were more reticent with their opinions.

Secretary Howard Rock broke the silence, asking Maidique to explain his handling of the dispute.

"I consulted with the other members of the board and no one wanted [Wertheim to disburse his donation over time]. There was a contract, and it wasn't adhered to," Maidique said.

According to Maidique, Wertheim's financial commitment was the result of three hours of negotiation, after which the BOT's determined that Wertheim could secure the naming rights for the new college only if he made the donation "immediately, in cold, hard cash."

Receiving the money over time would have presented a monetary loss to the University, Maidique argued, because if it received the entire donation at once, the University could begin making interest on the $20 million.

Stoddard rejected Maidique's explanation, saying that he attended the BOT's meeting in which the donation was negotiated. Contrary to Maidique's account, the stipulation that the donation must be given immediately never came up.

Stoddard also questioned whether Maidique's actions were based on a general consensus among board members.

"If everyone on the board feels this way, why has the Board of Trustees stayed silent?" Stoddard asked.

Maidique responded that the BOT chair gave a statement, which represented the entire board.

Stoddard also asked whether Maidique felt that he had treated Wertheim appropriately on a "personal level."

"For me, it was strictly business. We have a contract and this is what the contract says," Maidique said.

He also denied that FIU General Counsel Christina Mendoza sent Wertheim a letter saying that if he made his donation over time, he needed to give $5 million over 8 years for a total of $40 million.

Brian Peterson of the history department said that, even as a business decision, Maidique's actions were wrong.

"Even if we get the money all at once, it might cost us more in donations from bad publicity. What kind of impression is the school giving with this shabby treatment of donors? If this is how we treat our benefactors, who wants to be associated with a place like this," Peterson asked.

Maidique claimed that, while no one has yet contacted the University with criticism about the dispute, donors have called him supporting his decision.

Maidique also talked about finding another donor to replace Wertheim.

He said John Rock, who will be the College of Medicine's founding dean, wants to appoint five "superstar chairs" and that in order to do that, FIU needs more than Wertheim's $20 million. 

According to Maidique, the naming rights for a medical school usually range from $30 million to $250 million.

"We'll wait until we get a huge donor, and I'm confident that we'll get several. I feel comfortable saying that getting the naming rights for our medical school is the biggest honor in the city of Miami," Maidique said.

Headline: How To...a Humor Column: Holiday season brings out the good in ungrateful wench
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
From the minute I opened up my first box of Crayolas, my favorite color has been red. With the exception of sun-charred skin and ugly leather jackets from the '80s, red looks good on everything. 

My mom has known me for 22 years, give or take, and one would expect she would understand my affinity for crimson hues.

I came home the other day to find a package on my doorstep with an invoice that stated baby blue sweater in my size. It was pre-gift wrapped.

Baby blue to those who love red is chromatic kryptonite. It actually makes you feel weak to wear it. I was so enraged I was very close to making a holiday protest and writing, "Return to crappy sender" on the box.

To give thanks is not easy. It requires being satisfied with what you're given. The mental and emotional uncertainty of your late teens and early 20s barely allows room for that. You grow up to want salary vs. hourly, video vs. camera phone, and know eventually your lease with this boyfriend will expire. To upgrade is life.

At one point, and usually around this time of year, you need to repent. It's ironic that a desire to be non-materialistic comes during the busiest shopping quarter of the year. However, we've got to try. Those constantly happy monks with three blades of grass to their names must be doing something right, right? 

Here's a guide to getting through your holiday season as close to the season's intent as possible:



The wind-up



The holiday season officially kicks off with Thanksgiving. This is a great opportunity to practice hanging out with family members before the drunken atrocity that is Noche Buena. It's more than likely you'll be getting the same "catching up" questions both times, as the relatives will be too drunk to remember they asked the first time. A good way to prepare yourself is to hang out with your sick cat - whiney meows and sporadic vomit are things Whiskers and Tia Lourdes have in common. 



The pitch



Now that you've practiced responses to "Ah, still no boyfriend?" and "I thought FIU was a four-year school," you can focus on setting an example for the inevitable gift exchange.

Instead of gift baskets from Hickory Farms or gift certificates to Best Buy, you may want to try giving to a charitable organization. PETA and St. Jude's Foundation are a good way to go. Just be prepared to answer to your abuelita when she asks, "Y que es el N-doble-A-C-P?"



Home run (or home free)



Once the gifts have been distributed and the looks of delight and/or horror have subsided, you can explain your actions. Stand on your soapbox proudly and declare how the season is about giving. Drop the word "Jesus" in there for Holiday street cred. 

Just know that it is more likely for Jesus to come down and give you a high-five than to have anyone listen to you. Plus, kiss any future expensive gifts goodbye. Then again, who cares?  You still did the right thing, and being morally superior to your family is what the holidays are all about.

In college, we are taught to be "critical thinkers" ­- questioning what has been accepted as unexamined truth during our entire young lives. Mundane routines and everyday hassles turn critical thinking into criticism, which yields to cynicism. Too much of that and you've got ungratefulness, which results in straight up bitterness and feeding your 22 cats from your leftover "soup for one" packages.

With that said, I know come Christmas morning, I'll wear my ugly blue sweater with pride. I've got a donation for National Starving Artists ready, anyway.

Good luck.

Headline: Back in BLACK: Miami mallrats prepare for holiday shopping frenzy
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
After helping hundreds of customers purchase their new Sony PlayStation 3 videogame systems on Nov. 17, sophomore Georgina Reyes, a Best Buy sales associate, is tired from spending hours dealing with long lines. Nevertheless, she will have to deal with much worse on the day after Thanksgiving, also known as "Black Friday, " one of the busiest shopping days of the year. 

For Reyes, this Black Friday will be her first as a sales associate.

"I've done Black Friday before, but only as a shopper," she said. "This is going to be a new experience for me because I'm on the other side of the cash register this time."

According to About.com, the term "Black Friday" originated from the shift in profitability that retailers experience once holiday shopping begins; retailers go from being "in the red, " indicating loss, to "in the black," which signifies profit.

However, some students such as junior Mohammed Oosman have their own theories about the unofficial "holiday."

"The day is called Black Friday because of the chaos that ensues from long lines and short tempers," he said. "Also, I think days in history that have had huge financial impact are called 'black,' such as the Wall Street crash that happened in the 1920s."

In 2005, shoppers spent $27.8 billion on Black Friday weekend, when more than 145 million shoppers purchased merchandise from both brick-and-mortar stores as well as internet retailers. These statistics from the National Retail Federation's website www.nrf.com show an increase in profits from the 2004 Black Friday weekend, when shoppers spent $22.8 billion.

Black Friday can either make or break a company's fiscal quarter, according to Reyes.

"This one day is when we make tons of profit," she said. "If things go well, we'll meet our projections for this quarter. If things don't go well, we probably won't."

Because stores traditionally open earlier than usual on Black Friday, eager consumers such as Oosman have already made preparations for the Nov. 24 shopping day ­­- he doesn't plan on getting a good night's sleep on Thanksgiving. 

"My family and I already have things planned out for Friday," Oosman said. "I probably won't get any sleep and I'll be at Best Buy really early because the store opens around five or six in the morning. We'll most likely camp out in front of the store with everyone else."

Consumers are also preparing by viewing Black Friday advertisements online. Traditionally, ads for Black Friday aren't released until Thanksgiving, when they are circulated in newspapers and posted on the stores' websites. However, crafty insiders have already uploaded scans of these ads onto websites such as bfads.net and fatwallet.com

Retailers such as Wal-Mart have recently taken steps toward limiting premature availability of their post-Thanksgiving sales. According to a CNNMoney.com article dated Nov. 15, Wal-Mart is aware that its Black Friday ads have already leaked and is planning on hiding other deals until Thanksgiving, when the discounts will be posted on the company website. Other retailers such as Linens 'n Things have taken more drastic measures, including sending cease-and-desist orders to certain websites, according to the article.

Junior Ameer Juman doesn't understand why stores are so aggressive about preventing their ads from being released before their scheduled date.

"I usually check out those websites before Black Friday, and they help me plan accordingly," he said. "It's confusing to me why stores would try to stop this kind of thing if it helps the consumers figure out what they want beforehand so they go withdraw money from their bank accounts sooner than later." 

Despite the various sales available solely on Nov. 24, freshman Marea Perea will be staying home.

"I don't plan on going out that day because the lines will be way too long, and people are going to be overly aggressive," Perea said. "I've done it before, and once is enough."

USSA president discusses financial aid cuts with SGC-BBC

Jennifer Pae, president for USSA, the recognized voice for students on Capitol Hill, met with the Student Government Council at BBC Nov. 15 in WUC 159, to discuss the events at Capitol Hill.

Pae, who was elected to serve as president in August, talked about the financial cuts the federal government has been making and it's effect on students.

"Over 400,000 high school and community college students forgo college because they can't afford it," Pae said.

According to Pae, the federal government has been cutting back on programs such as Gear up and Upward Bound, which are designed to aid students.

"USSA was a large part of how Gear Up got created. [It helped] students who thought they would've never ever been able to go to school," said Pae.

Headline: Bookstore's holiday food drive lacks participation
Author: Carla St. Louis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Despite the holiday season, the Biscayne Bay Campus Bookstore has received a lukewarm response to its inaugural food donation drive.

 "[It's] unfortunate that we received such a low turn-out considering the benefits one earns from participating in charitable causes," said Scott Cohen, assistant bookstore manager.

Erica Garvey, the Bookstore's manager, and her staff began the food drive at the beginning of the month.

The Bookstore worked with the Faith Church of Ft. Lauderdale to distribute the collected items to disadvantaged individuals at two youth centers: Covenant House and Teen Challenge.

 Cohen and Audrey Wilson, the Bookstore's textbook supervisor, advertised the drive on e-mails and posters, but donations still remain scarce.

"FIU has such a large pool of students; I expected a higher influx of student contributors," Garvey said.

She said that one of the main reasons she established this drive was to benefit FIU students. 

"Community involvement is a great way to prepare students for the harsh realities of the world," she said.

"[We] wanted to foster goodwill within them."

Despite Garvey and her employees' efforts to publicize the charity drive, many FIU students still did not know about it.

Roldy Blot, a student majoring in biology, said that she has visited the bookstore and received no information about the drive.

"I was completely unaware of the BBC Bookstore's charity," Blot said.

Nakeia Calvert, also majoring in biology, expressed the same sentiments.

 "I actually was informed about this yesterday, but I am still unclear as to the event's purpose," he said.

Cohen and his co-workers still remain optimistic that donations will pick up, and are considering plans of holding a similar drive in the future.

"We'd like to establish a similar event for the holiday season," Cohen said.

Established in 1972, Covenant House aids at least 76,000 youths annually with services such as substance abuse treatment, family crisis intervention, legal services and outreach programs.

It distinguishes itself from other shelters by providing its attendees with educational resources and vocational training programs.

With nearly 50 years of experience, Teen Challenge is an organization that helps youths battling substance addiction and alcohol dependency.

Participants are placed in an environment that helps them find independence from drug and alcohol abuse through counseling, therapy, housing, safeguarding and preventive curriculums.

Covenant House and Teen Challenge receive their supplies, which include clothing, food, money and housing, through donations from churches, corporations, universities and community groups.

Headline: Homecoming inspires nostalgia
Author: Ever Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
High School was the last time I ever went to a homecoming dance. 

This was my junior year and my first time ever attending a major university event.

To be honest, I've never been the school spirit type. Like a number of my fellow students, I never cared for school activities. I also never expected to ever go to another homecoming.

My journey into the world of school spirit began Nov. 15, when I attended my first ever University pep rally/block party.

The pep rally was for the FIU vs. Lafayette football game. The  Hospitality Management Patio overlooked the bay and the night was cool and breezy, not humid at all.

The smell of free hamburgers, cheeseburgers and hot dogs floated in the air.  

The snow cones looked like watered down fruit juice.

Around 10:30 p.m. the pep rally/block party switched gears. Hip-hop music blasted loudly through the deejay's sound system and students kept on coming.

 I was a little uncomfortable until I saw some people I recognized.

I was reminded of high school as I watched the students dance. 

Most girls danced, while the guys just stared and stood like wallflowers. The guys were on one side, girls on the other and neither seemed interested in asking the other to dance.

The following day was the big night: the Homecoming dance.

I felt as nervous as I did in high school. The only things that differed is the amount of pressure.

 The college atmosphere is more relaxed than the uncertainty and peer pressure of my high school years.

 I did come in contact with a few minor obstacles.

Namely, I wasn't sure what to wear and my date also stood me up because apparently she was "feeling very sick," another reminder of my distant high school days where I also had no date.

I arrived around 9:45 p.m.

The ballroom was dimly lit. Tables were decorated with yellow table cloths and blue chairs.

On top of every table was a frozen, oval-shaped bouquet of white roses. Red, blue, and green lights circled around, lighting the dance floor.

Instead of dinner I helped myself to the sugar coated ladyfingers, graham crackers, the delicious vanilla wafers and the chocolate crème with the vanilla outside Oreos that lined the dessert tray.

It was interesting to see the University through a different angle.

I saw it through the eyes of the Student Programming Council, the Student Government Association and all the school spirited students.

I saw my fellow classmates enjoying themselves and they all looked very satisfied and proud to partake in these events.

Students really dressed to impress. 

Ladies were dressed elegantly with long gowns running the gamut of  shades: red, black and white. 

Black suits, cream colored suits and  all white suits.  Each tried to complement their dates' dresses. 

One student donned a "pimp suit" and matching hat.

I also noticed the large amount of dateless guys like me.

Women dancing by themselves never seems odd. What does is a group of guys dancing by themselves.

It was midnight now and some students started leaving, but the dance floor still did not let up.

Did I dance? No. I had no date but I hung out with a couple of friends. 

This experience taught me that our University is like a second home to us. It is something we should be proud of. I can't wait until next year's homecoming.
