Headline: Terri Schiavo
Subheadline:  
Author: grace-perce@cfl.rr.com
&nbsp;
As a Florida Resident, I am deeply disturbed with the Terri Schiavo case.  Any man or woman that commits adultery while legally married to an incapacitated spouse, as Michael Schiavo has for over 10 years, should never be granted legal guardianship of the incapacitated spouse, especially with the judicial courts' full knowledge that the incapacitated spouse has a loving and caring family support system that is more than willing to be responsible for the incapacitated person's care.  Judge Greer's action to grant legal guardianship to Michael Schiavo is truly an insult to all married women in this country given that Michael and his "new wife and children" of over 10 years would never welcome Terri into "Michael's new family nucleus".  I find it truly absurd that Michael continues to refer to Terri as his "wife" given the existence of his "new wife and children" that he fails to acknowledge time and time again in his TV and public appearances.  I'm sure if Terri knew of "Michael's new family" she would equivocally disagree with having the court system appoint Michael as her legal guardian.  Why can't the judicial system, especially Judge Greer, acknowledge that Michael Schiavo's legal guardianship is truly a conflict of interest? 
 
Furthermore, it is truly alarming that any judge would rule in favor of someone's death based on pure verbal "he-said / she-said" testimony presented by only one other person (such as Michael) and in the absence of other witnesses?  If Michael is truly concerned in fulfilling "Terri's wish to die if ever incapacitated", why did he not execute her wishes within the first 3 years after her initial tragedy?  Why wasn't Michael as adamant then about executing her wish as he is today?

Lastly, why haven't the courts fully reviewed Michael's spending of the $1M settlement he received...i.e., financing his nursing education, caring for his "new family", and wastefully spending the balance (Terri's possible rehabilitation funds) on litigation to fight the Schlinder's whose only downfall is to care for their daughter?  
 
 I understand that the courts have to be extremely careful not to set a legal precedent based on this case but why can't the court system admit that Michael's new family is truly a conflict for interest for Michael to serve as a legal guardian for Terri and why has the court system not probed further into Michael's spending of the $1M settlement? I'd be curious to see what percentage of these funds Michael has spent towards the care of his "Wife Terri", given that he is her legal guardian, versus for the care of his "new family interests".

I hope our Justice system truly gives Terri Schiavo and her family the true justice they deserve.  No American should be denied food or water unless it is absolutely certain that the person being denied these rights has granted their wish in writing and with witnesses present.  If we afford these rights to every convicted criminal in this country why cant' we afford the same for Terri Schiavo?

Sincerely,
Grace Pierce

Hello! My name is Melissa Gaviria, I am writing on behalf of the Relay for Life committee. I am aware that there was story written about Relay for Life a few months ago and I would like to know if it was possible to mention in the next edition of the Beacon that the Relay for Life is coming up next weekend at FIU. It starts April 1st at 6 pm and it lasts all night until the the next day at 10 am. It is going to be in the GC lawn area and in case some readers aren't aware of what the Relay for Life is, it is a nation wide event from the American Cancer Society that happens every year to honor cancer survivors and raise money in hopes of finding a cure. Thank you very much and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Headline: Hitting left-handed sparks success for Murray
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Thanks in large part to slugging outfielder Deomni Murray, the Golden Panther softball team has kicked off the 2005 campaign with a winning 15-9 record.

Despite batting right-handed her entire life, Murray switched to bat from the left side of the plate at the start of her collegiate level in order to compensate for her speed. 

Coach Kim Gwyder wanted Murray to use the running slap technique, where she would be able to slap the ball and have a shorter gap between home and first base.  The results you may ask - a staggering team-leading .351 batting average.

"That is just the kind of person she is,"  said Murray's teammate and current roommate, Brittany Witherow. "Her presence on the field makes her unique.  She never seems to panic and always keeps a cool head."

After completing the first 24 games of the regular season, Murray, from Lakewood, Fla., who is majoring in broadcast journalism, sat down with The Beacon to discuss softball, brothers and life.

Q. When you're not playing softball, what are your favorite things to do in your spare time?

I definitely like to sleep!  But when I'm not doing that, I go shopping.  I'm really into tennis shoes.

Q. Who is your favorite baseball player?

[Atlanta Braves center fielder] Andrew Jones.  He's really cute (Giggles.)  He's also a really good outfielder.

Q. What is your favorite food?

Macaroni and cheese!

Q.  Who is the person you admire most in your life?

My father because he has worked really hard for me and my brothers. He is the reason why I'm even here.

Q. What were the best things about growing up with three brothers?

I didn't have to worry about getting into trouble with other people because they always protected me. We also always played sports together. We would constantly be playing basketball, baseball and football, but not tackle because my mom wouldn't let me.

Q. What were the worst things about growing up with them?

Well we did fight a lot, and they always beat me up.  But I fought back and it was cool, because they treated me like I was one of them.

Q. What is the toughest thing you have ever gone through?

Coming [to FIU] and being changed to a lefty.  It was really tough because I was always used to succeeding, and I thought I was getting worse, but I was just slowly progressing.

Q. What is the greatest achievement in your life?

I would have to say winning two state championships in high school, being ranked #1 in the nation (in 2003) and getting a full scholarship to FIU.

Q. What do you think makes this year's team special?

We just have a bond on the field.  Last year we had great players, but you can't win with just great players. You have to click.  I feel like this team has all the right pieces to the puzzle.  Everybody understands their role and knows what they need to do for the team.

Q. What has Head coach Kim Gwyder taught you?

To be patient and always keep a level head. She helped me out a lot while I was trying to become a lefty.

Q. What is your greatest strength batting or fielding?

Fielding.

Q. What character trait did your parents instill in you?

Honesty and hard work. My father always told me that things always turn out for the best if you are honest, and if you work hard enough, you will always get what you want.

Headline: There's more to Danny Price than victory landmark
Subheadline: COMMENTARY
Author: Messod Bendayan / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Baseball Head coach Danny Price just earned the 1,000th win of his career, making him the 31st college baseball coach to accomplish such a feat. 

Not many in that elite fraternity have earned it faster than Price, who is currently in his 26th year with the program. Every win has come from FIU, with 133 of them coming before FIU advanced to Division I in 1983.

I could go on giving you facts, stats and numbers on Price. But numbers alone paint only part of the picture. So, let me tell you about the man himself.

Earlier this season, senior center fielder Dennis Diaz broke FIU's career stolen base record vs. LaSalle on Feb. 19. 

While Price said he was happy about the record, something else he said stuck in my head: "Records are fun only when you win."

No words I write can sum up Danny Price better as a coach. Being a champion is his dream, and every FIU baseball player sees it in writing every time they enter the locker room: "If you don't believe, you don't belong ... OMAHA."

In his world, individual records don't mean much when you're trying to be the best team in the country. As great as a 1,000 wins sound, it's not something Price likes to think about much and not just because it's a distraction from the ultimate goal. It's also a reminder of how long he's been at FIU, of old age creeping in, of time ticked away, his dream not yet in his grasp and wondering how much time he's got left to make them come true. 

In a sport where private colleges (like Miami) have a significant financial advantages over state schools (like FIU) in recruiting and Major League Baseball teams send scouts armed with radar guns and promises of fame and fortune to any good player willing to listen, the odds of a school like FIU fielding a team good enough to get to Omaha every year can feel like making lemonade with no lemons. 

But this is familiar to Danny Price - it's a part of the job, like the blue and gold he wears every game - and if you listen to him long enough, you might believe that despite the odds, he'll find a way to lift up that trophy in Omaha. Somehow.

Last season, FIU Baseball finished 29-33, only the second time ever that FIU Baseball finished under .500. In his space in the coaches' locker room, Price kept and read books like "The Power of Positive Thinking" to keep his spirits up,  hoping to pass on the good vibes to his struggling ball club.

Early on in that season, Price spoke during an on-air interview about his thoughts on nearing the 1,000-win mark, and he seemed flustered by the question. Eventually, he said, "Get back to me with that question once it gets here and I'll answer you then."

Later on that season, I broached the subject again, this time off-air. And again,  Price seemed flustered. But he did give me a partial answer.

"When you're in my position, you don't spend a whole lot of time on things like that. Winning games is hard enough without spending lots of time considering milestones and accomplishments and things like that. I don't have room in my head for anything but winning."

I have yet to ask Price his thoughts now that he's done it. But there is one thing I can tell you: No one is happier to get this milestone out of the way more than Danny Calvin Price, because the only history he really cares about is FIU calling its National Champion. 

It's a dream he's held ever since he was an outfielder on the 1973 Inaugural Baseball team, when FIU's athletes wore Sunblazers instead of Golden Panthers on their chests-a dream that's teased him and eluded him time and time again. 

It is a dream he is determined to catch. But I hope he'll take some time from that dream to reflect on what he has done and give himself a pat on the back. 

It's an amazing feat, and it adds more cement to his already legendary career.

Subheadline: With victory over quinnipiac, coach price reaches milestone
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With over a dozen of his family members in attendance, Head coach Danny Price put even more emphasis on his life-long commitment to the FIU baseball program by earning his 1,000th career victory with a 10-5 win over Quinnipiac University, March 10 at University Park Stadium.

Price is one of only 31 Division I college baseball coaches to reach the milestone and is one of 16 currently active coaches with 1,000 wins. 

Price has been the head coach for 26 years and was also on the first team FIU ever fielded. Fittingly, he also recorded the first hit in the program's history.

"In an era in athletics where longevity and loyalty become a lost art, [Price] is really a treasure to FIU," said Athletic Director Rick Mello. "He's given his life to this institution ... [and] from that standpoint, we owe him a huge debt of gratitude."

After earning his bachelor's degree in 1974, Price returned as a volunteer batting instructor for the Golden Panthers in 1978. 

During that season, FIU went on to break or tie 36 offensive records and amassed a team batting average of .318.

Price was appointed head coach only two years later, in 1980, and has compiled a career record of 1000-528 ever since.

"It's been a grind in some ways, and it's been a lot of fun in a lot of ways," said Price. "I feel very honored to be in the program as long as I've been here and to reach a plateau like this. I know it's special but at the same time I realize that it's the people who make these things possible: the players, the assistant coaches [and] the trainers. It's just been a great team effort."

Junior Frank Gonzalez (3-0) picked up the historic win in relief of starter Denny Hernandez. Gonzalez pitched five and two-third innings, allowed two runs on six hits, walked one batter and struck out a career-high eight.

Junior Nick Cadena who went 3-for-3 with a homerun, three RBIs, one run scored and a stolen base, led FIU offensively. Senior Dennis Diaz went 3-for-4 with three stolen bases, four runs scored and an RBI.

Quinnipiac got on the board first after a fielding error by second baseman Corey Lozano, and then four consecutive walks by Denny Hernandez led to two runs. Hernandez went for one-third of an inning in his first start of the season.

In the bottom half of the inning, FIU cut the deficit to one run after Diaz scored off a ground ball by junior Michael Lopez.

FIU then took the lead in the third inning after an RBI single by Diaz and a throwing error from the catcher (who attempted to catch Diaz stealing second) that scored shortstop Luis Rivera.

FIU added two more runs in that inning, as well as two more in the fourth, to take a 7-2 lead.

Quinnipiac crawled within a two-run deficit, 7-5, after scoring one run in both the fifth and sixth inning, off Gonzalez and another in the seventh, off junior Matt Rainey.

However, Cadena put the game away in the bottom of the seventh inning with a two-run homerun over the wall in left-center.

Danny Hernandez pitched a scoreless ninth inning to end the game. He allowed no hits and struck out a batter in his tenth appearance of the season.

"I just want the next win," Price said. "[I am] trying to get the program going again after the stumble last year."

Subheadline: Men deserve the same kind of perks at the club
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
With the stress of midterms finally coming to an end, the average college student is probably now wondering how to spend the time her or she once spent studying. 

Clubbing is one option. But if you're a male in Miami, you'll have to get a part-time job just to pay for your clubbing expenses. 

I've been going to clubs since my senior year in high school, and I can honestly say I have not been to one at which I've had a good time, mainly, because I have a penis. 

Women get every possible perk imaginable at clubs: free entry, free drinks, no dress code, entry for all ages. They can even select the music that is played at some clubs. 

What do men get? Men get to drive women to the club, wait in a longer line, pay triple the entrance fee, worry about the no sneaker and no hat rule and of course, the $45 dollar rum and cokes in miniscule plastic cups.

I know this sounds a bit exaggerated, but it's not fair. If a woman has a good body, big breasts and wild hair, she's in, no ID required. 

"The male to female ratio at clubs is insane," said junior Odalys Fernandez. "I don't want to go to clubs to dance with women. I go to  have a good time and meet some guys." 

I was once at a club, and there were literally 10 guys on the dance floor and four were bouncers. I went outside to see a line full of men who couldn't get in, because they were wearing sneakers. It's ridiculous."

A man wearing a clean pair of Converse sneakers that match a very expensive suit is not allowed to enter many clubs. 

On the other hand, a woman wearing a piece of Bounty paper towel on each nipple and an orange Celia Cruz wig would probably be escorted by the bouncer into the club and given an Appletini on the house to compensate for her five-minute wait.

The sad fact is that as long as they get in sooner or later, many men wait in the lines, pay the insane entry fee and liquor prices and take all sorts of bad treatment from bouncers that hit on their girlfriends in front of them.

A bouncer at Oxygen Sushi Bar and Night Club said men deserve the rough treatment.

"The reason why men don't get treated the same at night clubs is mainly because they are trouble makers. 

Men deserve to pay more because half of them end up getting piss drunk, fighting one another and leaving," said the bouncer, who preferred to remain nameless.

If men everywhere took a stand for what's right, club owners would realize they need our business to survive and should cut us a little slack in return. 

We deserve to have a good time too, do we not?

Headline: Online blogs replace old-fashioned diaries
Author: Maria Zanardi / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Online journals seem to be appearing everywhere. From Live Journal to Xanga, Internet journaling has become an unstoppable craze. 

The basic format of an online journal consists of the person's writing, a place where people can drop comments (and the journal-owner can respond) and links to the journals of friends and other random people the journal-owner wishes to call a friend (called a friends list). 

This is called networking, a great word which basically means allowing the friends of people you've never met to read up on your life and the lives of your friends. 

So just what exactly is the big appeal of letting dozens of acquaintances, and often strangers, into our personal lives? 

"I like it because you can say whatever you want, and no one can erase what you write," said freshman Elio Cardenas. I agree with him. Online journals are a great way to let loose your frustrations on the world. 

This can be done in many different ways. The most popular is currently to fill up excess journal space by writing out all the lyrics of a song when only one or two lines apply to your situation. Or, there's the ever-popular online journal tradition of making up your own cheesy poetry that people tend to skip over and not read anyway. 

Of course, there are other methods of "letting it all out" on online journals. These are sometimes called "rants". 

You can get in a fight with your friend and then go online and write all about how mad you are, because a certain person, whom you can't name (but she was certainly wearing a red shirt today) did such-and-such to you. 

Obviously, the friend will eventually find out it was her you were talking about and proceed to delete you from her friends list. Or worse, she'll rant about you. 

"Anyone could read your journal, so you have to be careful with what you write, which won't make this a journal of your real feelings, but one in which you write what you want others to know about," said sophomore Cristina Alvarez.

Online journaling has its pros as well as its cons. Most people don't write about their most personal experiences. 

However, if you manage to get through the muddle of boring entries about what people had for lunch, who they had lunch with and what song represents their current mood, you will manage to find a rare selection of entries which discuss current issues, tell funny stories, and might actually make you stop and think. 

"I like journals, they give you an insight into [the journal's owner]," said freshman Andrea Narino. 

Yes, online journals do give insight into their owners' lives. Not much, but just enough for you to know whether that person is worth talking to outside the Internet zone. This is probably why people are now turning to online journaling rather than private journaling. 

It's a way to let the world know what you're about with the security of being able to choose what you want the world to know. You can make yourself up to seem more social, more fun and smarter on an online journal than you are in real life. You can do this in a private journal too, with a major drawback - no one will ever read it.

In order for a journal to stay active, one must maintain it. The process of maintaining a journal includes logging in to your journal's website, finding out if anyone left any comments about your last entry and then proceeding to update your journal.  Next, you check to see what your friends have written, and, of course, you leave comments on their journals. 

Obviously, you then have to see who the person who left a comment on your friend's journal is, because he might be that guy from elementary school who kept sticking cheese sticks up his nose. 

By the time you are reading and remembering that they weren't cheese sticks, they were straws, an hour has passed and you still haven't studied for the math test tomorrow. 

However, math will have to wait, because straw boy has a link to girl-with-the-really-long-pigtail's journal, and her entries might actually be worth reading. 

In the end, online journals take up excessive amounts of time, and you can never really say exactly what's on your mind without people lashing out or ignoring you for a week. 

Most of the entries you'll read will be completely pointless. 

But, hey, at least you'll know what that guy in Michigan does on the weekends, and who can live without knowing that?

Subheadline: Women are the life of the party, should get perks
Author: Melissa Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ladies in free before 12! Free drinks all night long! 

What a wonderful world we live in, where women are finally rewarded for being simply fabulous. 

In the past, women have been treated as second class citizens, demoralized and practically made outcasts of society. 

I'm positive plenty of women would agree with me that the process of "whoring it up" for a night club is fantastic. The short skirts, push up bras, glitter and make-up- what more can a girl ask for? 

After the process of getting ready, we can strut our bad selves down to the infamous Miami night clubs in our 5-inch heels, of course. 

We deserve to be let in without having to wait in line, because we look absolutely amazing, damn it, and looking beautiful sure isn't easy. 

Do you gentleman want to know why drinks are not free for you? 

If boys were given free drinks, clubs would be left bankrupt, and you know it! 

I remember quite clearly, one night I was out with my friends having a great old time when this incredibly drunk guy came bumping and grinding our way with his over-the-top dance moves and over-the-top alcoholic breath. 

The kid actually thought he had us, with one drink in one hand and his "little friend" poking out of his pants. 

And he had paid for his own drinks. Can you imagine if drinks had been free? 

I mean come on! Not only would his "little friend" have been even more eager to come out and play, but the kid would have been drenched in beer, hollering for more. 

Everyone wants to go to a night club and have fun, especially women. 

We don't want to be harassed and embarrassed by drunken men. 

The night club experience should be fun for everyone. Sorry frat boys, certain regulations have to be in place. 

"I believe, if guys had the same privileges girls do at clubs, things would get out of hand fast, because admit it,  if guys were let in free, clubs would be overflowing with testosterone and stupidity- a bad combination," said junior Xyomara Cruz.

Men are nothing but trouble when they drink. I don't want to have to worry about a fight breaking out or shots being fired. 

Women are so much more calm and patient. Club owners don't have to worry about us causing any controversy. 

We sure can't fit a 14-magnum in our Gucci purses.

WEDNESDAY - FEBRUARY 23


On Feb. 23, officers Darwin Villavicencio and Richard Diaz reported to University Park's Panther Hall that heavy smoke was coming from the first floor trash chute area. The officers called the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue (MDFR) to investigate the smoke.  According to the MDFR, an unknown person(s) threw something in the trash chute on the fourth floor, which came in contact with the trash dumpster located on the first floor of the building. The sprinkler system was then activated and Panther Hall maintenance personnel reset the alarm and sprinkler system.


On Feb. 23, a student reported that his unattended, silver Toshiba laptop sitting on a desk on the third floor of the Green Library was stolen. The laptop is valued at $2,000. There are no known suspects.


On Feb. 23 officer Richard Diaz met FIU football coach Hurley Brown in a dorm room at the University Park Towers. Diaz responded to a call that narcotics might be present in one of the rooms. After searching the room, a white powder in a clear plastic bag, an electronic scale, a metal spoon and a razor blade were found on a desktop. Test results revealed that the white substance was cocaine. As both men left the apartment, they encountered two students, former FIU student, Drevian Jones and current FIU student, Diamond Hemingway. Brown asked them whom the cocaine belonged to and Jones confessed ownership. Later, Brown called the FIU police department to inform them of a conversation with Jones' mother, who informed Brown that Jones would turn himself in to FIU police. On Feb. 24, Jones surrendered himself to the FIU police. Afterwards, he was taken into custody and transported to the Miami-Dade County Jail.


WEDNESDAY - MARCH 2


On March 2, a student from the University Park campus reported that her wallet was stolen on Feb. 2, somewhere on the second floor of the Green Library.  Her wallet contained her Floridian and Columbian driver's licenses, Miami-Dade College and Florida Atlantic University ID's, credit cards, and $20.  No suspects have been found.

Author: Melissa Quincosa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In response to recent discussions about the Middle East, the Jewish Student Union and the Hillel Second Generation will sponsor Café Hillel on March 15.

Café Hillel is a resource for every Jewish Student Organization at different universities, according to Reyna Susi, Israel program associate for Hillel Second Generation. 

"So far it has been a positive asset to our community, providing awareness in career development, Jewish learning, social responsibilities, cultural activities and Israel advocacy," said Susi. "Café Hillel is designed to inform our community about the culture, technology and various resources in Israel."  

Café Hillel will also serve as an open forum in which students can voice their opinions and concerns regarding the Middle East and the war in Iraq.  

In addition there will be an photo exposition of Israel's well-known landmarks as well as a free cup of coffee for every student who attends.  

Information about a free 10-day trip to Israel, called "Birthright," will be available for students who are Jewish and have never been to Israel.  

Since this is the first time FIU hosts this event, Susi hopes that students can promote and encourage conversation and communication among Jewish and Non-Jewish students by creating an environment in which they can focus on Israel. 

Not only will Café Hillel give students the opportunity to discuss global issues, but some say they want to hear others' opinions on the war in Iraq as well as express their own.  

"I can't wait to hear other people's opinions and cultural experiences," said junior Jesse Carmona. 

"I really don't know what is going on in the war, but I'm concerned because I have family overseas," said freshman Tracee Smith.  

Café Hillel will meet  in the Graham Center Atrium and at the Biscayne Bay Campus on March 16 in front of the Oasis. 

This event will run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 	For more information, call (305) 692-8775.

Headline: Changes at this year's Career Week: students came prepared
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Forty-nine companies, many of them well-known, set up tables in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom on March 9, assembled for Biscayne Bay Campus's third annual Career and Intern Fair. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., dozens of professional-looking students scattered about the ballroom, carrying bags filled with flyers, cards, key chains and pens that companies provided at stands.

 Still, Rayaad Dinally, who is majoring in broadcast journalism, didn't hide his optimism. 

 "I found that, at the career fair, there's been a lot of interesting places," he said. "I mean, some wonderful, wonderful places to get experience [at]. All in all, I've had a wonderful time."

 Michael Bandy, an international student, had a different story. 

 "Most of the representatives for companies ... were very clear on the immigration status - either resident or citizen," Bandy claimed. "Because I only have a student visa, they wouldn't even look at my resume. They just gave me a little frown and told me, 'Well, good luck to you.'"   

One of the lesser known organizations at the career fair was Kids in Distress. It also one of the few that Bandy said  accepted his resume. The non-profit organization offers therapy and a residential program for free to children up to 12 years old who are referred through the court or school system. 

The organization was offering both paid and volunteer positions, as well as non-paid internships in areas such as education, nursing, social work and marketing. But according to Jan Albert, the director for Human Resources, students walked right by their table toward the big company names like Disney World. 

 Albert said that, in over two hours, Kids in Distress had only received two resumes. On the tables of other companies, resumes laid in piles.  

 The companies at the career fair ranged from the Walt Disney World Corporation and Washington Mutual  to non-profit to government organizations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the event. 

 But the FBI wouldn't take resumes. Instead, Administrative Specialist and FIU alumna, Luisa Enriquez represented the agency by providing information to students on how to eventually become one of the 900 special agents it hires, on average, per year. 

 "First you have what's called 'phase one testing,' which is all multiple-choice tests," Enriquez explained. "The next step is a formal interview by three veteran agents, and we tend to see individuals who have had a good solid work experience do better in interviews than individuals who have not had a previous work experience." 

 Enriquez said that, in eight years at the FBI, she didn't know of one person who hadn't had a job first before becoming a special agent. She gave one exception, however; because of "critical needs." The FBI will accept individuals with a degree in computer science, but no experience in the field. 

 According to Enriquez, because of the current state of events, the FBI gives preference to individuals who can speak Middle Eastern languages (such as Arabic and Hebrew), as well as Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Russian.   

 At the other end of the spectrum, Fox's Channel 7 had a different premise. To Diane Jaramillo-Guard, the business manager representing the channel at the career fair, eagerness more important than experience. She said that someone who has experience in journalism but who regards Channel 7 as just another job, has less of a chance of being hired than someone without any experience who appears committed, interested, eager to learn and not afraid of hard work. She also said that within three hours, 24 students had given her resumes and that half of them had "very good potential" to fill the 10 to 15 internship spots available per term at Channel 7. 

 Marilyn Lorenzo, a representative for the Sun-Sentinel, said students were mainly "interested in internships, not so much in full-time positions." At the career fair, the newspaper was offering internships as well as paid positions in advertising, human resources, operations, marketing, circulation and finance.

Claudia Reich had put several years of service into Career Services at FIU, but her first major project as the department's director was the career fair. She said students' preparation for the event had improved since last year, because they now had the chance to find out what employers expected and how they could measure up to these expectations. To help students make the most of the career fair, Career Services promoted workshops during the preceding Mega Career Week. At one of the workshops, "Bring Your Resume to School Day," on March 2, Hertz and Miami Dade Aviation critiqued students' resumes.  

Last year, employers complained that students were under dressed and under prepared. This year, students were required to dress professionally in order to attend the career fair. 

"We were very pleased with the quality and quantity of students and companies," Reich said, adding that employers expressed their approval, as well, especially over a change she implemented this year: actually requiring students to dress professionally in order to attend the fair.

Headline: Author Maya Angelou inspires students at lecture
Author: Damian Grass / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
From the audience's reaction, Dr. Maya Angelou's jazz-tinged voice painted a rainbow in the clouds over FIU during her speech on March 10.

In "An Evening with Maya Angelou," sponsored by the Student Government Association, the award-winning poet and playwright spoke to students, faculty and area residents at the Pharmed Arena about the ability to accept diversity, the magnitude of someone's influence and her tough childhood in rural Arkansas.

In front of a hushed crowd, Angelou, who was raped at the age of seven, began her 45-minute speech with a song. "When it looked like the sun wasn't shine'n anymore," she sang, "a rainbow appeared in the clouds." 

Angelou encouraged the audience to find that rainbow in their own cloud. That rainbow might be someone in "your family, in stories you've heard or books you've read [or] fictional people...," she said. 

Sophomore Sparkle Cooper took Angelou's advice to heart.

"It doesn't have to be a family member who inspires you," said Cooper after Angelou's lecture. "It can be a person who doesn't even know you, like Maya Angelou."

Throughout the evening, Angelou joked with the audience. She light-heartedly noted that since she has become a celebrity, she refuses to travel on airlines, claiming that it has become "a bit awkward."

"People in airports ask me to sign this and that, grab me, pull my clothes and even give me their babies," the world renowned poet who now travels by private bus, said, laughing. "Sometimes I would ask them to change [their diapers] first."

On her second visit to FIU since 1998, Angelou added that coming to Miami from her home in Winston, Salem, N.C., is no small matter.

"So when I say I'm glad to be here, I mean it." 

Graceful in stature at six feet tall, Angelou captivated the audience with dramatic pauses when she talked about her life and work. Like a great storyteller,  she recounted each story with great enthusiasm using her hands and face.

 Her rainbow-themed speech included some of her poems and stories as well as those of other established poets. She also quoted the Bible, Langston Hughes, William Shakespeare, her grandmother and other sources she claimed to be rainbows in her life.

"Maya Angelou is someone I really look up to," said Larissa Lockett, whose saxophone performance before Angelou's speech left the audience in awe. "I was glad that she was able to hear my talent."

Before Angelou went on stage, Sheldon Bailey, president for the Black Student Union, recited his thought-provoking poem called, "Dreams of Broken Child." 

But it was the FIU Gospel Choir that had the jam-packed arena singing along to an upbeat Swahili song. Shandra Webster, sister of an FIU student, walked away from the event enthused.

"What a fantastic evening," she said. "This has been one of the most inspirational events I have ever been to."

For Vicky Owles, assistant director for Campus Life and SGA advisor, the event was special because of the students who helped her put it together.

"This event was for the students who actually saw something completed from start to finish, and with such an amazing woman who they got to bring and share with the university community," said Owles. "So for me, it's all about the student's experience."

Maya Angelou, the little girl from a small town in Arkansas who grew up to become America's favorite rainbow in the clouds, continues to inspire the heroes and "sheroes" in everyone.

"Go out and learn about your differences, so that you're not left in this mean and narrow tunnel," she encouraged. "You'll see we have much more in common than what separates us."

Headline: Seafood bar and restaurant provides fresh quality foods
Author: Erik Tirums / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A cold, rainy afternoon in Miami provided the perfect opportunity to step inside, leave the beach and enjoy dining on Miracle Mile at Tarpon Bend.

Tarpon Bend is a seafood bar and restaurant that has only existed on Miracle Mile for 10 weeks, but has been a staple of South Florida restaurants since 1997. 

Started on a whim by four men on a fishing trip in the Keys, it grew from doodling on bar napkins from locations in Weston, Ft. Lauderdale and now, Miracle Mile. 

The ambiance of all three is a laidback atmosphere that was inspired by fishing, casual dining and the rush the owners received when fishing for the giant 100 lb. tarpon in the waters off of South Florida.

I walked into Tarpon Bend for a late afternoon, midweek lunch with a fellow diner. 

We were greeted by a welcoming and modern hostess that stood right at the entrance. The atmosphere also included trendy, light colors. 

The bar also reflected this new contemporary style that consisted of plasma TVs and waiters cloaked in black attire that contrasted the lightly colored decor. 

The seating options were at the raw bar or at a booth. We dined at a booth to receive the full experience of service.  

After being seated promptly by our hostess, my fellow diner and I scanned the menu and saw a large variety of classic Florida dishes such as grouper and conch fritters, as well as sandwiches and burgers. 

The catch of the day was mahi mahi, halibut or salmon, that could be prepared grilled, pan seared or blackened with your choice of a side - either oysters on the half shell or Florida stone crabs. 

We ordered the "All Crab, Crab Cake" as an appetizer, and the "Catch of the Day Halibut" with a side of green beans, the daily vegetable, along with the "Honey Mustard Glazed Salmon" that was served with a vegetable orzo (a larger grain pasta similar to rice). 

The appetizers ranged from $6.95 to $9.95, with salads and sandwiches upwards of $13.95 and entrees starting around $15.95 but becoming more expensive with the $21.95 grouper.

There was a list of beers both domestic and imported, signature cocktails and a very short, but sufficient wine list. 

I selected a white wine blend of Sauvignon Blanc and a Chardonnay from California called Conundrum to accompany my crab cake. 

To accompany the salmon, I chose a full-bodied red wine from Argentina, called Malbec. A Black and Tan beer was also ordered to pair with the Catch of the Day.

The crab cake was brought to the table with a keylime mustard sauce. The  small salad of greens was topped off with a balsamic vinaigrette. 

True to the menu's description, the crab cake had no filler and was all blue crab, seasoned and lightly breaded. 

The keylime mustard sauce was heavy but flavorful and the mayonnaise - based aioli that topped the crab cake was also a little heavy, but the salad helped break-up the heaviness of the sauces.

After the crab cake was cleared, the entrées arrived at the table. The halibut lacked almost any artistic presentation. 

The piece of fish was just placed on the plate next to the green beans, or French classically, Haricot Verts. 

It was expertly cooked with a criss-cross of grill marks, lightly seasoned. It was clearly a fresh, light tasting fish - very delicious. 

The bright green beans were also cooked perfectly and had the right consistency; they were crispy. 

The highlight of the meal was easily the honey mustard glazed salmon on a bed of orzo (a larger grained pasta similar to rice) with roasted vegetables. 

Tarpon Bend focuses on seafood and definitely knows how to prepare its dishes. 

The salmon was perfectly cooked medium with a light whole grain mustard and honey glaze, colorfully laid upon the orzo with roasted zucchini and yellow squash. Service at Tarpon Bend was more than sufficient considering the time that we arrived. 

On a slow mid-week afternoon, during the transition between lunch and dinner and a shift change for the wait staff, many restaurants' service suffers. 

The two responsible servers, along with the bar staff and hosts were all extremely helpful and attentive. 

It was obvious that the menu and wine list had not been learned to a tee, but that is expected for a restaurant that has only been opened for 10 weeks.

Tarpon Bend seems to be following the same recipe for success as its sister restaurants. It has a popular happy hour, laid back atmosphere and correctly prepared fresh seafood. 

The easy parking, sufficient service and trendy ambiance also adds positively to the dining experience. 

The lack of menu creativity, the steep prices and the plate presentation subtracted from the experience.

Headline: Forging the surburban wilderness
Author: Raquel Cool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For those who don't have many plans for the upcoming spring break, here is a fun time consumer that can be used to replace all the fun in the sun: suburban camping.

The art of suburban camping is arguably the boca burger to the meaty burger of a real camping excursion.  Still, don't underestimate the flavor of this "meatless" take on tradition.  

A step between grocery shopping and hiking the Amazon, suburban camping has the fun of real camping minus the expense of a road trip.

While the well-groomed wilderness won't guarantee lions and tigers and bears, it is likely to provide mosquito bites and chirping crickets so believable, you won't tell the difference.

So, grab a few friends, a cooler full of sandwiches and set up camp no farther than your own backyard. Follow this checklist to guide a worthy camping experience.

Gather your friends

Whether you only bring one person or three, work together to make this trip a smooth one. I personally favor a potluck approach to planning. For example, you bring the fishing rod and I'll bring the bait.

Pick a spot 

If you're feeling adventurous, find someplace less familiar than your backyard. Even if you don't live in rows of gated townhouses, find someone who does. 

Ask around! Befriend a suburbanite! There are plenty of places in neighborhoods that are grassy, tree-filled, and most importantly, out of the way.  

The key is to find a good spot where you won't bother anyone and no one will bother you.

Things to forget

When suburban camping, bird watching is - well, for the birds. Unless you want to eye the local ducks or watch them eye you for food, leave the binoculars at home. 

Intermediate suburban campers should consider leaving their cell phones behind too. 

You may not be away from it all, but isn't it worth trying?

Activity bag

When you're not climbing trees or rolling in the grass, consult your prepared bag of camping activities. It can include, but is definitely not limited to, a deck of cards, a box of sparklers, a Polaroid camera and stacks of comics - pretty much anything you feel like talking.

Hunt for food

Suburban hunting is fancy talk for raiding your refrigerator. Stock a cooler full of water bottles, chips and sandwiches. This 10 to 20-hour excursion will likely not require much food, but use your imagination to figure out what you'll need.

S'mores

What camping trip would be complete without toasty marshmallows with gooey innards wedged between melted chocolate and two graham crackers?  

No, it wouldn't be pseudo-camping without the suburban recipe for s'mores. 

Because you can't roast your marshmallows in a self-made bonfire or even an itty bitty ground fire, canned fire will do the trick. 

If your first impression of canned fire was to hold up a lighter to a steady stream of canned aerosol, that would be a little too do-it-yourself and a lot too hazardous for camping in the suburbs.  

Instead, invest in a pack of Sterno - canned cooking fuel. These little cans of flammable gel are easy to extinguish as well as ideal for a watered-down and fired-up camping experience.  

Ghost stories

While roasting s'mores, take turns huddling around a flashlight with widened eyes, whispering tales about haunted suburbanites who lurk throughout the neighborhood at night.

Common Sense

Don't leave your common sense at home. Even a suburban camping experience must be a safe one: do not take part in any activities without being fully aware and responsible for any of their possible consequences.

Sleeping bags

The sleeping bag is a crucial item for a camping adventure. With a pillow and a sleeping bag, you'll be set to cocoon yourself into soft flannelly goodness, like a nylon slug prepared to sleep.

Rent-a-tent

Are you unequipped without a tent? Take advantage of your local rent-a-tent locations.

They are unwittingly sponsored by corporate retail chains that rhyme with words like Tal-Mart and Warget. 

Just tell them "90-day return policy" sent you. I think they'll catch your subtle drift.

As a new suburban camper, you are a drifter indeed. Who else but you will indulge in unapologetically excessive behaviors such as setting up camp in the middle of a golf course? There are certain obligations you must fulfill as a hip, thrifty and ambiguously exploitative individual. 

But hey, where you say trespassing freeloader, I say poh-tah-to.

Headline: Previous grammar test requirements change for journalism students
Author: David Smiley / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Changes are on the way for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Students received an e-mail in their FIU accounts Wednesday, March 3 from Patricia B. Rose, professor and associate dean of SJMC, detailing four different changes related to it's language skills test.

According to the e-mail, starting Summer semester, SJMC will no longer use the current Word Association grammar skills test. The grammar test, which all SJMC must pass in order to graduate, will now be modeled after the one in use at the University of North Carolina.

Rose said the new test is very different. It will consist of sentences with grammatical errors which students must correct. 

"This is far more of a usage test, or a copy-editing test, than a strict grammar test," Rose said. "It's far more practical in nature."

According to Rose, the Word Association declined to renew their contract with FIU, which expires in June. They gave no explanation as to why they chose not to renew the contract.  

This left the university shopping for another provider for a language skills test.

Rose contacted over a dozen universities throughout the United States  regarding their grammar exams. After having several schools sent her their tests, Rose selected the two she believed to be best.  

The final choice was approved by Allan Richards, interim chair of journalism and broadcasting, Catherine Ahles, interim chair of advertising and public relations and a faculty committee. One member of the faculty committee took the exam in order to confirm its efficiency.

The current Word Association grammar exam has not been particularly popular among FIU students lately.  Last semester students reported problems with practice quizzes on the Word Association website.  

The SJMC even received a petition against the exam signed by over 100 students. Students eventually made enough commotion to cause the SJMC to temporarily waive its required entrance scores for Spring registration into the Writing Strategies class. The school stipulated that students must earn the grammar test scores  they need for the classes in which they are enrolled by Feb. 15.

Nevertheless, many students are anxious about the new the test, based on their experiences with the current one.  

"It was too much pressure," said Anna Auiora, a junior in the advertising program, of her experience with SJMC's current grammar test. "Even if you were a good student and you got good grades you would fall back [if you didn't pass the test]."

Richards, who has taught the school's Writing Strategies course for eight years, stresses the importance of not stressing. "The test should not become bigger than the course," said Richards.  "Don't make it larger than life."

Richards believes students psychologically and emotionally psyche themselves out.

While downplaying the role of the grammar exam, Richards emphasized the importance of SJMC students honing their English skills.  

"The test is an indication. If you're going to become a dentist you should know something about teeth. You can't be in these careers without strong language skills,"  Richards said.

As stated in Rose's e-mail, pre-requisite scores for MMC 3104, Writing Strategies, will remain at 65 and exit scores will remain at 75. The exam will also still have a $15 fee. However, now students will take the exam in the classroom, rather than at a computer lab.

Also, beginning with the Summer semester, an exit score of 75 will now satisfy pre-requisite scores for upper division courses in the SJMC. These course currently require higher entrance scores.  This effects JOU3117, JOU3300, JOU4341c, and RTV4324 for students majoring in journalism and MMC 4410 for students majoring in advertising and public relations.

SJMC students seemed to agree that a grammar exam is a useful tool, but some felt the required scores were too high.  For instance, JOU3300 currently requires a score of 85 to enter the class.  According to the Word Association website, a score of 85 is in the 94th percentile out of approximately twenty thousand tests.

Student views about the required grammar test scores for certain classes vary depending on who is asked.  Students who have yet to enter the Writing Strategies course seem to embrace the change.  

"I think it's good because you can take courses you need and not be set back by the test," said Sean Jones, a junior in the advertising program.

However, other students who have taken the exam, like junior Brenna Mello, are more critical of the change. 

"The fact that our standards were so high made us stand out. Now we're going to be just like every other school."

Students like Chuck Ross, who is majoring in journalism, expressed strong feelings about the importance of the grammar exam.  

"The grammar test made the program stronger," said Ross.  "We had a lot of dead wood.  A lot of people couldn't just get into a class, then they couldn't get out of it, and it just made them better for it."

According to Richards, the upper level pre-requisite scores were lowered because some of the faculty felt students should receive more teaching and less testing.  

"The goal is to replace constant testing with more teaching," said Richards.

Richards also noted that the changes are being made to create continuity within the program. Instruction in grammar and AP style will now be incorporated in the classroom.  

SJMC's new goal is to give students continuous instruction in grammar in their journalism classes, instead of just cramming for a grammar test.

Much like the students, SJMC faculty did not unanimously agree on whether to lower standards for entry into the upper division courses.  

Kevin Hall, Editor-in-Residence and head of the Journalism Writing Project, was unavailable for comment but expressed his displeasure at the coming changes.

Recently I have been wowed by a local band. Last week I met an old friend for a few beers at the Churchill's Pub (NW)... We hung around untill late when the last band started playing!
WOW!!! I could not believe it.... I was just not expecting this king of sound and performance from a local in an empty pub on Sunday night! Everyone was shocked... Even the bartender was shocked. The sound guy (who was terrible) had his jaw open like he could not understand it either.

This may sound exagerated, but they were good! I have always been so sad for local bands, but this is a savior. I hope you can give these guys a little of your time...
