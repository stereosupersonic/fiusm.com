Headline: Black managers in jeopardy
Author: JIM LITKE / AP Wire
&nbsp;
Dusty Baker is gone. Frank Robinson is finished.

Cito Gaston won two World Series for the Toronto Blue Jays but hasn't seen the inside of a dugout in years. And Don Baylor suffered the same fate a few years ago that befalls losing managers everywhere _ he was fired.

So now there is one. One black manager in baseball. One.

The same number there was in 1975, the year Robinson made history by becoming the first of his kind in the major leagues. 

One.

Not a token one, to be sure. Willie Randolph has some serious credentials, and he just might have his New York Mets on the way to the World Series.

But, in a sport that has liked to pat itself on the back in recent years for opening the way to minority hires, one seems like an awfully lonely number.

It's good old boy system kept minority candidates out of the dugout and front offices for so long the sport is morally obligated to make sure the managerial pool is racially balanced.

It's hard to fathom today, but it took 28 years from the time Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier before there was a black manager in the major leagues. 

Since then, baseball's diversity record has been an uneven one, though Bud Selig deserves credit for trying to increase the numbers of minority managers and general managers by forcing teams to submit lists of them. It's worked up to a point, peaking at 10 black and Latino managers in the 2002 season, but the pendulum seems to be swinging the other way with a grand total of three now.

Baseball, though, has a bigger problem: the sport is no longer a black man's game.

That doesn't mean baseball isn't diverse, but the number of blacks players in the major leagues has fallen to 8 percent, the lowest since the Boston Red Sox became the last team to integrate in 1959. Last year, the Houston Astros were the first team in 52 years to go to a World Series without one black player on the roster.

And the number of black players in colleges, Little League or on the sandlots is shrinking every year.

Not many teams will want you to manage if you've never played the game.

Things have changed a lot in a short time. In 1971 the Pittsburgh Pirates were on their way to the World Series when they fielded a starting lineup that included all black and Latino players for the first time. And black players took up one in four roster spots in the big leagues in the 1970s and '80s.

Somewhere along the way, though, baseball lost its appeal to black youth.

The sport became irrelevant, and baseball owners were too busy building new stadiums with luxury boxes to seem to care.

Sociologists can debate the reasons, though a few are readily apparent. It's a lot easier to find a hoop than a sandlot in an inner city, and the superstars of the NBA and NFL are the new role models for youths aspiring to get college scholarships or play pro ball.

There was a time when kids asked their parents for a baseball glove. Now they want the latest sneakers.

It might be different if the parents were baseball fans, but there's not many of those, either. Do your own test during the playoffs _ count the number of black fans you see when a foul ball is hit into the stands.

It's startling few, even in Washington, D.C., where 57.7 percent of the population is black.

Some well-meaning people are trying to change that, but they started late and face an uphill struggle. Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter and some other black players have launched an urban Little League program to try to get black youths involved in baseball. And baseball itself opened its first Urban Youth Academy this year offering free instruction in the inner city of Compton, Calif.

Some day the same kids helped by those programs might be playing in the major leagues. Some day they might even become major league managers.

For the near future, though, the trend is not good. There are plenty of black candidates for the four open jobs now, but the talent pool soon will begin to dwindle. Teams that already have enough excuses not to hire minorities now will have one more.

Baseball needs black managers, and it needs more black executives like Ken Williams, who put together the White Sox team that won the World Series last year.

A bigger worry, though, is figuring out what happened to black players and black fans.

Because baseball needs them even more.

Headline: Men's soccer loss to SMU doesn't paint whole picture
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The score lied to everyone who didn't witness SMU battle FIU at University Park. 

The Mustangs may have earned a 3-2 overtime victory, but only the 850 people in attendance at Soccer Stadium truly know the story of that match. 

The men's soccer team gave a performance so strong-willed and exceptional that its 4-4-2 record deserves an asterisk. How else could anyone truly understand the fight they put up against SMU, a team ranked No. 1 in all four collegiate soccer polls?

Questionable decisions by the match referee took away FIU's team captain, starting midfielder and head coach - all within four minutes of each other. Despite this disadvantage, the Golden Panthers kept pace and nearly defeated a team favored to win a national championship.

An asterisk is clearly in order.

But that's not allowed in the results-driven world of soccer. You either win, lose or draw. Neither FIFA nor the NCAA has made a category that accurately describes what happened Sept. 29.

On a night that FIU honored the 1996 men's soccer team that reached the NCAA championship game, the Golden Panthers played valiantly. They reassured players like former defender Kevin Birusingh that coach Karl Kremser still fields a team based on hustle, heart and a willingness to challenge anyone. 

The current squad doesn't have the same level of talent, and hasn't proven to be as disciplined as the one they honored Sept. 29. But traces of the resilience that the '96 team carried into the College Cup still linger at University Park. A bit of that '96 magic filled the air as members of a historic squad watched the next generation of Golden Panthers admirably carried the torch. 

The torch couldn't have been lit at a better time. Since the beginning of the season, FIU has struggled when facing the top-tier of collegiate soccer. Though talented, players have occasionally lacked discipline, intensity or a consistent will to win. 

When FIU lost a close match to then No. 18 Illinois-Chicago a few weeks ago, players just couldn't combine the intangible pieces needed to defeat a ranked opponent.

Well, someone must have given FIU a whole new set of blueprints because the Golden Panther constructed the performance that head coach Karl Kremser has pushed for all year. For 102 minutes, the men's soccer team had a near-perfect game against the best team in the country. It's a shame that what they built was knocked down by a few errant whistles. 

SMU brought its undefeated record and No.1 ranking back to Dallas, but the Mustangs left behind a dangerous foe. 

FIU is battle-tested and understandably disappointed by the hard-fought match between the two teams. That emotion is bound to carry over now that Conference-USA league play has begun, and the Golden Panthers will need it to make it through a tough conference schedule. 

Until the NCAA is willing to add an asterisk column, now is the time for FIU to funnel their disappointment into more wins.

Headline: New assistant draws inspiration from past experiences
Author: Renaldo Smith / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The opening chapter to Desma Thomas' basketball story went nothing like she planned. 

In her final year of high school at American Senior High, Thomas didn't have luck on her side when she tore her ACL early in the basketball season.

However, even the constant pain of a torn ligament wasn't enough to keep her away from the game as she continued to play the entire season in hopes of helping her teammates make it to the championship.

More than a decade later, Thomas, who was recently named an assistant coach on the Florida International University's women's basketball team, will look to instill that same heart and passion in the budding team.

After high school, Thomas decided to stay at home and attend nearby University of Miami where she obtained a bachelor of business administration in sports management, and at the same time managed to have a brilliant basketball career with the Hurricanes as well. To this day, Thomas remains the schools all time leader in both three point field goals made and attempted, and was a two time all Big-East Third Team member. 

After graduating in 1997, Thomas earned a spot on the Phoenix Mercury in the inaugural season of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She then played overseas in Italy, Turkey and Sweden before joining the Birmingham Power in the National Women's Basketball League (NWBL) in 2001.

Unfortunately, Thomas would fall victim to another ACL injury in early 2001, and this time she was unable to play through it like she did in high school.

"After I tore my ACL in Birmingham I just thought that was it and I knew I wanted to coach. I started my first coaching experience was in New Orleans at Dillard University which was a great experience for me and after two seasons I got an opportunity at a division one school at the University of Rhode Island," she said.

After two successful years, everyone expected Thomas to stay put as part of a growing program in Rhode Island.  However, although she found success at a division one school, Thomas says she could not pass up the opportunity to come back home to Miami and says she is confident in F.I.U's chances to compete.

"I would definitely say that coming back to Miami was a big reason for me coming here to F.I.U. Getting the opportunity to come back home and just knowing in the past how successful F.I.U programs use to really be and how good it has became were all factors," she said. 

Although she was a good all around player in her days on the court, Thomas was known specifically for her deadly shooting touch from the outside and says she looks forward to helping each member of the team improve on their shooting percentage this coming season.

As far as expectations go, Thomas admits she still has somewhat of a blind eye as to what the team will look like this year, but is confident based on what she has seen in the past.

 "I haven't really seen the total team yet but F.I.U has always been strong because of there inside play and the ability of their inside players to face up and shoot jumpers. With the mixture of the quickness of the guards and the bangers inside I think we should be able to develop and vie for the Sun Belt championship and hopefully get into the NCAA tourney," she added.

According to Thomas, she is looking forward to learning all that she can from Head Coach Cindy Russo and working along side new, assistant coach Joanne Aluka-White.

At 32 Thomas is back home and excited about taking F.I.U's women's squad to higher heights.

&nbsp;
In his final season as a Golden Panther, senior David Hope is looking to help bring a Conference USA championship to FIU. 

He currently leads the team with 4 goals on the year, including a 2-goal performance in a shutout against Florida Atlantic, making that his third career game with multi-goals.

The 6'2" forward from New Castle Upon Tyne, England has also played on state championship teams, earning himself titles such as Player of the Season, Manager's Player of the Year and Top Goal Scorer for Whitley Bay.

Starting in 10 of 17 games last season as a junior, and 9 of 11 games this year, Hope's consistency has helped him become one of the key players for the men's soccer team,

Which intend on turning things around during the second half of the season.

Q: The first few games of this season didn't go as planned. How did the team keep a positive attitude towards the following games?

We knew we were going to be facing some top teams. It was hard at first, but it brought us closer.

Q: How has the team improved during the time you have been a part of it.

This year we have improved a lot, even though [our record] is not the best. 

There is more of a willingness to work and wanting to win. We have a greater unity.

Q: What are some of your thoughts as you first step onto the field before a game?

I'm excited to play. I'm also thinking about scoring goals.

Q: What is your own personal career highlight?

It would have to be the recent SMU (9/29) game. I was injured for most of the week, but I was able to come into the second half and score a goal for the team.

Q: What are your plans for soccer once the season is over?

I don't really have any. I play for fun and enjoy it. 

But I don't intend in trying to become a professional.

Q: With about half of the season left to play, what can we expect from the team?

Hopefully a lot more wins. I think that our performance against SMU proved we can play hard, even though we couldn't get the win. 

As we begin to get into conference play it is important to start winning.

Q: What are some differences between playing in England, and playing in here at FIU?

Over here there is less contact and cards are given out easier. Also, here at FIU the ball is passed around more. 

Q: If you were given the chance to be a professional athlete for a day. Who is it?

Wayne Rooney. He is just a legend.

Q: If you cold change one thing from the previous three season, what would it be?

I would have changed the end of last  season, we would have won the conference.

Q: What kind of impact would you like to have made on the team prior to leaving FIU?

I want to be remembered as a player who worked and played hard everyday.

Headline: DEAD LAST
Subheadline: After nearly upseting top ranked SMU, men's soccer falls to Tulsa
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Still stinging from a double-overtime heartbreaker to SMU, the men's soccer team dropped its second straight match at home, losing 2-0 to Tulsa. A pair of nearly-identical goals propelled the visiting Golden Hurricane to victory in the Oct. 4 match, and knocked FIU down to the bottom of the Conference-USA standings.

Tulsa (4-7-0, 2-1-0) attacked early and often, while FIU (4-5-2, 0-2-0) played sluggishly throughout the first half. The Golden Panthers struggled to protect their goal and had even more trouble penetrating their opponent's defense, which allowed only two first-half shots on goal. 

"We were losing passes all game and nobody was looking for anyone else," senior defender Chris Handy said. "[Losing to SMU] definitely affected the game, but if you want to play college soccer, you can't let that happen."

Tulsa took a 1-0 lead with a Jose Parada goal in the 35th minute. Midfielder Hunter Christiansen stole the ball from FIU defender Sina Ebrahimi on the left flank and then zipped the ball to Parada, who easily scored from close range.

Defender Kyle Corrie provided a bit of déjà vu when he scored on a point-blank shot in the 78th minute. After midfielder Eric Burkholder controlled a ball thrown-in near the right outside marker, Corrie made the score 2-0 by guiding Burkholder's low cross into the left side of the goal. 

"Obviously it was an emotional game against SMU, but we didn't come ready to play tonight," assistant head coach Munga Eketebi said. "We played poorly from the get-go and there's no excuse for that at this level."

Things could have been worse for FIU. Though both teams took 11 shots in the match, Tulsa forced senior goalkeeper Shawn Crowe to make 4 crucial saves in the first half. 

Forward Joe Salem nearly scored on a shot directly in front of goal in the 4th minute, but Crowe blocked the attempt with his right foot. Ten minutes later, Crowe saved Burkholder's low, slightly-left-leaning penalty kick by trapping the ball on the ground. 

But the two occasions that Tulsa did score and the several opportunities that FIU squandered left the Golden Panthers searching for answers. 

"We played so hard against the No. 1 team in the country and then played really bad against Tulsa," sophomore midfielder Dadi Kristj&aacute;nsson said. "[The difference in play] is hard to explain."

Eketebi added, "Tactically, we never got it together, which is a crying shame." 

FIU did threaten to score in the 51st minute when sophomore Levi Coleman split two defenders inside the penalty area. Coleman passed the ball to sophomore midfielder Oli Birgisson, but Birgisson's shot ricocheted off the left goalpost.

Minutes later, another promising chance ended in disappointment when Christian Caporaletti stumbled in the penalty area. The freshman forward intercepted a pass and then evaded Tulsa goalkeeper Tyrel Lacey in a one-on-one challenge, but lost his balance immediately after. 

Defenders quickly cleared the ball before Caporaletti could shoot. 

FIU played without head coach Karl Kremser and usual starters David Hope and Phill Fisher, who served one-match red card suspensions. 

Their absence hurt the Golden Panthers's effort, but more importantly, the loss to Tulsa now hurts FIU's chances at qualifying for the C-USA tournament.  

"We've dug ourselves in a hole, which you don't want to do because now we have to [win or tie] every time we play," said Eketebi. "Tulsa is a 3-7 team so losing tonight would have killed their season. 

"They had their backs against the wall and played accordingly. Now we're the ones with our backs against the wall."

Headline: Is abstinence dead?
Author: Crisnatha Derosier / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Sex. Everyone is doing it, right? While it is undeniable that sex plays a major role in our society, others still believe that being sexually active is something intended for two people that are united by marriage.

Sex before marriage is more common in our society today than it was in the 1950s. 

What happened? Is it because we no longer value the sacredness of sexual behavior? Is it because having sex has grown to be viewed as more casual than special?

The media plays a big role. Living in a country where sex sells and where the definition of being sexy has become about how much clothing a woman wears - or rather, how much she doesn't wear - I can understand the pressure that is put on young and single people to fit in.

Society has you believe that everyone else is having sex except for you. It paints a beautiful picture for you of how wonderful the experience can be, but there are some things that it fails to tell you - it fails to tell of all the dangers and responsibilities that can follow.

We are living in a time when our children are raised by television and urged to move along with the majority. Increasingly, ambitious young adults are delaying marriage. Census data shows that young adults in South Florida are waiting slightly longer than the national average, with more than half staying single through their 20s and a little less than one-third staying single between the ages of 30 and 34.

Being ambitious is wonderful, and if you choose to focus on your career before you walk down the aisle, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Is it wrong for these individuals to have sexual relations before marriage? Yes it is.

Love without commitment is not really love at all, but rather it is only lust. Marriage alone provides security from the fear of being seduced and used, and then abandoned.

Many young adults have the "sex or else" mentality. They think that the purpose of dating is sex and that by denying their mate the "right" to sex, they are nullifying the relationship. When someone gives into this feeling,  they usually end up getting dumped and badly hurt.

These individuals are completely comfortable with their sexuality and see absolutely nothing wrong with being physically intimate with someone with whom they have developed a connection. 

Does this make those individuals bad people? 

This is where values come into play. Your take on this issue can be the result of different things: the way you were raised or simply the way you view sex.

I personally believe that remaining a virgin until marriage is very important and has numerous rewards. You will share a connection that you have only experienced with your spouse, and there will be no room for comparison.

For those who are saving themselves for "the one" - keep the faith. It may get difficult, but standing by what you believe will be the best decision for you in the long run.

Headline: Sifting Through The Stupid...a column about campus affairs
Subheadline: Waiting for a Smile ~ FIU bureaucracy frustrates students
Author: Shawn M. Sprocket
&nbsp;
"You're number 58 in queue," says an electronic voice at the end of the phone. You curse to yourself. This is the tenth time you've called to resolve your financial aid issues and you still haven't gotten through to a human being.

"No big deal," you tell yourself, "I'll just go to the office in person." 

But when you arrive, the line stretches out the door and everyone looks irritated. After waiting in line for an hour you reach the front desk, where an overworked, underpaid and frustrated woman tells you that you need to go to the neighboring office. 

There, you wait again - this time only thirty minutes. The teller at the counter says that you're in the wrong line, and you start to see a pattern.

It is at this point that many students have their first great epiphany: taking care of business with FIU's many departments and offices is near impossible.

Now, it's time for your second epiphany: this annoying problem is more complex than it seems. 

One graduate student, Jonelle Graham, works on the 

newly-formed Enrollment 

Services Student Council. The group, which was founded just this year, focuses on making the student-administration relationship less stressful. Graham assures that both school administrators and students want to improve the efficiency of the school's bureaucracies, and that her group is a step in the right direction. She says the blame shouldn't fall on the school's departments or workers, but on the state's overcomplicated funding process.

Last year, FIU was ranked as the ninth largest school in the state of Florida, but was eleventh in public funding. Why does FIU get less money? Because the state's guidelines for awarding money to schools are based on a detailed, complicated system of requirements. Once any money is awarded, specific funds can only be spent on designated projects and positions.

But some issues cannot be resolved with money. The biggest complaint I've heard from students isn't that they have to wait in lines - you do that just about everywhere - but that they have to deal with disgruntled office clerks.

Undergraduate student Leza Goldberg recalls horror stories of paperwork being lost, clerks giving her attitude and departments making stupid mistakes. 

Personally, I feel like I get better customer service over the transaction of a Big Mac than I do over issues concerning my education.

Still, the problem facing students remains unsolved. While extravagant building projects continue to expand, FIU seems unable to cope with the ever-increasing student population; a rearranging of priorities is due.

This problem is only getting worse with time, and the real blame lies on all three levels: the state, the University and the employees who help students must change for the better. 

The employees need to remind themselves that students are paying customers and thus deserve their gracious, genuine concern. The University administration needs to remember that their priority is helping resolve students' problems, not on raising executives' salaries or giving us the runaround. Finally, the state needs to pay attention to the efficacy of how it allocates funds.

In high school, I held the prestigious title of "Smoothie Technician." Like most students who have worked low-end, work-for-peanuts positions, I was forced to smile and be helpful to customers. When a customer had a smoothie that tasted more like raspberry than like bananas, I had to put on a smile and take care of the problem. I think paying thousands of dollars to the University should earn us at least that kind of customer service.

Headline: Big plans lined up for Hispanic Heritage celebration
Author: Martha Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In celebration of this year's Hispanic Heritage month, FIU is hosting a series of events  -  Mi Orgullo 2006.

The 13-day celebration, which began Oct. 2 at the Biscayne Bay Campus, will consist of a variety of events that will provide students, faculty and staff an opportunity to learn about diversity in Latin cultures. 

"This year we hope to celebrate Hispanic culture by highlighting every country's pride," said Ayxa Barbel, cultural celebration chair for Students Programming Council. 

One of the goals of the celebration, according to Barbel, is to promote Hispanic culture.

"What makes the Hispanic Heritage Celebration unique is the fact that we are all very diverse, but we also have commonalities that unite us all as Latinos," Barbel said.

Junior Lashunda Love said she enjoys the celebrations because she can identify with it.

"I enjoy listening and dancing to Latin Music," Love said. "I find the rhythm [and] beats similar to the beats of the African-American music."

BBC is also hosting their set of events. 

 "Our main purpose is to be educational. We want students to learn about Latin history and their traditions," said Vanessa Robinson, BBC vice president of Students Programming Council.

Among other events is the Day of the Dead, an educational presentation about the meaning behind the Mexican holiday. 

"My goal is to show the humor behind death because the entire celebration is to mock death," said Gabriel Labrador, speaker of the house for the Student Government Council at BBC.

Other events include a story telling of Moctezuma's Revenge and a concert featuring Fulanito and Proyecto Uno which will be held at BBC.

All events, unless specified, are free for FIU students, faculty, staff and the public.

Headline: Organization seeks to increases HIV/AIDS awareness
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
Last year, Tamara Marryshow and Matthew Parisi felt that FIU students and staff needed  education and awareness on HIV and AIDS.

Thus, B-HIVE - which stands for Be HIV Educated - was born.

"We didn't see any awareness programs at FIU to educate the community about HIV and AIDS," said senior Marryshow. "B-HIVE's goal is to not only educate the FIU community, but also help those who are infected or affected by the disease in our local community."

According to careresource.org, Florida has the third highest number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.

Forty-five percent of all people living with AIDS in Florida are currently living in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These statistics are the reason why the B-HIVE Project was formed at FIU.

Sophomore Juanita Escobar, who is involved in B-HIVE, believes the project is a necessary philanthropy that is beneficial to FIU students and the community at large.

"This is a great project," Escobar said. "It is important to help others and the B-HIVE Project is a great way to do it."

B-HIVE first made its presence known by hosting a big event Dec. 1, 2005, as part of that year's World AIDS Day. The event was held out in the housing quad and drew in more than 200 students.

By the end of the fundraising event, B-HIVE had raised almost $3,000. This money had also been raised through fundraising efforts and donations collected throughout the year.

All of the money went to the Children's Home Society of Florida, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to provide social services that will benefit children and families.

Marryshow was pleased with the outcome of B-HIVE's event and fundraising efforts.

"It was an overwhelming success, and I was very proud to have gotten so much support from the FIU community," she said.

Riding on the success of last year's fundraiser, B-HIVE will be holding another big fundraising event Nov. 28.

The event will begin at 5 p.m. out on the housing quad with tables giving out information regarding HIV and AIDS. Free testing provided by Care Resource will also begin at this time and will last until the end of the event.

At 7 p.m., there will be presentations by the Wellness Center and the SENORITAS Project, which stands for Student Education Needed In Order To Reduce Infection and Transmission of AIDS/HIV and STDs. There will be testimonials given by people who have been affected by HIV and AIDS in any way.

In March, B-HIVE began fundraising to benefit the Center for Positive Connections, a nonprofit organization in Miami-Dade that deals with foster care and case management of children and families who have been either infected or affected by HIV and AIDS.

B-HIVE is also holding a banner contest. The only requirements of the contest are that the sign be the length of a banner; the banner cannot be professionally made; and the banner has to read "(Name of organization) Supports the B-HIVE Project."

The winner of the contest will receive five percent of all the proceeds raised to be used for the charity of their choice.

"It's a good way to have one charity help another," Marryshow said.

Marryshow expressed that the satisfaction of fundraising for a cause is more important than anything else.

"In the end, the honey of our efforts can be in making a difference in the lives of those we help," she said.

Escobar believes it is essential to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS in order to educate students at FIU about the diseases.

"I believe that HIV is something a lot of people are not aware of. I think it's very important for them to understand that it's something real and it could happen to them if they're not aware of it or not careful," Escobar said.

Chris Hord, an FIU alumnus who was involved in the B-HIVE project last year, is aware that many people do indeed have misconceptions and false knowledge concerning HIV and AIDS.

"People think a smaller group gets affected by it. It's good to broaden people's knowledge that a larger population is affected by it," he said.

Sophomore Rachel Alexander is also involved with the project, echoed Hord's words.

"Whether you are black, white, gay, straight, male or female, it doesn't matter. [HIV/AIDS] is represented within every race, age, sect and gender," Alexander said. "It holds no boundaries."

Headline: Annual lecture tackles past, current racism
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
As he stood onstage behind the podium and in front of a room of about 50 people in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center at University Park, Colin A. Palmer delivered a speech promoting racial harmony and unity among the Caribbean countries in order to eradicate the racism of colonialism. 

Palmer's lecture, "Eric Williams and the Continuing Challenges of a Diverse Caribbean," was part of the 8th Annual Eric E. Williams Memorial Lecture honoring the late historian, politician and social activist. The event was held Oct. 6  and was  part of the 2006-2007 Distinguished Africana Scholars Lecture Series, which was put together by the African New World Studies at FIU.

Palmer's two key points in his lecture were the "continued efficacy of the notion of political and economic integration of the Carribean," and to "examine Eric Williams attitude towards race and to emphasize that Williams always believed that a healthy body politic depended upon racial equity."

"Some of the ideas that Eric Williams advocated, embraced and promoted during his long career are still very relevant to the modern Caribbean," he said.

During the lecture, Palmer said that Williams wanted people to "recognize the truth" about the "cancer" that exists in the Caribbean because the white mentality is still dominant there and it is oppressing the people.

"Such prejudices must be exorcised," Palmer said. "Williams maintained slavery was responsible for the ills of society. Poverty in the Caribbean wears a black and brown face."

Palmer went on to say that it's not only race issues that are keeping the Caribbean divided; sexism, homophobia, and other stereotypes should not exist.

 This is why Palmer stressed that the solution to racial division is sensitive and understanding leadership. Carole Boyce Davies, ANWS and English professor. She is responsible for developing the program at FIU and the lecture series. Davies hopes that students left the lecture with a better understanding of the importance of  who Williams was and what he stood for.

"There are people around the world who have made substantial contributions to their countries but he had another impact as a scholar because he was one of the first people to argue that there were economic reasons to slavery," she said.

Erica Williams Connell, the daughter of Williams, was a guest at the lecture. She said it was important to honor her father at the lecture not just because he was her father.

"It's important to honor a historian, an academic, a statesman for what he achieved politically for Trinidad and Tobago," she said.

Headline: ABORTION BATTLE
Subheadline: Clinic draws supporters, protestors
Author: Jackie Diaz . Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Every Saturday, Mary Salter drives to A Choice For Women, an abortion clinic in Kendall. 

When she arrives, she dispenses pamphlets, blocks the driveway and waves signs at oncoming traffic.

"We come out here to pray for the women who are coming here and their babies, the abortionist and their staff," said Salter, a leader of a pro-life group, which is composed of different parishes in Miami-Dade County. 

Their goal is to close down the clinic and stop women from getting abortions. 

"We want to provide a presence so the public knows this is an abortion clinic," she said.

Since the last week of May, pro-choice activists have gone out to the clinic, located on the 6660 block of 117th Ave, in Kendall, at 6:30 a.m. when the patients start arriving. 

They do this to make sure that access to the clinic is not blocked.

In response, Clinic Director Eileen Diamond searched for people to come out and help protect the patients. She contacted the Miami Clinic Access Project, which has helped women get safe access to abortion clinics since 1994.

MCAP's Julia Dawson, the clinic defense's main organizer, reached out to the Women Studies Student Association at FIU for help. 

Student members of the National Organization for Women, Bolivarian Youth and the local Miami Chapter of Planned Parenthood also got involved.

"[Since] they are upsetting people by putting up their signs, we want to put ours in front of theirs so people know that there are people who support a women's right to choose," said Beverly Thompson, professor and advisor of Women's Studies.

Salter believes they have been getting a positive reaction. 

"We've been successful at reaching out to women until the pro-choice people stopped us from doing that," she said. 

As of now, 170 pro-choice activists - including FIU students - have attended and some have returned several times, Dawson said.

"We will continue recruiting pro-choice activists to defend the clinic and make sure women have access to clinics safely without being harassed for what they are doing," Dawson said.

According to Dawson, it is not unusual for vandalism to occur during these types of protest, although none has take place at the Kendall clinic.

Mary Salter disagrees.  

"There are crazy people in any population. We are not violent. That's not our message. We are convinced that we're doing the Lord's work," she said. 

She explained that there are women in the pro-life group who have had abortions, but their goal is to reach women before they abort.

"We also help women after having an abortion," Salter said. "Through our program for forgiveness, Project Rachel, we offer private one-on-one counseling." 

Thompson believes it's crucial for people to understand that abortion rights are legal but are being chipped away. 

"The access to abortion is restricted in such a great manner that we really don't have the right," she said. "There are fewer doctors being trained in it and fewer clinics." 

Thompson is currently working on a documentary with Dawson and Diamond.

It will focus on what is taking place at A Choice for Women as well as incidents in the state and throughout the nation that deal with abortions.

 Sze Lee, president of WSSA, has taken part in the defense.

"It's important for people to understand that if you lose such rights it becomes an inequality for women because it's invading their privacy," she said. "Inequality for one is inequality for all."

Headline: Review ~ The Permice Brothers - Live a Little (Music)
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
In their fifth album Live a Little, the Pernice Brothers crank out another set of the same self-consciously sensitive, pretty-pretty soft pop ballads that have characterized their sound from their debut onward.

Mind you, this is not a bad thing. They specialize in mellow songs with soft vocals and even softer instrumentation that find life in an impeccable sense of melody.

The album's only crack shows up on the third track, "Cruelty to Animals," where Joe Pernice's fondness for literate, witty lyrics gets the better of him.

He pulls off his linguistic pirouettes without a hitch in the verses, where he marries big words with twirling melodies to impressive effects in lines like "Stunning as a taxidermy victim in a sliver cage/ I'm arrested by an aria brought from the country/ Struck dumb in a amazement like a dog who's told to levitate." 

Pernice stumbles in the chorus, where he gets a tad too precious, borrowing from French children's songs: "Allouette, gentile allouette…" Young children could choke on syrup that thick.

The album's second flaw is not in anything it does wrong, but instead in what it lacks. In Live a Little, the Pernice Brothers' music falls victim to its own elegance. What makes their music attractive is their meticulous arrangements and elegant tone, but the restraint those qualities require quells any emotion that lies behind the melody and the words. The Pernice Brothers' incapacity to loosen up makes the album at times feel uptight and irritatingly deliberate.

Overall, however, the Pernice Brothers are one of the few bands around today that can be counted on to deliver a consistent album of sophisticated, flawless pop gems, and Live a Little lives up to that promise.

Headline: Review ~ Anna in the Tropics (Theater)
Author: Angelina Esposito / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Suspense. Romance. Russia?

FIU's theatre department puts up Nilo Cruz's Pulitzer Prize winning play, "Anna in the Tropics." Directed by Wayne E. Robinson Jr., the play takes place in 1929 in a Cuban-American cigar factory in Tampa that still follows the hand-rolling tradition where lectors are hired to read to the workers to educate and entertain them as they roll.

It is with the arrival of a new lector, Juan Julian (Juan Espinosa) and his choice of literature, the romantic Russian novel "Anna Karenina," that romance and discord are sparked within the factory.

The owner, Santiago (Jose Grau), is the father of two rollers, Marela and Conchita (Deanne Saavedra and Maritxell Carrero) and husband to Ofelia (Emily J. Frail). Also, Santiago's half brother Cheche (Renier Murillo) holds a share in the factory and will take any chance to gain more power over Conchita's husband Palomo (Jose Urbino), who Conchita believes is unfaithful to her.

They are the typical family striving for the American dream and like most families they have their own dysfunctions, ranging from adultery to incest.

The show had a slow start and one or two line blunders, but after a short time the performance began to flow.

Each individual's performance was done well, but it's fair to say some outshone others.

Grau was wonderful, each time he came on stage the scene seemed to liven up and reach its potential. When paired with Frail, the two were a comedic duo bringing smiles and laughter amid the intense situations bubbling around them.

Carrero's performance went above and beyond; she dazzled when expressing Conchita's deep and, at times, conflicting emotions, especially toward Palomo. Carrero was also the fire in the passionate affair between Conchita and Juan Julian.

Palomo, while in the wrong - and perhaps getting his just desserts - demands sympathy. Urbino should be credited with the accomplishment of making Palomo seem like a victim, especially since the audience is already wary that he has - or had - a similar relationship with another woman. What woman would feel any remotely sympathetic emotion toward an unfaithful husband? Not many, but Urbino pulls it off.

The technical aspects complimented the show nicely with just some minor flaws.

The play's set was simple, nothing as elaborate as previous shows, and could have used more detail in some areas considering the closeness of the audience. The lighting worked well with the haze, never overpowering a scene but adding to it. Costumes were typical 1920s garb, as expected. Combined, everything created warm appeal adding to the tropical ambiance and rarely feeling like they were confined to a factory.

FIU's theater department has gone from avenging angels to heroine junkies; while "Anna in the Tropics" may not be any more light-hearted, it's still a refreshing change of pace, and though the play may have had some technical quirks it is still beyond worthy of the $8 to $10 ticket.

It's more than just a story about a Cuban-American family,  it's a look at human emotion: the need to be loved, the feelings of jealousy, and the dreams that help us face each new day.

Headline: Review ~ The Departed (Film)
Author: Reuben Periera / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
When Martin Scorsese's The Departed opens, we hear the classic chords of the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter" ringing in over the silhouette of mob boss Frank Costello walking within the shadows. A few moments later, he delivers one of the film's most memorable lines: "I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me." That's when I knew I was in for something very special.

Respected director Martin Scorsese has perhaps made some of the greatest, grittiest urban crime dramas and perfected his resume with masterpieces like Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Now he can add The Departed to that list. It's not only Scorsese's best work since Goodfellas; it's also one of the most sensational films I've seen in my life.

A remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, the film expands on the original in almost every way. Everything is better here, including the acting, the screenplay, the editing, the photography and of course, the direction. 

Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) start their lives on the streets of Boston. Costigan enrolls to become a state trooper with the intention of putting his rough past behind him. Sullivan also joins the force, but as a mole for mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello has been grooming Sullivan for his role ever since he was a child. According to Costello, cops and robbers are the same, and "…when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"

Costigan's assignment is to infiltrate Costello's inner circle and report his plans to superiors Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Meanwhile, Sullivan also leaks information to Costello leading to a tense cat and mouse game of smoking out the mole.

Damon, playing an unlikable character, is fantastic as the sneaky Sullivan who'd do anything to save himself. Wahlberg, as Costigan's superior, is magnificent in a relatively small but tough role. 

Nicholson steals scenes playing the showy "crazy Joe Pesci" role. As Costello, Nicholson is charismatic yet menacing. He hasn't been this terrifying since The Shining.

The real heart and soul of the film, however, is DiCaprio who is absolutely magnetic as Costigan. With this performance, he even tops his Oscar nominated turn in The Aviator. In every progressing scene, DiCaprio shows his talent, bringing out the fear and paranoia on Costigan's face.

William Monahan's rich, layered screenplay brings a depth that understands the Irish community, which is clearly evident in the style and dialogues delivered by the actors. I can't see it not getting an Oscar nomination.

The same goes to longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. The film seamlessly shifts between the two lead characters without the audience feeling the jumps, and it makes the film flow  despite a two and a half hour running time.

However, this is a Scorsese film and his fingerprints are all over it. His trademark moving camera is evident throughout the picture and this being a mafia film, so is the violence. Scenes with DiCaprio smashing a metal pole into a thug's face and Nicholson walking around shoulder deep in blood should make many cringe. 

Scorsese's trademark usage of songs to accentuate scenes is another highlight. The use of the Dropkick Murphy's "I'm Shipping Out To Boston" and Van Morrison's cover of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" show his knowledge of music and his mark as a true master.

When I realize that Ben Affleck, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Three 6 Mafia have Oscars and Scorsese doesn't, I come to a conclusion that he just doesn't need one. He's too good for it.

Headline: How to...a humor column
Subheadline: Easing the 'just friends' conversation
Author: Alicia Bustamante
&nbsp;
Sometimes, a lack of communication can cause complete chaos. Any encounter at a drive-thru or bank teller is a good example. Or when you tell your aging grandma "that's great banana bread" and she hears "great aunt Hanna's dead" and runs weeping into her room.

     However, there is no more delicate situation than when dealing with matters of the heart (or loins). Sometimes, relationships get too familiar for your taste and, albeit rarely, you have to tell someone you just don't dig them that way. 

    The reasons could be endless. You might not be ready for a relationship; find the person barely attractive (only with a bio-hazard suit on in the dark); or are saving yourself for Chuck Norris (what can I say, it's the Texas ranger chest hair).

     Whatever the reason, you have to nip these situations in the bud. Laying down and not standing up for yourself for the sake of someone's feelings can lead to greater emotional difficulties later on. Not to mention, that's how you can get herpes.

     There are easy ways to recognize when you might have to lay down the law. When you make a joke and the person laughs hysterically and then sighs while gazing at you lovingly is a good sign. Especially when you were just telling the person what the weather's like. 

     Another way is the infamous "too long hug." It's a subtle trick, but over time you'll notice that when the person hugs you goodbye, they're spending way too much time in the embrace - enough time to unhook a bra.

     The most obvious way, however, is when the person tries to make a deep personal connection with you by any means necessary. You could casually mention your dog is sick and the next day the person will come with vet-prescribed medicine, a dog acupuncture kit and a replacement dog just in case. It's at this point you have to devise an exit strategy.



"De-sexify"



One way to decrease your appeal is to make yourself asexual. Turtlenecks and parkas are a good apparel choice. If things get desperate, you could dress like a cardboard box, making your head look like that genie from "Pee-Wee's Playhouse." Plus, if you're in a box already you can ship yourself for a quick escape. Packing peanuts can make very comfortable bedding.



Distract



   There's no better way to get over one crush than to interest yourself with another. Start flooding your prospective suitor with links to hotties on Myspace, or you could do the philanthropic duty of physically finding another mate for your stalker. Consider someone from your workplace who's either in human resources or customer service.

   People who deal with the scourge of the earth all day aren't usually picky about mates. 



Disappear

 

     If you're the kind who likes to avoid confrontation, this is the easiest solution. Change desks or departments. If the suitor asks you what happened, you can just claim complete denial. "I've always had the desk in the stairwell," "No, this is not a wig" or "No hablo Ingles" are key phrases to remember. You could also join the witness protection program. Just tell the service you witnessed a criminal drop kicking a puppy or something and he wants you dead. They might just relocate you across town instead of the country.

    If these tools don't work, you could always just simplify and use the "hey, look over there!" trick. Just make sure the person doesn't hear "hey, look no underwear!" Good luck.

Subheadline: Students learn to channel anger, rage
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Bill Buchanan, current president of Student Programming Council, knows firsthand about learning the healthiest form of anger expression. After a heated verbal confrontation with another student, the Student Center for Conflict Resolution sent them both to 24 hours of anger management sessions. Buchanan feels that the Student Center was doing this out of precaution, and that they were only doing their job.

"While I was upset, I got in trouble for something I felt I didn't do. In a University setting, there's no room for that kind of behavior on either of our parts," Buchanan said.

Interpersonal conflict such as Buchanan's is just one example of circumstances that can set students' blood boiling. Anger can also take another form that some students can relate to: road rage.

Junior Maria Garcia explained what she sees as the source of road rage and just how it makes her react.

"People feel like they're entitled, like they own the road, like blinkers are just an accessory for [their] steering wheel," Garcia said. "It does make me angry, but if I try to cut them off, then I'll get in an accident and chances are I'll get the ticket and they won't. I limit it to yelling profanities in my car."

Other students, such as junior Prashant Parekh, get angry because of less tangible irritators.

"[What] would make me lose my temper is if some injustice is enacted," Parekh said.

The American Psychological Association calls anger a natural reaction to threats, a defense mechanism for when we are attacked. Learning how to use it productively and not harmfully then, is crucial. 

 Buchanan believes anger is a lack of cognition and explained how the first half of his sessions were about dissolving anger through understanding one's own thought processes. In a similar way, the APA recommends replacing thoughts of rage with logical thoughts. An example would be to not complain against circumstances by using the words "always" or "never," but instead to assess the situation more accurately. Along with this rational approach, they suggest more feelings-oriented techniques like picturing relaxing images and practicing yoga. Buchanan's classes incorporated such themes as well. 

"My second 10 hours were about spirituality," he said. "The types of anger you possess, and how you handle it through breathing techniques and meditation … People who are more stressed are going to be more angry."

  Dr. Seth Grossman, University psychologist at the Counseling Services Center, is in charge of screening students such as Buchanan who are referred by the Student Center of Conflict Resolution.

 "Our job is to determine if this was an isolated incident … where something flew out or if this person is an overall volatile person," Grossman said.  

Whatever Buchanan's mindset may have been upon first being sent to the sessions, he feels they were actually helpful, and even recommends them for those who may not think they need anger management. 

     "I went in pretty close-minded; I didn't think I was overly angry," he explained. "Many people have anger they don't even know they have because they suppress it. Emotionally, it kills you. I think [anger management] is beneficial for anyone." 

Dr. Grossman agrees. 

"[Close-minded] people might be good candidates for anger management as well. You can get better at something by gaining insight or knowledge." 

Other recommended ways of breaking free from anger are fine-tuning your communication skills, incorporating humor into tense situations and scheduling some time solely for yourself.

Headline: Students address poor handwriting
Author: Elayne Cardoso / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Before he started college, Leroy Adam had always struggled with his penmanship.

"I went through the school system without knowing how to properly hold a pencil until it was pointed out to me that it was being held wrong," said Adam.

Now a teacher at Bay Harbor Elementary in North Miami, Adam was inspired to write a children's book.

"Because of my love for writing and my experience as a teacher in the school system, I decided to write a story that students would enjoy and learn an important skill," he said.

Adam decided to collaborate with McSai Jean-Baptiste, senior education major at FIU and Schneyder Thelus, sophomore majoring in computer animation at Miami Dade College North.

They decided to create a children's story using rhyme, repetition, clear illustrations and language to help children in kindergarten through third grade  as they read and write.

 The end result was a 30-page book titled "Get a Grip, Patrick."  

The trio worked together to bring to life characters made to help and participate in order to better tackle the problem, according to Jean-Baptiste.

"It goes without question, that as educators its is imperative that we obtain as much information and skills as possible in order to be a dynamic force in our own classroom and 'Get a Grip Patrick' aspires to that creed," he said. 

 The story is about a pencil named Patrick and its owner Robert who does not know how to use the pencil because he has poor penmanship. 

The French crayon, the old and wise eraser, and the energetic white out are companions of Patrick who try to help understand the reason for Robert's poor handwriting, but only complicate the situation further.

At the same time, Patrick begins losing his eraser as he tries to find Robert a solution. 

"If you're not motivated to read your own handwriting then you would not be as motivated to read someone else's reading," he said.

The book has not been published, but students can look forward to the publication within the next few months. 

The trio plans to visit several elementary schools and host read-outs as well as engage in several activities that assist the students with their handwriting and their reading comprehension. 

Students will participate in learning how to properly hold the pencil through the tripod method, which means laying the pencil, like Robert, on their middle finger and pressing in with their thumb and index finger to obtain a better 'grip.'

The book might also be used for FCAT preparation once mandated by the Board of Education.

"To say the sky is limited would be an understatement: we want to take this project as far as we can," said Thelus.

Adam hopes this story will motivate students to understand of fine motor developments, hand-eye-coordination, posture and dexterity.

 "This is an excellent resource for teachers to use in the classroom to teach students a life long skill," Adam said.

Headline: Discussion surveys Islam
Author: Cedric Margron / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
About 30 students and staff members gathered in room 155 at BBC's Wolfe University Center to discuss the way Americans view the Islamic religion.  

Americans for Informed Democracy presented a town hall meeting, Oct. 3, regarding the future of U.S.-Islamic World Relations. 

As part of the discussion, AID brought guest speakers Katherine Gockel, program officer for policy analysis and dialogue at the Stanley Foundation and Areeb Naseer, legal director of the Council on American-Islamic relations.

According to Gockel, a main objectives was to define the way the American people associate Islam with the Middle East and the war in Iraq.

"Islam is not a negative thing, it is not what we see on television, and the American people tend to make clichés whenever they hear the word 'Islam'," Gockel said

"We need to understand the Islamic religion more in order [to] not associate it with the war in Iraq and other negative things." 

However this tendency doesn't only go for Americans, according to Gockel.

"The gap in perceptions is also in the Middle East, where people have different perceptions about America."

To give an illustration on how 9/11's negative effect on the Muslim world, Naseer commented on the face that the Council on American-Islamic relations used to receive two  civil reports on a daily basis.

Many showed discrimination, anti-Muslim incidents, hate crimes such as acts of violence, verbal attacks taking place mostly in schools, at work and in worship facilities.

After 9/11, that number increased to 15.

"9/11 created a belief that there's a clash of civilizations between the Americans and the people form the Middle East. Well, it's not true!" Naseer said.

 Naseer also stated that American leaders in politics tend to create negative word associations with Islam.

Although both speakers advocated the same topics, Gockel presented a worldwide view as opposed to Naseer's local views, according to one student.

"I thought that Naseer's dialogue was more efficient because he was more talking about the way it really affects Muslims here in America, whereas Gockel was talking about it in a more global aspect," said Pioneer Winter Jr., a junior majoring in psychology.

Both speakers concluded that to raise awareness to improve U.S.-Islamic relations, young Americans have to be educated through dialogues schools and universities.

 "We need to know how Islam is practiced here in America but also around the world and that has to be done throughout our educational system and also our leaders in politics," Gockel said.
