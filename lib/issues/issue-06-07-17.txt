Headline: Despite dumb act, Zidane is still respected
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."

Apparently they don't teach that in France, because Italian defender Marco Materazzi's words definitely hurt French superstar Zinedine Zidane. Which, in turn, caused Zidane to inflict physical pain right back.

Let's flash back now to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series - Boston Red Sox against the New York Mets. Tie ballgame with the Mets mounting a comeback rally and Mookie Wilson is standing at the plate.

After multiple foul balls, Wilson hits a seemingly routine ground ball to first base, which promptly rolled through the legs of Boston's Bill Buckner. 

That's right. That Bill Buckner. The Bill Buckner synonymous with choking and the Red Sox curse (prior to their 2004 World Series win that is).

The poor guy was lambasted by the local fans and media and was blamed for losing the series for Boston, even though Boston lost game seven of that series. In fact, Buckner and his family were harassed so much that he moved to Boise, Idaho and almost literally disappeared into obscurity. 

What many people don't know is that right before that ball rolled through his legs, Buckner was considered a very good player by those same Boston faithful. In fact, he was an All-Star in 1981 and won the National League Batting Title in 1980 - with the Chicago Cubs.

But a fine career, in which he amassed 2715 hits and a .289 batting average, was wiped clean with that one moment in 1986 and the ensuing taunts.

Which brings me back to Zidane. I thought he was definitely going to feel a wrath like that of Buckner - quite possibly worse. 

After all, it is the World Cup, which unlike the World Series, comes around every four years and is the only sporting event that many countries look forward to. Players have literally been killed for bonehead moves in the World Cup.

After Zidane's now-famous head butt, I was already feeling sorry for the guy. I thought his illustrious career which in a World Cup Title and three FIFA World Player of the Year awards, was going to be remembered by this one move.

I thought he would have (unjustifiably) been blamed for France's loss and his country would have disowned him, causing him to move to Europe's equivalent of Boise, Idaho.

The following day, absolutely nothing. I was expecting to see "Etu, Zizou?" headlines all over the French newspapers, but nothing.

They were actually lambasting Materazzi! Some newspapers, such as the BBC, hired lip readers in order to decipher what Materazzi said, in essence, trying to justify Zidane's actions.

I don't know how it works in the soccer world, but my understanding is that trash talking is a part of every sport. Even games played on X-Box are accompanied by trash talk. 

Whatever Materazzi said, regardless of what or whom it was about, should not have sparked such an absurd reaction.

I hate to sound like a parent, but all Materazzi threw were words. And I know I said I felt sorry for the guy, but in retrospect, Zidane terribly overreacted.

But it just goes to show you how respected he is when newspapers from Great Britain to Brazil are hiring lip readers in order to justify his actions. 

It may have been a stretch to compare Zidane to Buckner, but sports fans can be irrational. And with a stage as big as a World Cup final, it's a lot easier to judge and criticize. But there are some athletes, like Zidane, who supercede that irrationalism.

FIFA is looking into stripping Zidane of the Golden Ball, the award given to the World Cup's most valuable player. But I don't think they should. Zidane has made such a name for himself already that one absent-minded move shouldn't erase his legacy - or his outstanding performance in this World Cup, for that matter.

To prove another example of the respect Zidane's receives, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika told an African newspaper that he believed Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants, as "a World Cup demi-god" and the best footballer in the world.

Even more so, Materazzi himself said the French captain should not be striped of Golden Ball.

"He won it for what he did on the pitch," Materazzi told the Gazzetta dello Sport.

I guess the only way to avoid mass criticism is to be a World Class Superstar. 

Sorry, Buckner.

Headline: TOTAL EXPOSURE
Subheadline: Football team to have 10 games televised
Author:  Jaime Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It wasn't too long ago that catching FIU football games on television was a very tough task, if not impossible. Exposure was low because the team was not in Division I-A, so networks didn't find the team very appealing. 

This has drastically changed as the FIU football program has once again taken a giant step towards national recognition with its best television season since the inception of the program. Now that the team is accustomed to Division I-A football, networks have started taking a second look at coach Don Strock's program.

According to Athletic Director Rick Mello, 10 of the 12 Golden Panther games will be televised - including a soon to be announced internet webcast.

FIU opens its most promising season in school history with a game Aug. 31 at Middle Tennessee, which will be televised on ESPN Plus.

Some of the other notable games scheduled are a road game against North Texas (Oct. 7) and at home against Troy (Dec. 2) on the CSS network. 

Also, the Oct. 28 game at Alabama will be aired on the ESPN Gameplan and on a delayed basis on CSS.

The highly anticipated Oct. 14 game at the Orange Bowl against cross-town rival University of Miami will also be replayed on CSS.

And if that isn't enough, Strock is scheduled to make a guest appearance on CSS's "Sportsnite" July 31 at 6 p.m. 

The increased television exposure comes as great news to the FIU community.

 "It's absolutely great," said junior Daniel Perez. "When I first came to FIU, we didn't have any games on TV and now to have [more than] half, it's great for the school."

Freshman Juliana Lombana agrees that the extra attention is positive.

"With the School of Medicine approved and all these games on television, the entire country will know about Florida International University."

Mello also reflects the thoughts of the entire community with an added sense of accomplishment saying that this is also a huge window for the entire university. 

"One of the major goals we have in FIU athletics is to expose the University to a larger audience," Mello said. "This is simply remarkable. Having our Golden Panthers on the tube so constantly is almost like an infomercial. It keeps playing and playing until America will catch notice of the program."

Not only will FIU be exposed more than ever, the quality of the opponents should make for great television for any football fan. 

On Sept. 23, the Golden Panthers travel to famed Byrd Stadium in College Park, Md., home of the Maryland Terrapins - the 2001 Atlantic Coast Conference Championship and Orange Bowl finalists that same year. The game will also be shown on CSS at 6 p.m.

"This will only get better for FIU football," said Jennifer Henderson, assistant commissioner for the Sun Belt Conference.

For football fans in University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus, this is just the beginning.

With the team making progress, it is safe to say that games will be more exciting and the exposure for FIU will only get better every year, just like Henderson said.

Subheadline: Budget cuts hinder WRGP's potential
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It's been a month since Radiate FM, the University student radio station with call letters WRGP, installed a new transmitter. Located on top of the Green library at University Park, this new signal has a 15-mile radius from its point of origin, but more importantly, with the addition of yet another transmitter located on the Biscayne Bay Campus and the old signal stemming from the NBC tower in the Homestead area, the radio station will soon be heard all over Miami-Dade County and even in some parts of Broward.

The humble radio station, which was launched in 1984, has probably grown the most in the past few months than it has in the past 22 years - at least in terms of its physical reach and influence on the airways. 

Also, the Miami New Times recently rated it as the best radio station in the city in the publication's "Best of Miami," something that the employees of WRGP proudly show off on the door of the station's second floor Graham Center offices.

Even with the good news of the past few months, the station still has its share of problems. Ignorant critics of the station argue that its programming does not appeal to the masses. 

They overlook the fact that the station's programming is not geared to appeal to the average Y-100 or Power 96 listener. 

The very fact that the programming does not appeal to the multitudes of loyal listeners of mainstream music, but instead to underground artists and the local music scene, should be seen as a success rather than a failure, as this has been the station's key demographic from the beginning.

"We're not looking to be Clear Channel," say's Brennan Forsyth, WRGP general manager, referring to the communications behemoth which owns up to seven commercial radio stations in the Miami area alone, including local favorites such as Y-100.7, Mega 94.9 and 103.5 The Beat - just to name a few.

Programming critiques may be the least of WRGP's worries, however, if the Student Government Association continues its trend of cutting the station's budget. In the past three years, the budget has been cut by $25,000, leaving it with a measly $100,000 that it must be divided between payroll and the maintenance of its three transmitters.

After all is said and done, WRGP is left with virtually no money to spend on all those little things - things such as promoting and marketing. 

Even though it has already been a month since the station can be heard at UP, no one has noticed. It is essentail the station have funds to promote itself to the student body. 

It is interesting to note that WRGP had a greater budget last year, when it only had to maintain one transmitter, than it has this year, when it has to worry about the maintenance of three transmitters.

Obviously SGA has not considered what an asset the station may actually be to the University and students alike - especially during times of crisis, like when South Florida is threatened by a hurricane, when many students are without electricity, need to be informed of school closures and only have a battery powered radio handy.

The bottom line is that the radio is here for students and should not be treated as a thorn in the side of SGA, as seems to be the case. All things aside, however, it is the responsibility of the students to tune-in and make WRGP the success that it certainly has the potential to be.

Subheadline: Frustration, questions abound in shuttle ticket increase
Author: Brandon A. Campbell / WUC Employee
&nbsp;
I am an employee at the Wolfe University Center in the Biscayne Bay Campus. On July 12, I went to the WUC to clock in for my daily shift, when I noticed a flyer posted on the information desk stating that they were currently out of 10-trip and 30-trip shuttle tickets. 

In the July 10 issue of the Beacon, the front page story was all about the fact that the shuttle tickets would increase by one dollar per round trip. 

I figured that many students had taken the opportunity to buy shuttle tickets that day while they were still only $3 dollars for a round trip, but I took it upon myself to check the drawer where the tickets were kept, to see for myself how many were left since I was going to buy some myself, and I noticed that there, bundled up neatly, was a stack of 10-trip tickets. 

So in fact, they were not out of the 10-trip tickets; either they were simply refusing to sell them, or the staff at the information desk was forced to lie to customers. 

To my dismay, I realized that the only logical conclusion was that they wanted to retain the shuttle tickets to sell them later, at the more expensive rate, for a better profit. This is the ultimate slap in the face for the students of FIU, whom I know for a fact had intensions of buying large bundles of shuttle tickets to avoid paying the increase, as it is their right to do so. 

I also find that this increase, as well as the last increase both took place in the summer semesters - perhaps when fewer students are present to complain? Things to think about, FIU.

Headline: Hype over North Korean test launches excessive, unfounded
Author: Jose Carlos de Witt / Assistant Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
The hype about the recent North Korean missile tests is nothing more than exactly that: a lot of hype. The premise behind all the ruckus is that if North Korea, being the rogue totalitarian nation that it is, has started to test its Taepodong 2 long-range missiles, that has got to be a scary thing, right? 

The North Koreans dislike America to begin with, and if they wake up tomorrow morning and decide they have some beef with us, they could very well bombard us with nuclear or biological weapons on a whim. Well, not really.

The only thing that is true about the above statement is that North Korea tested some missiles recently. Beyond that, there is only uncertainty, exaggeration and fear-mongering.

First off, U.S. military intelligence has admitted that the information they have about the missiles being tested is limited, at best. 

They do not know how many stages these missiles have, how they get from one place to another or what range they are capable of covering. 

Second, if our intelligence agencies are not sure whether the missiles are capable of reaching U.S. soil, we do know for sure that they are not. In fact, the missile tests failed miserably: they did not get very far, and they ended up crashing in the sea. One thing we do know about North Korean missile technology is that much of it dates back to the 1940s. 

What is much scarier than the actual missile tests is the response they have received. The media has responded in its characteristic paranoid frenzy. 

The Bush administration mustered its usual bravado, what with threats of economic sanctions and assurances that we could have shot it down. Japan, who might actually have reason for concern, has had the most aggressive reaction, with threats of preemptive strikes and ratcheting up its military capabilities. 

Finally, China, which has traditionally been an ally to North Korea, has mostly stayed silent on the issue. The few comments Beijing has made so far have been asking for the international community to avoid "overreacting." In this case, I believe China has had the most sensible attitude so far. 

We are not done in Iraq yet and Afghanistan still requires our attention. Rather than jump hastily to arms and commit ourselves to another military conflict, we should verify whether North Korea is actually a threat to us and, for once, analyze the situation with a cool and rational mentality.

Headline: Saudi ambassador visits campus
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On July 13, FIU hosted Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, who met with students and faculty to discuss a wide range of topics related to international current events in the Graham Center at University Park.

"Saudi Arabia is a fairly new country, but in a very short time, we've accomplished a great deal," the ambassador said. "Over the years, we have served humanity because of our place as the home of the Islamic faith," he said.

"Because of our strategic geopolitical location, and because of our energy reserves, and also because we're a full contributing member of the global community."

Prince Turki's visit was planned and arranged by FIU's Governmental Relations Department after they had been offered the opportunity by Florida Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart.  

"I was the one who received a call from [the congressman's] office asking if we would like to have the prince come and visit with us this evening," said Federal Relations Director Susan Moya.  "I said, 'Absolutely, categorically, yes.'"

According to Prince Turki, between 10 and 12 million Muslims worldwide make annual pilgrimages to Mecca.

Saudi Arabia established a relationship with the United States in the 1950s to combat Communism, and Saudi Arabia remains a staunch American ally in the Middle East.

"What began with the construction of the U.S. airbase in Dhahran, which hosted American forces as part of the containment of the former Soviet Union, grew into a partnership to include and to ensure global security and stability," Prince Turki said.

Prince Turki, the youngest son of the late King Faisal and a graduate of Georgetown University in Washington D.C., became ambassador to the United States in December 2005.  Prior to this appointment, he had served as the Director General of Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Directorate from 1977 to 2001, and became Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2003.    

Prince Turki's lecture lasted  approximately ten minutes, highlighting the accomplishments of Saudi Arabia and its economic, political and social progress of the past several decades, while noting the kingdom's stability throughout times of change.  

 "I believe the kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] has been able to achieve this," Prince Turki said. "But it has only come as a result of our efforts to actively work for peace and stability."

Prince Turki's comments were followed by a question and answer period, moderated by Dr. Charles MacDonald, FIU's chair of International Relations.  

The questions covered topics, including Saudi Arabia's role in fighting terrorism, its relationships with the United States and Israel, the role of education, democracy and the rights of women in Saudi society, and the issue of Saudi identity.

"By ethnicity, Arabs originated in Saudi Arabia, and that gives us a special place in history, culture, and the ethos of the Arabs," Prince Turki said, responding to a question about the Saudi sense of identity.  "The other characteristic that is unique to Saudi Arabia is the fact that it is the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and the religion of Islam."  

Students enjoyed Prince Turki's speech. 

"I think it was extremely informative," said senior Adam Neil Perl, an international relations major who is focusing on Middle Eastern studies. "I think it gives you more of an insight into the country of Saudi Arabia, which you don't feel from the textbooks, 'cause you get a firsthand answer."

Senior Jan Solomon agreed.

"Overall, he's a very eloquent speaker, and quite a diplomat," said Solomon, who is a doctoral student and administrator of the International Relations Department's Middle East Society.  

"He doesn't really go into any heavy duty issues, anything controversial, and I think that's his job. as an ambassador."

Headline: Student radio station expands signal at University Park
Author: Rocio Perez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After years of being heard only in Homestead and online, Radiate FM, the FIU student radio station, got the ultimate make-over: it's now broadcasting from a new signal - 95.3 FM. 

The station, which has call letters WRGP, has made significant improvements in spite of having its budget decreased by the Student Government Association from $125,000 to $100,000 over the past three years.

Obtaining the new signal has been challenging, according to Brennan Forsyth, general manager of Radiate FM. 

Since its inception in 1984, WRGP (then called KFIU AM radio) has endured numerous changes, including the recent addition of two new transmitters, one on top of the Green Library at University Park and another at the Marine Sciences building at the Biscayne Bay Campus to rebroadcast the 88.1 FM signal in different frequencies.

The station features a wide selection of music, innovative schedules and the latest technology for students listening pleasure. Most importantly however, this radio station will be a driving force in creating a sense of unity and identity between the FIU community and Miami, according to Forsyth.

The radio station lounge, located on the second floor of GC, holds a comfortable couch, music posters lining the walls, a gaming-ready projector, and even a huge stuffed tomato, all helping to create  a laid-back atmosphere. 

However, Forsyth assures that these 30 radio DJs, as well as Music Director Cynthia Carrillo, all share an intense passion for music. 

"Having this much fun should not be legal," Forsyth said, from his poster-covered office.

The current focus of the radio station is to create a balance of musical genres, giving each student the opportunity to listen in on their favorite day according to their preference. Hip-hop is played on Saturdays and Mondays; local rappers are played on Saturdays. Experimental music is played on Tuesdays, and house/industrial is played on Fridays. Wednesdays feature rock, classic 80s, and greatest hits. Sundays are world-day-when they play anything from salsa to reggae.

The radio station also features a FIU news show called News Talk that is broadcast Fridays at 9 a.m. It is a student-run show that tackles issues that affect FIU students. WRGP partnered with The Beacon and created one student-media news department to provide students with the most up-to-date University news.

"The station's vision is to continue running as a professional organization while offering programming students won't find on other South Florida radio stations," Forsyth said. "Too many stations now determine programming by using market research."

Sophomore Jackie Gadea enjoys the station because it plays underground music and gives exposure to young talents. 

"The best thing about Radiate FM is that it's for the students and run by students," Gadea said. "This isn't Clear Channel where what's played on the air is controlled."

Forsyth agrees.

"We're not looking to be Clear Channel," Forsyth said. "Some stations have been playing the same songs for 10 years, and others repeat the same programs on a daily or weekly basis."  

Additionally, UP-SGA plans to host an on-air forum discussing student issues, something that current UP-SGA president Alfonso Leon is very excited about.

"We plan on having a talk show for student issues where students can talk to the SGA about questions they have as well as getting information on what's happening with events on campus," Leon said.

For now, promotion is WRGP's first priority. Efforts remain mainly grass roots. They include T-shirts, flyers, a website (http://wrgp.fiu.edu) and a MySpace page (www.myspace.com/radiatefm). 

Few students are aware that WRGP has existed in some form or fashion for more than 20 years because many decisions were made in the past that adversely affected the radio station, according to Forsyth. 

"Although we know that many people have fought to promote the station's interests, certain individuals have given priority to their personal endeavors. This has not only slowed down the station's growth, but has left a lot of work to be done," Forsyth said.

Although Forsyth predicts a bright future for WRGP, the Miami New Times has already named it as the Best Radio Station in Miami in its annual Best of Miami issue, something that not many stations can boast.

Headline: A Fond Farewell
Subheadline: BBC Vice Provost Moncarz retires after 34 years
Author: Carla St. Louis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In an intimate gathering of about 50 students, faculty and staff, Biscayne Bay Campus Vice Provost Raul Moncarz said farewell to FIU.

Along with his wife Elisa and son Philippe, the group gathered at the BBC Wolfe University Center July 12 to honor the life and work that Moncarz devoted to the campus over his more than 30 years at  the University.

BBC Student Government Association President Camilo Silva's words entertained the crowd and brought a smile to Moncarz's face.

"This is your day," Silva said. "Since the day I looked into your eyes and you looked into mine, I knew that together we were going to do something great at this campus." 

 SGA also created a video slideshow that showcased the organization's members and University faculty recalling their personal narratives with Moncarz.

He bowed his head several times in acknoledgement during the airing of the video slideshow.

Moncarz's tenure at FIU ends July 31. Moncarz recalled his sentiments when he was bestowed vice provost at BBC in the late 1990's.

"I was honored," he said. 

Pamela St. Fleur, vice president of BBC-SGA, presented Moncarz with a plaque recognizing his excellent commitment in leadership and his contributions to FIU.

This award becomes one of many in Moncarz's collection. 

Throughout his career he has earned over 30 numerous state and national honors including the prestigious Fulbright scholarship.

 Moncarz considers his stewardship of BBC his most fulfilling moment. In the process, he has cultivated relationships with the FIU community, specifically with the students.

"Of all the people I've worked with at FIU including faculty, he's been the one person who has worked 100 percent for the students," said Rachel Caines, Academics Affair chair of SGA at BBC. 

He considers students' the most important factor in a successful university. 

"The most important asset to Florida International University - today and in the future - are the students," Moncarz said.

He earned a doctorate in finance at Florida State University and made it his life's mission to share his knowledge.

He wrote articles for Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics, Florida Journal of International Law and Emerging Capital Markets in Latin America. He has published more than 100 articles. 

Moncarz is also a renowned lecturer and consultant, sharing his ideas about the Caribbean and Latin America. 

Rolda Serieux, secretary at the vice provost's office, has worked closely with Moncarz. 

"Dr. Moncarz taught me a great deal about [being] persistent," she said. "According to him, obstacles do not exist."

Gregory Wolfe, former FIU president from 1979 to 1986 said that Moncarz envisioned a campus   with more potentional than his colleagues were willing to acknowledge.

"This campus, which has far more beauty and potential with its budding real estate is under realized; however, Moncarz saw an opportunity with this campus," Wolfe said. 

Moncarz will continue his involvement at the university with the Jose Marti scholarship fund.

He will also continue his position as president-elect of the International Trade and Finance Association. He hopes to bring the organization's next global meeting to Miami next year.

But before getting back to work, Moncarz and his wife will take a cruise vacation. 

"I hope my husband's legacy continues for years to come," said his wife Elisa Moncarz, a professor at the School of Hospitality and Management. 

A task force, on which Vice President of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education Rosa Jones will sit, was created to find Moncarz's successor. 

Before the end of the ceremony, Moncarz explained the significance of BBC. 

"It is imperative to note that the future of Florida International University is at the Biscayne Bay Campus. People need to understand that the Biscayne Bay Campus is part of a system."

Headline: Painter portrays self in artwork
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The Loch Ness Monster and military helicopters are a few of the random elements that senior Lizzie Gonzalez paints into her artworks. 

"I throw in random things to confuse people," she said. "However, the add-ins are really meant to click in people's minds as something they recognize, which may trigger a memory or thought."

When she was 14 years old, Gonzalez realized that she had the ability to paint well. Since then, she has done what she enjoys most: create art. 

At first, art was a hobby of hers; it was simply something that she enjoyed doing. Years later, she will be graduating from FIU this December with a bachelor's in Fine Arts with a concentration in painting.

While Gonzalez has painted plenty of works since she first started taking art classes at Coral Park High School, she has been focusing on her latest series Interactions, which was shown at the Hugin and Munin Gallery at Biscayne Bay Campus this past June. The series depicts characters of different sizes interacting in various manners. 

One painting, known as Meet, shows two characters meeting each other. However, one of the persons is tiny and stands on the palm of the other's hand. If admirers look closely enough, they'll notice that the smaller person is actually Gonzalez.

"I'm normally the model for my paintings," she said. 

The idea for the Interactions series developed from one of Gonzalez's paintings, a work that focused on a pair of large feet. Colleagues who examined the painting during class critiques noted that the painting seemed "monumental."  This monumental aspect influenced her decision to start her newest series.

"The general public notion is that hands and faces are expressive and other parts, like feet, are not considered expressive when reading body language. I believe that feet can also be expressive, so I focused on feet for that particular painting," she said. 

To develop ideas for her art, Gonzalez turns to pop culture. 

"Pop culture in general is a big influence in my works," Gonzalez said. "Objects I see, such as red sweatshirts, have made their way into my paintings. One painting I have has a giant character holding a magnifying glass on a tiny person during a sunny day. Common knowledge such as being able to burn an ant that way is something that influenced that work." 

Before starting a new painting, Gonzalez prepares by taking 30 to 40 pictures of herself and creates a general layout in her head about what she wants to do with the painting.

"Although I have a general idea of what I want to do, I start painting, and some things end up changing such as backgrounds and positions," Gonzalez said. "Something might start out as being higher and then end up lower." 

According to Gonzalez, the larger paintings in the series have taken about a month to complete. Smaller portraits, however, have taken as little as four to five days to finish. 

With just a few months left before graduation, Gonzalez has a busy schedule ahead of herself. 

This September and October, her artwork will be shown at the Miami Beach City Hall Gallery with works by other artists such as Jessica Gispert and Vicenta Casan. 

In addition to having her works displayed later this year, she will soon be getting married. 

She is currently engaged to an architecture major who has supported her passion and aided her with some of her paintings.

"My fiancé helps me by taking the pictures for my art," Gonzalez said. 

Even with all the widespread exposure she has been receiving, Gonzalez has not forgotten about the artists who have influenced her work.

"Many artists have affected my techniques and style," she said. "Jenny Saville is one artist who influenced my works. Also, Lucian Freud and Margherita Manzelli can be added to my list of artistic inspirations." 

Two University faculty members have also played a large role in her art: Geoffrey Olson and Clive King.

"They've helped me in things ranging from technical painting issues to compositional layouts," she said. "I owe them a lot."

Headline: University greenhouse displays 400 plant species
Author: Maria Chercoles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Contrary to common belief, the FIU Wertheim Conservatory Glasshouse, known to students as simply the greenhouse, is open to anyone, not just biology students. It remains as one of the few unknown cool hangout places in the university. 

The greenhouse, which is located next to the Engineering and Computer Sciences building at University Park, is run by the Biological Sciences Department as part of the Herbert and Nicole Wertheim Conservatory Complex, also called WC. The complex exhibits 400 plant species in total between the main greenhouse and two smaller greenhouses.

 "Many students use the greenhouse for their own research projects," said graduate student Jed Redwine, majoring in plantology. "For more than three years I used leaf litter traps there to collect leaves from 10 different species, which allowed me to study forest composition changes over time and its consequences to the forest and animals."  

Steve Turner has been the Greenhouse Coordinator since the complex opening almost 10 years ago, and with proper scheduling, he is always glad to give students a guided tour. 

Turner's tour begins at the Wertheim Conservatory, the most noticeable construction of the complex, which exhibits more than 100 species from across the globe. Most of them are kept inside the greenhouse because they require tropical rain forest temperatures and humidity. 

"Most rain forest plants need acid soil, so we try to keep a low pH, meaning high acidity," Turner said. "These plants probably wouldn't survive our dry winters if planted outdoors."

Most plants are brought to the conservatory by professors from their research expeditions, such as the exotic Malaysian spikemoss, whose leaves change from blue to green depending on which direction the light strikes it; or the leafless Costa Rican shingle vine, which grows along the floor and away from sunlight. Once the vine reaches the base of a tree, it grows round-shaped leaves tightly against the tree's trunk that change to long and palm-like, separating from the tree. Other notable species include a African cherry tree, a Costa Rican terrestrial orchid, and a variety of Australian and Malaysian tree ferns. 

The main greenhouse is very interesting, but a visit to the Conservatory Complex is not complete without visiting the two smaller greenhouses inside the building. Opposite the main greenhouse, where plants are kept only for exhibition purposes, are two smaller greenhouses, where students and professors carry out their studies and experiments. Together, they house over 300 plant species.

The first greenhouse contains a large collection of cacti and succulents, orchids, ferns, and other plants used for biology classes.

"People tend to think any succulent plant is a cactus," Turner said, "but cacti only grow throughout America, while the majority of succulents come from Africa, and many do not have spines like cactus. Succulents have become more popular now that they are available over the Internet." 

 Two other interesting plants are the ant plants: viny bulbous Dischidia  and Myrmecodia, both from East Asia. These curious plants shelter ants inside their hollow, bulb-like stem. 

In return, the ants provide the plants with organic matter and protect them by keeping insects away.

Another plant to check out is the club moss or Lycopodium, which may look like a regular fern, but is actually one of the most primitive plants on Earth.  

"Relatives of these Lycopods have been around since the dinosaurs' time," Turner said. "There are fossil records showing they existed over 200 million years ago."   

The last part of the visit features the second small greenhouse where plants are kept for research projects.

Most research relates to the preservation of endangered native plants. An ongoing project involves finding a way to eradicate a plant named the Brazilian pepper from the Everglades; the plant is overcrowding native plants. 

"The Brazilian pepper was first sold at nurseries as an ornamental plant," Turner said. "But soon birds disseminated its seeds throughout the region, producing changes in the ecosystem."

Turner, who studied ornamental horticulture, provides visitors with a fascinating and knowledgeable description of each plant's story and reason for being there. The greenhouse is definitely worth a visit and anyone can learn something from the experience. 

It is open Monday-Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. For a guided tour call (305) 348-7316.

Headline: Late Night Munchies
Subheadline: Students seek late night restaurants after night of music, dancing
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's 4 a.m., and you have a bunch of hungry friends in the car with you.  After a long night of being the designated driver, all you can think of is getting your buds home and collapsing into the comfort of your own bed but a slight rumbling in your belly tells you that maybe it isn't such a bad idea to pull over and grab a bite to eat.  

Where do you go to at this hour for something greasy, cheap and legal? If you're tired of paying for an $8 plate - and don't forget the tip - at some shady diner or waiting at a Denny's that's filled past its capacity, then you could use a little heads-up on some places that can help bring a tasty and inexpensive end to your crazy night out in the city.


Ernesto's Tacos:
In L.A., authentic Mexican cuisine is ubiquitous, tasty, fast and cheap. In Miami, you can pay $12 for a burrito from a place where not even the salt-shakers are made in Mexico -- and you'll wait 30 minutes for it. That's only true until you take yourself to Ernesto's Tacos. The restaurant almost feels like it doesn't belong there, but that's because once you're inside you'll find great Mexican food at prices that are hard to come by in these parts. 

"They have really good chimichangas that are delicious if you don't mind feeling like your stomach is about to explode from eating so much," said junior Wendy Corrales. 

If you really want to complete your meal, a drink of horchata (or any drink for that matter) is only $1.50.

Hours: open 24 hours  

Location: 8845 SW 107th Avenue


Los Perros:
Going home after blowing most of your money at a club is for quitters, and at this convenient location off 42nd Street, Los Perros knows this very well.  The people here understand their customers better than anyone, and they also know that sitting down with your friends recounting the night is donde la rumba empieza, or "where the party starts." While you dig into a Colombian hot dog topped with pineapple, club music keeps the party going - even if it's not exactly your brand of music, it's the thought that counts.  

"The hot dogs are huge and stacked with onions and everything you could want on it," said senior Kathy Rengal.  "You can get one of those really cheap and have some arepas on the side."  

Arepas, a popular favorite at Los Perros, are corn patties that can be topped cheese.

Hours: Monday-Wednesday from noon to 3 a.m., and Thursday to Sunday from noon to 6 a.m. 

Location: 13313 SW 42nd Street


La Colina:
What started as a small stand in Doral is now Parador de la Colina, a modest eatery that serves the most familiar snacks, hot dogs and burgers for under $6, as well as ethnic foods that pay homage to popular South American staples such as the patacon, or banana chips, which are fried down to a flat crisp and salted for flavor.  

They also have imported soft-drinks, such as the Nicaraguan red soda pop Milca and Venezuelan Frescolita if you're bored of the usual Coke and Pepsi options. 

The best thing about La Colina is its location, which is barely a 5-minute drive from FIU. The restaurant is never out of the way if you're heading back to campus. 

Hours: Friday-Saturday from 4 p.m. to 6 a.m. and Sunday to Thursday from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.

Location: 11200 W Flagler Street 


Mystic Pita:
What would Paris Hilton eat?  When she takes time off from her acting career, Hilton and her friends have been spotted enjoying pitas and gyros at Mystic Pita's location on Washington Avenue in South Beach, near SkyBar.  

For under $6, you can enjoy great Greek dishes while staring at a wall adorned with pictures of the restaurant owner posing with various celebrities who have visited his venue before.  

"I remember sitting there once and we saw Rod Stewart's daughter munching on hummus and pita with her boyfriend," said sophomore Gabriel Pantoja. "Part of me wanted to pretend she wasn't there and part of me wanted to bust out laughing."  

Mystic Pita is a great choice for an experience out of the ordinary

Hours: Sunday-Thursday 11 a.m. to Midnight and Friday to Saturday from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Location: 1564 Washington Avenue
