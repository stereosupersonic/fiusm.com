Headline: Former ace discusses new life as pro

David Asher is living a dream. 

After being selected in the eighth round by the Seattle Mariners, Asher is one step closer to what he's always wanted since his childhood.

However, getting closer to his dream has taken him over 3,000 miles away from home until early September.

Now with the  Everett AquaSox, the Mariner's short-season Class A affiliate in Washington, Asher will spend the next few months traveling on bus around the Pacific Northwest to face other minor league teams. 
But despite his hectic travel schedule, Asher still had time to talk about his thoughts on the draft, how he faces minor league hitters and his future plans as a baseball player.

Q: What was the first thing that went through your mind when you were selected?
Finally, it's over. The waiting was just brutal. I wasn't even watching when I got picked. My brother was the one who told me I got picked and I was relieved.

Q: What is biggest difference between playing in college and playing in the minor leagues? 
From a positive standpoint, you don't have to wake up and go to class. You just wake up and go straight to the field. On the negative side, I went from being a starter to a reliever. So now I have to be throwing everyday, whereas at FIU, I would only throw one day a week. My arm just gets really tired.

Q: What adjustments have you made to deal with pro batters as opposed to the college batters you used to face?
Well, the guys I'm facing now are college guys - guys who were just drafted. So the quality of batters is just the same as I faced in college, except that now, they don't have aluminum bats; they have wood ones.

Q: What are the differences when facing a batter with a wood bat as opposed to a batter with an aluminum bat?
You can pitch inside more and break some bats. With an aluminum bat, those inside pitches can be turned into cheap hits.

Q: How do you manage being so far away from home for such a long period of time?
I really didn't have too much time to think about it. I left to Washington the day after I signed my contract. As long as we keep playing everyday, time will go by fast and I won't have to worry about it.

Q: What was the first thing you bought with the signing bonus money you received?
Nothing, because I haven't gotten the check yet. But when I do, I'm gonna give some of it to my parents and just save the rest. I won't start spending until I make it to the big league.

Q: What time frame do you give yourself to reach the major leagues?
I say two to three years. So I can have time to learn some new things. I'm very competitive, so as long as I keep throwing strikes and getting guys out, I'll make it in my time frame.

Q: If you don't make it to the majors in the time you hope, would you continue to battle it out in the minors?
If after three years I see that I'm not moving up or if I stay at level for a while, I will leave. I love the game of baseball, but it would be too much to have to do some of the things you hate about the game for the little amount of money a minor leaguer gets.

Q: In 10 years, how much will a David Asher rookie card be worth?
I don't know. It depends on how much you'll pay me.

Headline: University establishes Athletics Hall of Fame
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Looking to be a more traditional university where athletic programs dominate the campus circuit, Athletic director Rick Mello announced a plan last week for the creation of an FIU Athletics Hall of Fame. The induction of its first class will take place in the spring of 2006.

"The many student-athletes that have come through our program have been a source of great pride to our university and the South Florida community. With the creation of the FIU Athletics Hall of Fame, we now have a vehicle to honor the men and women who have laid the groundwork for this up-and-coming intercollegiate athletic program," Mello said.

To qualify for selection into the Hall of Fame, a student-athlete must have excelled at the intercollegiate level for FIU. 

The student-athlete's four years of athletic eligibility must have ended a minimum of 10 years ago, meaning the first class must be from 1995-96 or before.

Coaches and athletic directors are also eligible for induction 10 years after beginning their tenure at the university.

 Amongst the current head coaches who could be inducted as early as next year, is current men's soccer coach Karl Kremser. 

Kremser, a 30-year veteran, has over 300 career victories and led FIU to its first national championship of any sort in 1982. He also led his team to the NCAA finals three more times --1984, 1985 and 1996.
Under the sponsorship of the FIU Foundation, Inc. and Panther Athletic Club, a hall of fame committee, is being assembled to select the student-athletes and coaches.

It will consist of Tony Argiz, a member of FIU's inaugural baseball team and the CEO/Managing Partner of Morrison, Brown, Argiz & Farra, LLP accounting firm has agreed to be the committee's first-ever chairman. Rich Kelch, the university's assistant athletic director for media relations will serve as co-chairman.

A maximum of five honorees will be inducted into the FIU Athletics Hall of Fame each year. The committee plans to announce the inaugural inductee class later this year. An honors banquet will take place in April or May of 2006.

"The chance to formally recognize and think our future Hall of Fame inductees is an exciting concept and the start of another tradition at this vibrant, young institution that we hope will be embraced by the entire FIU community," Mello said.

The university has made nominations for the first class open to the public. An on-line nomination ballot has been created at www.fiusports.com/halloffame.

Headline: Mediocrity not acceptable for talented Marlins
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A recurring theme in Major League Baseball is that one cannot judge a team's success simply by the names on its rosters.  Before the start of every season, we make our predictions and try to figure out who the favorites are, but it just so happens that every year we are sorely mistaken.

This year, Ozzie Guillen's no-name Chicago White Sox sit atop of the AL Central while George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees eat up dollars like a garbage disposal and lie in third place in their division.  

Coming into the season, the Marlins seemed destined for mediocrity. They failed to resign Cy-Young candidate Carl Pavano and didn't make any additions to strengthen their team.  Then one day, slugging first baseman Carlos Delgado came knocking at the door and all of a sudden, we were bound for our third World Series championship. 

I'll be the  first to say that I too considered him the "final piece of the puzzle" and the "missing link" to a perfect ball club.  But once again, I got caught in the same web so many of us get trapped in - the uncertainty of baseball.

With the month of June concluded, the Marlins stood five games out of first place behind the Washington Nationals, in one of the most competitive divisions in all of baseball.  Now, as we close into the All-Star Break, here's a report card of the Marlins hitting and pitching thus far.

HITTING: C-

The fish came into the season with very high expectations on offense. Delgado brought the much-needed power to a lineup that lacked strength in the middle.

The problem I see with their hitting is that they have not established their genetic makeup. Their success in 2003 (the year the Marlins won their second championship) was built on speed, getting on base and timely hitting with runners in scoring position.  

This year, they have both the speed and the power; the problem is they do not know how to use them.

Juan Pierre, the most important person in the lineup, is hitting in the mid .200s and has not had the opportunity to utilize his great speed.
Hitting behind sluggers Miguel Cabrera and Carlos Delgado, Mike Lowell and Paul Lo Duca are very important in the run production of this ball club.  Combined, however, they currently have five home runs and less than 60 RBIs.

Despite their current lack of support, Luis Castillo has bounced back from a rough start and raised his average over .300. 

Miguel Cabrera is having an All-Star season and Carlos Delgado is putting up his usual numbers.  Look for the Marlins to turn up their inconsistent offense as Lo Duca, Lowell and Pierre get going.  You know they're not going to stay quiet for too long.

STARTING PITCHING: B+

The biggest question mark coming into this season was how the starting rotation was going to hold up with its history of injury.  

So far, Dontrelle Willis is putting up incredible numbers, AJ Burnett is seventh in the league in strikeouts and Josh Beckett is coming into his own and settling back to the pitcher he was in 2003.

Sure, Al Leiter has had his bumps on the road and Ismael Valdez is still on the DL, but Leiter's stuff will come back and Brian Mohler has done a fine job replacing Valdez.

This rotation is among the best in the game and if they can get a little bit more help from the fourth and fifth starters, it will carry them to another playoff berth.
	
BULLPEN: D

Injuries have been a key factor in the mediocrity of the bullpen thus far.  
Early in the season, Antonio Alfonseca and Tim Spooneybarger went down with injuries and depleted a good chunk of their late-innings relief.  
And with Guillermo Mota's struggles at the closer position, Todd Jones has had to fit into a role that may not be suitable for him in this stage of his career. 

The staff will soon get Spooneybarger back, giving them a good option for set up man, but long reliever struggles and a lack of guys for the late innings are a big reason why the ball club is flirting with a .500 record.  
If  they are going to get by in this close division, they'll have to make some moves to strengthen themselves in this area.

Don't look for too many changes to be made. This is still a very good ball club and it's all about Jack McKeon getting his guys to get it together.  

Everyone counted us out in 2003 at the All Star Break and no one picked us to win our first title in 1997.  This is a team founded on proving analysts wrong and striving in the underdog position. Why else would we win both of our championships as Wild Card teams?  

I still believe this is the best roster in Marlins history.  It is a great mix of young and experienced players and it is lead by a great coach that has a knack for getting players in sync.  

The second half of the season should prove to be interesting as things heat up in the division. Look for the Marlins' talent to finally be displayed consistently.

Headline: Professor's work displayed in encyclopedia
Author: Karen Buitrago / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The "Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora," set for release in 2006, is a two volume work containing original documentation, cultural expression, theory and concept of the African dispersion throughout the world. 

According to Carole Boyce-Davies, general editor of the project and Director of African-New World Studies at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the main goal of the encyclopedia is to enrich the knowledge of students and the general public.

 "It puts the knowledge that exists in dispersed ways into some coherence," Boyce-Davies said. 

According to Boyce-Davies, the encyclopedia can stimulate knowledge exchange between different people.

"We don't know enough about each other. Knowledge [can create] a sense of commonality and act as a unifying factor," Boyce-Davies said.
ABC-CLIO Company and Oxford, a publisher based in England, contacted Boyce-Davies for the development of the encyclopedia. 

She admits that at first, she was concerned about being involved in the project because of the amount of work and detail it requires. 

The experience of the publisher inputting together other encyclopedias was the foundation for this project, which has been in the works for three years and is now entering its last phase of research, editing and submission.  Boyce-Davies will be honored with writing the introduction of the encyclopedia.  

"The project has moved quite fast because of the experience of the publisher. If you drag [a project like this], it can take 10 years,"  she said.  

Currently, there are few other universities involved in the making of encyclopedias. Harvard University published a multimedia encyclopedia called "Encarta Africana," put together by their Afro-American studies department. 

"It is not as global in scope as is ours, so it is not an Encyclopedia of the African diaspora. Ours will be the first and only one of its kind," Boyce-Davies said. 

The idea of dispersion started with the scattering of the Jewish people to different areas of the world. 

According to Boyce-Davies, African Diaspora dates back to slavery. 
Some entries for the encyclopedia contain works from history, art and science scholars. Graduate and undergraduate students with a good understanding of their topics have also submitted entries.

Sabrina Collins, the  encyclopedia's editorial assistant, will be submitting an essay on Orisa,  deities found in the Yoruba  religion. 

"Look outside your comfort zone. There is a whole beautiful world out there that so many of us miss because of  complacency," Collins said. "We definitely need more projects such as this. As broad and  incredible as this project is there is so much that we will miss." 

According to Boyce-Davies, 10 percent from the earnings of the encyclopedia will be used to create a scholarship fund. It is unknown at this point how much this effort is costing the publisher. 

"Royalties received from sales of the encyclopedia will go to establishing a scholarship fund for African-New World Studies graduate students to help them attend conferences and present their work to the intellectual communities," Boyce-Davies said.

Headline: Spielberg thrills with true-to-roots action in War of the Worlds
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
Steven Spielberg did it again. This time he returned to his roots with an action thriller turned horror flick - slightly reminiscent of Spielberg's "Jaws" and "Jurassic Park." 

"War of the Worlds," starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, takes you into a world where humans run from total annihilation and aliens use planet Earth as a testing ground. 

The film opens with an ominous voice-over by Morgan Freeman, reading almost verbatim from the 1898 H.G. Wells novel, "War of the Worlds," which inspired the 1938 Orson Welles radio broadcast that scared the country half to death. 

Moviegoers are introduced to Ray (Cruise), a divorced dockworker with weekend custody of his two children, 10-year-old Rachel (Fanning) and rebellious teenager Robbie (Justin Chatwin). 

This weekend visit is different, and it's no wonder why. After all, it begins with a lightning storm that will change their lives forever.

As a family, they end up running from giant metal machines operated by aliens dead set on destroying the planet and everyone on it. The three-legged war machines show no mercy while they incinerate everything in site.

But Ray has a different goal in mind: to live and make sure his family does too. 

Set in New Jersey, the scenes of destruction and death are strikingly similar to an even scarier real-life scene from nearly four years ago. Some film critics say this is Spielberg's direct theatrical response to the terror attacks of September 11. 

In fact, after Ray steals a minivan to get away from the aliens, Rachel and Robbie nervously ask him several times, "Is it the terrorists?"
Meanwhile, the special effects make the film a perfect summer blockbuster. Editor Michael Kahn takes the video by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski to another level. The editing is so effective that it sometimes needs no music at all to add drama. Still, Spielberg went to world-renowned composer John Williams for the musical score. 

Cruise's performance is nothing less than spectacular, and his chemistry with the other characters is priceless. 

Recently, Cruise has received plenty of criticism from the public and the media - putting him on front pages everywhere with his sanity in question. But the headlines didn't seem to hurt the overall box office performance in the film's mid-week debut. 

The film made nearly $35 million worldwide in just one day. Paramount Pictures announced last week that it was the largest opening day in their studio's history. That may not come as a surprise to Spielberg fans. 
Besides, anyone can see this film screams the essence of pure Hollywood drama. In fact, the film ends with a typical Spielberg ending - one that reaches straight to the heart and reminds the viewer that Spielberg will always be Spielberg.

Of course, some moviegoers don't understand the ending. But the meaning of the film's ending can't be any simpler and it helps the viewer understand a less clear point earlier in the film.

While the film was definitely worth a late-night viewing, one question comes to mind: Would E.T. approve of how the film portrays his kind? I think not.

Headline: Backstreet Boys return with long-awaited fifth album
Author: Raynel Kinchen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After five long years, the boys are finally back! The much anticipated new album Never Gone from Backstreet Boys' Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, A.J. McLean, Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson, fail to dissappoint fans. 

After all these years, many critics were questioning the group's longevity and their ability to maintain a fan base after such a long absence from the music scene. However, the numbers are in. The band peaked at number three on the Billboard charts, with Never Gone selling 290,946 albums in the first week alone. It seems like The Backstreet Boys are having a very welcoming homecoming. 

Never Gone is filled with rock and pop ballads and mid-tempo tracks that veer away from their original sound of R'n'B, pop classics and love songs. 

However, if you are still in search of the next "I Want It That Way," they do not disappoint. Many of the songs are in the same vein of serious lyrics and memorable melodies. In fact, the band features many introspective songs: "Lose It All," "Siberia," the title track "Never Gone," and "Weird World." These will meet the needs of the deepest thinker. 

 The songs that they have the most fun with are the heavily-harmonized "Poster Girl," the crazy mix of Motown and rock on "My Beautiful Woman," and the soaring "Climbing The Walls," which was rumored to have been slated for the "Spider Man 2" soundtrack.   

The guys also brought back their old producer/writer, Max Martin produced "Siberia," and the delicious rock/pop sing-a-long "Just Want You To Know." 

They also worked with many new writers like Five For Fighting, aka John Ondrasik, on "Weird World." "Never Gone," written by Kevin Richardson, Gary Baker and Steve Diamond, is a beautiful song dedicated to Kevin's father, Gerald, who died fighting cancer. 

It is a touching song about loss, and I found myself in tears listening to it because my own grandfather passed away this summer. On the other end of the spectrum is one of the most romantic songs on the album, "Safest Place To Hide" on which miraculously all five men get lead vocals. (Yes, even Kevin!) 

Never Gone is an album about emotion and thought. It is a testimony to BSB's ability to change with time and still stay true to their time-tested formula of quality music. It is a sound that has grown with the fans and can still be appreciated by the newer, younger audience. 

They may have taken a few years off; Brian to raise a child, A.J. to work on his sobriety (two and a half years sober), Howie to raise lupus awareness, Nick to grow as a solo artist, and Kevin in helping to save the environment and act in Broadway's Chicago. But, Backstreet's back and they are still making musical magic. It is almost like they were never gone.

Headline: Latin American films crack into mainstream
Author: Charlene Collazo / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
This summer two major Latin American films will hit the U.S. cinema at full blow with powerful issues: "Cronicas" and "Secuestro Express."  

During a discussion forum held in Fort Worth, Texas on June 17, the creators behind these two films expressed their concern to entertain and inform the general public of issues that affect Latin American's everyday.  The forum was sponsored by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. 

"Cronicas," produced by Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También") and Guillermo del Toro and directed by Sebastian Cordero, is the story of a Miami journalist named Manolo Bonilla (played by John Leguizamo), who is in search of a big story in Ecuador. He follows a serial killer nicknamed "Monster of Babahoyo."  By bending all journalism ethics, Bonilla hopes to unveil the killer's story to make his network famous, but doesn't realize that he's getting in too deep.  

"I have always been surprised by the stereotypical way in which a serial killer is portrayed," Cordero said at the forum. 

He came up with the idea for the film when he realized that not too many films stray away from that stereotypical killer portrayed on the big screen as an inhumane person that possesses no love for anyone.   
Cordero had been intrigued by Luis Alfredo Garavito, a 1999 killer in Colombia. His wife had no idea that Garavito was the type of man that would kill someone because he had always been a good husband and father. Cordero decided that his film would be based on the fact that serial killers are more to a story than just merciless beings.   

With its opening in Ecuador last September, Cordero also wanted to show his audience the violence and poverty that the country undergoes.  
John Leguizamo's role in "Cronicas" was his first Spanish performance on the big screen.  As one of the guest panels, he pointed out that he took on the role because he felt that Latin America possesses a powerful cinema.  He was born in Colombia and left when he was three years old. Doing this film was a way to show Latinos that they should embrace their Hispanic culture.  

"Things have changed.  Speedy Gonzalez use to be the only Latino image in entertainment and now there's hunger for more Latino actors," Leguizamo said at the forum.    

"Cronicas" will debut in New York and Los Angeles July 8 and will open nationwide July 22. 

In "Secuestro Express," the "express kidnappings" in Venezuela are told through the story of Carla (played by Mia Maestro) and Martin, a young upper-class couple who go out for a night of dancing and partying. 

Trece, Budu and Niga are three kidnappers who make a living staking out couples like Carla and Martin to make easy money by asking their rich parents for ransom.  Carla and Martin become their next target and are sent on a terrifying journey through Caracas while the kidnappers wait for Carla's father (played by Ruben Blades) to hand over a ransom of twenty-thousand dollars - equivalent to five years of the country's minimum wage.  

The story is told from the perspective of the couple and the kidnappers, since they are all victims of mass society. 

This idea can be seen in a clip from the movie in which Carla, the kidnapped victim, speaks with one of the kidnappers and asks him why they must do this to her after she gives her time to help out sick kids at a local hospital. 

The kidnapper responds by saying that she should have never been rich - driving expensive cars and wearing expensive clothes - when half of the country is rotting in poverty.    

"This movie entertains as well as send a social message about the deep problems of Venezuela," said director Jonathan Jakubowicz. 

Approximately every 60 minutes, a person is abducted in Latin America.  Seventy-percent of these victims don't survive.  

"Secuestro Express" will open in theatres on August 5.  

Latino actors and Spanish cinema are definitely making a big impact on the American film industry. Latinos have the biggest purchasing power in the United States. Spanish scripts will take over the English big screen with powerful issues that happen everyday in Latin America.

"We have to put our issues first before saying how beautiful Venezuela is," Jackubowicz said.

1. Caramel Apple Empanadas
Those savory, melt-in-your-mouth delicacies found at America's own "South of the Border" fast food hub - Taco Bell. Stuffed with a heavenly combination of apple chunks and caramel, these empanadas are to die for!

2. Miniature Schnauzers
There is nothing quite as adorable as the look of pure excitement on my mini schnauzer's face as she runs to the door to greet me each day. Bustling with energy and friendly to all, these little canines can just melt your heart!

3. Sailor Moon
 I can still remember trading cards with my fellow fanatics during recess, going on eBay to buy posters and action figures and rushing home after school everyday to watch these five Japanese heroines "fighting evil by moonlight; winning love by daylight."

4. Third Eye Blind
    Many of us associate this mid-90s band with their catchy "do do do"s and creative chords, but for me, Third Eye Blind is a lot more than just a faded rock group. Straying away from their more conservative and upbeat "pop" rivals, 3EB songs touch upon real issues like sex, addictions and death.

5. Dots
 We've all seen them - those gummy candies that got tossed into our good bags every Halloween. Instead of getting the more popular Blowpops and Snicker bars, the majority of kids were busy grieving over the excess supply of DOTS. I was busy establishing what would be a life time connection with these chewy culinary delights.

Headline: Beloved sixties sitcom better than ever on silver screen
Author: Elena Bellon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you're a sucker for magic and laughs, "Bewitched" may be the release you've been searching for this summer. 

Starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, this team of quirky, misunderstood characters find themselves in dire need of a "wake-up call." Both feel they've received the short end of the stick in life, and their journey is a chance for new beginnings and happy endings.  

Ferrell's character, Jack Wyatt, has miserable luck while still exuding a pretentious air. The mistakes of his past do not humble him nor make him a stronger individual, but rather make his entire persona one of a ridiculous nature, which in effect, makes for hysterical situations. 

Hardly being taken seriously in his profession by neither his coworkers nor the general public, Wyatt decides to remake the 60s hit TV show "Bewitched" with a slightly modern twist. 

He wishes to cast a "no-name" actress for the part of Samantha and thus stumbles upon the new-to-the-neighborhood Isabel (Kidman) who happens to have a knack for wiggling her nose (as did the Samantha in the original show). 

Isabel, in her desperation to lead a normal "trick-free" life, accepts the role of a normal human being, while quickly realizing fitting-in is tougher than it looks. 

The two find themselves in frustrating circumstances when Wyatt's intentions go awry and Isabel's "ideals" are not as simple as she once thought them to be.  

Although the film's plot is not the deepest of notions, its innocent and sweet nature does not, and should not, go unappreciated. It is a refreshing movie to sit back and enjoy. 

Ferrell and Kidman do a remarkable job of stepping outside of themselves (as good actors should do) in an effort to make you laugh as well as think. 

In many ways this movie mirrors real life. Its message is clear: be careful what you wish for, be careful not to assume, and most importantly; avoid attempting total inner-reformation and thus squandering your time searching for new identities as this may leave you in a place worse off than where you started.

With its cast of interesting and dynamic characters, "Bewitched" offers a small yet important reminder to dream the impossible while still saving your uniqueness.

Headline: Heating things up poolside
Author: Raquel Cool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
School is out, the temperature has risen and fun in the sun is to be had. Whoever you are, there are no excuses - you should be lazily afloat a tacky inner tube in the middle of the pool. In fact, invite your friends over for a pool party! Using this easy-to-do guide, a summer get-together will only cost you a few dollars.

The Potluck Method

You have probably heard of potluck gatherings from PTA meetings or church luncheons, but this method can make any occasion affordable. When everyone brings a little something to the table, the host is relieved of the burden of the cost and everyone gets a lot back for what they put in. When planning ahead, ask for the right things from the right people. Get reliable friends to bring important ingredients. Remember to ask that friend who is always running late to bring dessert.

The Gimmick

Now that you have learned how to deal with the food situation, you can deal with what all good hosts worry about - throwing a decent get-together. Beer and potato chips will only take you so far. Besides, you do not have to rely on letting the drinks set in to appease your guests. Instead, try providing them with a gimmick!  

In this case, fill the entire pool with as many water balloons as possible. Whether your pool party takes place during the day or at night, the water balloons are a fun accent to almost any summer occasion. Water balloons can be found cheaply at dollar stores. Be weary of rip offs; a good deal should go for about 150-200 balloons for every dollar you spend. I recently bought a thousand for five dollars at 99 Cents Stuff. While you are there, spend a dollar or two on water wings or animal shaped inner tubes.

The Drunken Melon

If you are planning a more low-key gathering, this classic watermelon treat might be for you. It's a melon that is saturated with vodka.  It takes a few days to prepare, but the idea is simple: cut a hole on the top of the watermelon and insert a funnel. Gradually pour a bottle of vodka in it over the course of a few days. Keep refrigerated. The fruit will absorb the alcohol. Once it's ready, slice it up and serve.

Do-it-yourself Smoothie Bar

Remember the potluck method? It could be perfectly applied to your very own pool-side smoothies if you get everyone to bring some fruit. Set up a blender, a juicer and a cooler full of fruit. Some smoothie recipes include yogurt, honey or ice. People can serve themselves their own smoothies whenever they like.

If you decide to juice the fruit yourself, do not discard the pulp. Hold on to leftover cantaloupe skin and banana peels to experiment with making low grade smoothies. Or you can also mold the pulp into sculptures. Whatever you end up doing, use your imagination.

Dear Editor, 

I was appalled to learn that a reporter from the Miami New Times seems to know more about what is hapenning at our school than its own newspaper writers.  

In a recent article titled "Newsroom or Classroom," Edmund Newton details the many problems weakening the infrastructure of the SJMC, including the ongoing resignation of valuable professors.

FIU's SJMC, which has earned several Pulitzer Prizes in the past, as you must know, is caving in. 

The Beacon should serve the students, go after the truth and report it.  Searching through the archives, I found very little has been written about these issues and what I did find only graces the surface of deeper conflicts.

I hope this letter serves to draw your attention toward meaningful reporting.

Headline: Fantasies prove problematic for Jackson
Author: Leonor Guerrera / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Now that Michael Jackson has been found "not guilty" on child molestation charges, we can talk about other important issues surrounding Mr. Jackson. Some of these issues are: how completely out of tune with reality he is, how parents could let their children go over to a loons home and how fantasies are becoming too big a  part of children's lives. 

The most surprising thing I found throughout the trial was that so many parents allowed their children to come in contact with Jackson, an adult who obviously leads an eccentric life and has ideas that might not be  appropriate for children. What in the world would make parents think it is a good idea for their child to go to Neverland ranch?

As for the molestation charges, no one has any doubt that he did in fact do something with the children in question. If Jackson wants to get funky with other adults, that is his business. If he wants to mess with anyone under 18, then I'm sorry to say ladies and gentleman, we have a problem; especially if someone like Jackson, who looks deranged and all together unwell, gets away with charges like the ones he faced. 

I have never been to California, so I do not know if people there are used to celebrities acting strange and therefore, the parents thought that Jackson's strange behavior was just part of the usual weirdness they have grown to expect from Hollywood. I know that if my child asked me to sleep in Jackson's home I would say, "Absolutely not. The way he treats children is insane." Take his children for instance: he makes them wear veils. I think that is creepy, not to mention that its going to give those poor children a complex.

This raises the question: What is normal? The way I see it, normal behavior is like a small oasis in a huge universe. Once you walk away from it, like Jackson has, the possibilities for weird behavior are almost infinite.  This means new rules about what is right and what is wrong.  Yet, who is to determine these rules?  The solution to the problem may be to examine the nature of reality and how it is presented to children.

It could also be a problem of how children are being raised these days. I see a major difference between the way I was raised and the way parents are raising their children today. It seems that many parents today go from one extreme to another. They either neglect their children and let them do whatever they want or they go in the opposite direction and discipline them in a kind of brutal way.  

Children should be raised in a flexible environment, but parents need to be concerned about who and what influences them.  There are parents who work hard to change the kind of ideas that movies and television put in children's heads.  

Fantasy-fiction has been a target of some parental groups, whether because of religious reasons or because of the violence and sex that goes with it. The media and Hollywood make billions of dollars by selling fantasies to the public and children. 

 The video games, toys, action figures, TV series, movies, cd's and dvd's all push the sale of fantasies. During his music career, Jackson was made into a glamorous icon and his image was sold to the masses, particularly to children. 

Take his album Thriller, for example. The song, "Thriller," from that album portrayed him as a werewolf in the video. What can be more fantastical than that?

This "fantasy" idea, however, has gone a bit far with Jackson. For starters, he lives in Neverland ranch, a place that was named after a mythical place where one never grows old.  There, he has created a child-like world with an amusement park atmosphere specifically for children. One might say that it is no big deal or that Walt Disney did something similar in creating Disneyland, however Disney never asked little boys to sleep in his bed. 

So we must ask, "Can people who live in a fantasy world be as dangerous as those who live outside the law?  Should we be suspicious of all fantasy fans-  Trekkies, "Star Wars," "Lord of the Rings," "The Matrix" and "Harry Potter" fans?  

Is refusal to accept reality a symptom of something else?  Should I worry because I like to watch Teletubbies?" As one can see, this raises many questions, but I think the most important of all of them is one we must ask of ourselves and of society. How much fantasy should we allow into the lives of children and how safe is it? The solution is a simple one. Children need fantasy in their lives, but parents should supervise the type of fantasy they get and who provides it. 

 The problem with Jackson is that he wants to share his fantasies with children, even though they are truly unhealthy and unsafe. 

Since we do not have rules about fantasies, or "fantasy police," it is up to parents to set them and enforce them, something I see happening less and less these days.Yet after all this,  Jackson's problem is one of the age-old questions of nature vs. nurture. Do we blame Jackson for his weird behavior, or do we blame his unstable upbringing? Perhaps his mom read him "Peter Pan" one too many times and he is truly living in his own little, "Neverland." 

     Jackson now joins a number of former child celebrities who have had problems with the law, problems dealing with reality and problems keeping their lives together as adults. They feel satisfied living in their own little made-up worlds. One can only hope that one day they can rejoin us in the real world.

Headline: University tuition to increase by 5 percent
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
Thousands of FIU students will be reaching deeper into their pockets as state officials announced an increase in tuition by some 5 percent this fall.

Beginning next semester, Florida residents at FIU will pay $102.08 per credit hour - combining $71.57 for tuition and $30.51 for additional fees. Full-time students taking 12 credits can expect to pay more than $1,300 per semester. Ten years ago, full-time students paid less than $700 per semester.

President Modesto Maidique told The Miami Herald that the increase is necessary because the school budget does not cover all of the university's costs. Without the increase, the university may have to rely on out-of-state and international students who pay a much higher tuition than state residents.

"We're looking to every possible source of revenue to be able to fund the needs of the university,'' Maidique told The Miami Herald.

But that concerns some students.

"They've been increasing the tuition for so long and if they continue on, I don't think it will feel like a public school, it will feel like a private university," said  junior Jerzy Brodzikowski. 

Incoming freshman Ashley Capo agrees.

"Tuition increases are ridiculous. I know some students that chose FIU because of a cheaper tuition. Sooner or later, what will be the difference between us and the University of Miami?" Capo said.

However, more money may mean more scholarships, and the state is making that clear. The state legislature will require all of Florida's 11 public universities to contribute 20 percent of the new money from the tuition hike toward financial aid.

FIU isn't the only school increasing its tuition. In Boca Raton, on the heels of a multimillion-dollar debt in its sports program, Florida Atlantic University is reportedly raising athletic fees by 17 percent, from $11.75 per credit hour to $13.75.

Student leaders at FAU complained to the Board of Trustees, which approved the increase, saying the tuition hike would not be beneficial for smaller branches of the school where there is little to no presence of an athletic program.

FIU made a similar move last year, raising the athletic fee by $1.38. According to the budget released last March, students will pay 73 percent of the costs of the sports program - about $10 million of the school's $13.8 million athletic budget.

Meanwhile, the national average of tuition for public universities is still higher than tuition at most of Florida's state schools. While most FIU and FAU students will pay about $2,700 per year, the national average may go well over $5,000 next year. 

State legislators said the 5 percent increase in tuition will affect all of Florida's public universities.

Headline: College of Engineering and School of Computer Science merge
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The FIU College of Engineering and the School of Computer Sciences merged into a new program July 1 after a year-long process of deliberation and preparation between the respective schools, administrators and the Faculty Senate.

"We have been having discussions about a merger since the early 1990s. Serious discussions actually started June 2004," said Provost Mark Rosenberg. "It might have taken place earlier, except there was prolonged discussion and we wanted to make sure that all viewpoints could be expressed."

Through this merging, the College of Engineering  now becomes the College of Engineering and Computing with Vish Prasad as its executive dean. The SCS will fall under this college as the School of Computing and Information Sciences and will be headed by Dean Yi Deng.

The school was formerly situated under the College of Arts and Sciences where, according to SCS Associate Director Masoud Milani, it maintained an independent budget and "faculty lines gathered directly from the Office of the Provost."

"We had good relations with [the College of] Arts and Sciences, but there were also cultural differences," Milani said. "There, it is supposed to be more collegiate, more academic and we are a department that deals with technical matters. We needed a college that could deal with those functions."

An SCS faculty assembly resolution compiled by Deng was presented to the College of Arts and Sciences in April and June with a list of reasons for the merger. 

The resolution states that, though investments are being made by other universities in the computing, information and communication fields, the "budgetary reality at FIU makes it unlikely for the university to afford major and sustained investments ... in these areas."

Rosenberg stated that greater funds and savings would be generated through the union of the programs by eliminating duplicate technology courses taught in both the CE and SCS and by combining computer platforms both share in common.

However, an estimate of how much money will save the initiative has not been reached yet.

"This merging is of great importance to FIU since we will now be able to provide a one-stop shop of computer research to the entire university, something that has been lacking here," said Jai Navlakha, temporary director for the SCS while Deng is out of the country.

The curriculum for students already enrolled in the programs and for those entering in the Fall term will not be altered because the transition is expected to take at least one more year.

Once the merging is complete, students will adhere to new curriculum structured around the current requirements of the College of Engineering.

Tenure for SCS faculty will be transferred to the new program. The tenure and promotion process for the 2005-2006 school year will reportedly follow procedures already in place.

Although no changes in the physical location of the programs have yet been established, the deans are making preparations for a possible move in the future.

Rosenberg also states that there may be "opportunities" for the merging of other schools, though "nothing is definite at this point."

Headline: Spotlight on Career Services
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Tucked away on the second floor of the Graham Center, the Career Services office goes unnoticed by most students. With its career-focused programs and well-informed counselors, the Career Services Center can be the key to a student's future.

"I'm proud to say that the Career Services office is one of the only offices on campus that students can continue to use after they graduate up until they retire," said Olga Magnusen, director of Career Services Program.

The counselors at the Career Services office use various tools to help students decide their majors, choose an internship, build their reference list, and even get a part-time job.

"I would say in a year, we service 15,000 students," Magnusen said. "We help them make an informed decision when choosing a major."

The Career Services Center does more than just help students choose their majors. The center plans several job fairs each year and hosts a number of workshops from "Resume Writing" to "Dressing for Success."
"We have a popular workshop called "Business Dinner Etiquette" that includes a six-course meal and a consultant to show students what proper etiquette is," Magnusen said.

Technological advances also help the Career Services Center bring together students and employers. The Cyber Café houses many computers where students can type their resumes or search for jobs online. 
The media room has video conferencing technology to allow students to conduct interviews with interested employers overseas.

Students submitting their resumes to career services may even get hired to work there. That's what happened to accounting major Vanessa Coronado.

"They are flexible and  understand I'm a student," Coronado said. "It's easier for me because I'm taking classes here."

"The summer is a little slower around here," said Jeniffer Vasquez, an employee of two years at the Career Services Center. "But sometimes during orientation, parents bring their children in, telling them to get a job."

Counselors and students, like Vasquez, make presentations during orientation and First Year Experience classes to encourage students to take the next step toward their future.

"It's nice to know students are interested in their future," Vasquez said. "After a while, students recognize me. They ask me questions in the hall or during lunch." 

With the rising success of the Career Services Center, the organization quickly joined forces with Delta Epsilon Iota, a co-ed fraternity that has gained over 400 members since its May 2005 induction ceremony, to focus more on career training and the needs of the modern day student. 
Students are not the only ones who can benefit from this service. The Career Services Center also lends help to FIU alumni.

"We can help alumni who have been laid off," Magnusen said.

Later this fall, the center is planning to expand into the surrounding floors, prompting it to be a major focus in the Graham Center.    

Students who want to take advantage of these services at the Career Services Center can join for a $20 lifetime fee.
