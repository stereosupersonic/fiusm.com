Headline: Commentary: FIU hits big with pre-game slumber party
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On what turned to be the final day of the Major League baseball season, FIU hit a homerun. 

The Athletic Department decided to host an-all night event at the stadium in order to promote attendance before the Panthers took on Holy Cross at 10 a.m. Saturday.

The slumber party, which began at 11 p.m. Friday, provided the students with a reason to stay out at night and not have to worry about waking up early to attend the game. While, the rain, present at times throughout the night, drove some students away, the idea was still a huge hit.

Well, maybe not quite a homerun come to think of it. I'd say more like a deep drive to the warning track. But hold on...who's that?

IT'S JEFFREY MAIER!!

The same kid, now 19 years old that pulled Derek Jeter's line drive over the fence in 1996 against Baltimore in the MLB Playoffs, made this one a round-tripper - barely. 

It scraped paint off the back of the wall. It was one of those that hug the foul pole and escape out of sight, just inches over the outfielder's glove.

There were plenty of reasons for people not to attend this event, even though it was a party, something that college students enjoy, last time I checked. 

But seriously, think about this for a minute: staying up all night, during on-and-off rain, in a stadium just to watch your 0-7 football team? Maybe it would work anywhere else in the country where there is nothing else to do, but not in South Florida.

 Miami? Where fair-weather fans rain supreme (no pun intended)? Think about it for a second. FIU got students to stay out all night for something that actually builds tradition and support for their university. 

For once people showed up and the university and Athletic Director Rick Mello have to be commended. They didn't just run with the spiel about how this is your school and this is how you build tradition. No. They were very involved. Mello threw the freakin' brick at each one of their feet and basically said, "Start building!" 

This deserves great admiration, especially with a student body like this one - where things are not certain and school spirit is sometimes lower than the stock market in the depression. FIU upped the ante - shoved all their chips to the center of the table - and had a let's-go-do-this-attitude about them.

I know some people were dragged off with the passing showers in the early morning, but to get approximately 1,000 students to show is something this writer thought never would be possible. 

Especially after seeing attendance at football games for almost two years. The greeks are responding and starting to grasp the concept. Others are attending sporadically. But 1,000 students go to a slumber party?

Someone is starting to understand something, here. The administration figured something out. The students bought into it. And FIU is one step closer to steamrolling any stereotypes that may have been thrust upon them earlier this year.

Hey, this isn't quite "Gator Growl" yet, but you know, it takes time. 

"That is what we have to do," said an enthusiastic Mello as time wound down and FIU preserved a 34-23 win over Holy Cross. "We have to build this thing, brick-by-brick."

The idea of a slumber party might sound like a reach at first. Even I doubted it. As "Radio" (give Cuba Gooding Jr. the Oscar right now!) let out, I drove by campus to find students in a craze. Was the fair in town?

That is what it seemed like. Either that or they were giving the stadium away. 

After five minutes of trying to get from one side of the end zone to the other in my car, I went to visit a friend that lives nearby. 

Trying to buy some time. Waiting to see what would happen in say, two hours, when it would be close to 3 a.m. 

Waiting for a pretty violent shower to pass, I was FIU-bound before calling it a night. On the approach, I thought: "People have to be gone by now; look at the rain that just came down. C'mon, this has to be empty."

The only one thing though: Tamiami Park and the parking lot were flooded. 

Most everyone that was there prior to the rain was still there. Like Casey Luaces, a junior architecture major that had to report for work at nine that morning. You're thinking no big deal, right?

Yes! Very big deal. This is an FIU-commuter-capital-of-the-universe student. The same student who you ask to have lunch with and responds, "I have to go to work, home, anywhere but here," line. 

Not staying for the game, why bother staying up all night?

"It wasn't your most-traditional college event...Not every student has a chance to go on the field and throw the football around on your home team's turf," said Luaces, a member of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. 

Added Melissa Marinelli, a transfer student from FSU: "I really don't remember anything at FSU getting this kind of turnout. Pow Wow is the homecoming event over there but it's not as popular as Gator Growl, so a lot of people don't really care for it. This can be a great start for FIU and start of a new tradition."

Tradition? Yes, tradition. People were roasting pigs in the parking lot. Being of Cuban decent, and judging from FIU's large Hispanic population, it cannot possibly get anymore traditional than that.

Pork in the wee hours and pancakes in the morning, can't go wrong there. Mix in music, movies and games and it is a good change from the typical Friday night outing and it is going to cost you considerably less.

While some left either after the rain or following breakfast, many stayed for the game. And glancing out from the press box, I noticed some nuts painted in blue. 

How you stay in the parking lot all night and then paint yourself blue for a football game at 10 a.m. is beside me. But, what is college for?

So, for those of you that toughed it out, Mello and brain trust: kudos. Those of you that left after eating some free food and had no good reason for taking off other than just leaving after you ate free food...hope you tripped over one of those bricks Mello has been laying.

Headline: FIU kicks off basketball season with Moonlight Madness
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The season officially began for both the women's and men's basketball teams on Oct. 20.

The day was special for both teams, who celebrated together among roughly 1,000 fans in the yearly pep rally celebration, Moonlight Madness.

Moonlight Madness marked the first day both teams could begin practicing under NCAA rules. It kicked off the homecoming week as sororities, fraternities and both current students and FIU alumni paid tribute to the Golden Panther basketball teams.

"The event was very exciting and lots of people came out to support the basketball teams and FIU athletics. The dancing and joining both dancers from the south and north campus were also really good," said junior Myriam Rogers, who is also on the volleyball team.

Coach Donnie Marsh and his team hope that this event will attract more fans to their games and he was encouraged by the turnout.

"The event was exciting and it provided a great atmosphere. If we could find that kind of energy in the arena when we play it would be great for us. If our kids come out to that kind of noise and excitement it would provide us with a lot of energy," said Marsh.

This year the event was a little different from last year because 

Marsh gave a speech and the players participated in warm-ups.

"This year I wanted to change it around from last year where we just came out and that's it. I wanted to show the crowd a sneak-peek on what they can expect when they come see our games," added Marsh. "I hope people will say, boy these guys will be exciting, let's put their games on our calendar."

The event featured performances by the BBC dancers and FIU cheerleaders. 

"There was a lot of hype and the event went really well. There were more people than last year," said Latoia Collier, member of the Golden Star Dance Squad from BCC campus.

"A lot of people came out here to show school spirit. I enjoyed watching all the other dance teams," said freshman Daniel Richards who is also part of the BCC Golden Star.

T-shirts, cups and beads were among the many giveaways given at the event by the Student Government Association and Panther Rage.

"Moonlight Madness was a complete success. It got the crowed hyped up and the energy was continuous throughout the night. The most exciting thing about the night was when they were giving giveaways and playing Stand Up by Ludacris," said SPC and Panther Rage member Angelica Fernandez.

And the students believe that more events like this can help FIU athletics.

"I loved everything about the event. There was a lot of spirit by giving away lots of free stuff. I think FIU has a great future ahead of itself," said junior Carlos Lang. 

For freshmen, this event introduced them to FIU's basketball teams and encouraged them to attend games this season.

"I have never been to a basketball game here at FIU but if its anything like this event, I will love them," said freshman Christine Guzman. "I enjoyed watching the players and hopefully I can support both the women and men teams."

"Both of the teams looked great and I hope they will have winning seasons. I will come out and support them and I hope people do the same," said freshman Mikel Urbistondo.

Many sororitiy girls were also eager to voice their support for their basketball teams.

"I loved the event it was great because it showed a lot of school spirit. I love that it supports our basketball players, who are wonderful," said Nancy Cadabit, who is part of Delta Phi Epsilon.

Moonlight Madness Committee Chairperson Nakeeta Jenkis was pleased with the outcome of the event and was glad it ended in a success.

"The event went really well and I think people really enjoyed themselves because many came up to me and told me they had a good time. People liked the number of giveaways we had this year and the presentations by the basketball teams, " said Jenkins.

Alumni students were also on hand as they seem to always come back to support FIU.

"The people were mad crazy. The performances were great from both the north campus and here [University Park]. Its always great when people come out in FIU spirit, it was a great night," said alumni Luanna Raman.

The host of the event was Panther Rage President Shaun Alcindor.

"I enjoyed the turn out of 1,000 people or so cheering FIU and this is what we want, people cheering for FIU sports. This is what we need at basketball games because when people show up cheering on the teams, they play a lot better," said a breathless Alcindor after hosting the entire event.

Headline: No. 10 men's soccer wins one of two, has unbeaten streak snapped
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Oct. 24- No. 10 FIU 1, Adelphi 0

Lately, the FIU men's soccer team has refused to lose.

Dating back to a Sept. 13 road contest against St. Louis, the No. 10 Golden Panthers had gone seven straight games without a loss. The streak extended to eight games as FIU, led by junior Fernando Plentz goal, knocked off Adelphi University 1-0 in overtime in Garden City, NY on Oct. 24.

Most of regulation time was spent with both teams exchanging unsuccessful attacks between the two penalty boxes. There were only four shots exchanged between the two teams in the first half. Things opened up in the second half, with both teams firing eight shots apiece, but neither team could convert. 

But it was senior goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg that kept FIU in the game, recording six saves without allowing a goal to record his second straight shutout and third on the season.

"Roy was able to make some good saves to keep us in the game," said head coach Karl Kremser.

However, like Bobby Boswell the week before, it was Plentz who played the role of hero in this game, taking a pass from teammate Oscar Gil from about six yards out and sending it to the back of the net in overtime to give FIU (9-2-2) the victory.

"Oscar sent a great through ball, and went down to end line, dribbled a couple players and made a real nice play sliding the ball into Plentz, who made a run to the near post. It was a great effort by both of those guys and it was a nice way to end it," Kremser said.

The goal was special for Plentz because he claims Kremser knew he was going to score in the game.

"Coach told me he had a feeling that I was going to score in this game, so he put me in. I was really happy that I could complete his expectation. So it felt really good, but I know I have to keep working hard and do my best everyday," Plentz said.

The win improved FIU's conference record to 2-0-1 and moved the team into first place in the Atlantic Soccer Conference. 

"This game was very important for us because Adelphi was 2-0 in the conference, so it was great to get the win. It was big time for us because we want to win the conference so we have [an automatic bid to the playoffs]," Plentz said.

It was also the fourth straight road game for the Golden Panthers, who are 3-0-1 on the current road trip. Adelphi fell to 8-5-2.

Oct. 25- No. 9 St. John's 3, No. 10 FIU 1

The 10th ranked Golden Panthers finally saw their eight-game unbeaten streak snapped with a 3-1 loss to No. 9 St. John's at Belson Stadium in Jamaica, NY on Oct. 25.

FIU (9-3-2) outshot St. John's 10-8, but suffered a few bad breaks and fell behind 3-0, making it hard for the Panthers to rally.

"St. John's is a very quick, fast, very high pressure team. I thought we played better than them in the first half and had some good chances. But they had a play before the half where they had a free kick from the side, near the corner, and the guy hit a nice cross and we didn't do a good job marking and they hit the ball in," said head coach Karl Kremser.

Kremser was referring to the Red Storm's first goal in the 29th minute, when Angel Rodriguez received a pass off a free kick from teammate Chris Wingert and directed the ball past FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg with a diving header.

St. John's (12-4-2) added to its lead early in the second half, when Ashley Kozicki was fouled in the penalty box, giving the Red Storm a penalty kick. 

Wingert took the shot and sent it to the lower far post past a diving Rosenberg to give St. John's a 2-0 lead.

However, the FIU defense believed there was no foul on the play.

"It looked bad because we had two defenders there, but it was fair play. The guy had no control of the ball whatsoever. He took a fall and then complained to the ref," said defender Zachary Peoples.

Things got worse for the Golden Panthers in the 62nd minute when the defense failed to clear the loose ball and the Red Storm's Chris Corcoran headed the ball past Rosenberg, making the score 3-0.

"On the third goal, we had just had a miscommunication in the back, and it wasn't until we were down 3-0, that we started to play the way we are capable of playing," Kremser said.

"We just beat up ourselves in the sense that they just countered off of all our mistakes. They were not a better team than us. We outplayed them, but every time we made a mistake, they countered off us," said Peoples.

Senior Johnny Pulido was able to get FIU its first goal in the 74th minute, when his penalty shot deflected off Red Storm goalkeeper Guy Hertz and found its way to the net, cutting the lead to 3-1.

But Hertz and the St. John's defense were able to hold off the Golden Panthers for the rest of the game to preserve the win.

"I was proud of how we played. We played some good soccer. I don't think the score was in any ways indicative of the game, and I think any other day we beat that team," Kremser said.

"It feels bad to lose this game because we know we're one of the big boys. It feels bad to know that we played a team we are better than and lost when we dominated the game. We see ourselves as a Final Four team, and know we should have won this game," Peoples said.

FIU next plays host to conference foe Philadelphia on Halloween night at University Park, then hosts Alabama A&M on Nov. 1.

Headline: Volleyball continues recent slide with two road losses
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Oct. 23- NMSU 3, FIU 0

FIU looked to avenge last season's straight set loss to New Mexico State, but failed to upset the Sun Belt Conference-leading Aggies, losing again in straight sets, 3-0, on Oct. 23 at the Pan American Center in Las Cruces, N.M.
Sarah Silagy (15 kills) led the way for the Aggies (20-4), with a match-high .560 hitting percentage. New Mexico State also had four players with double-digit digs. Morgan Reader led the charge with 11 digs to go along with her 38 assists.
"New Mexico State is a really good team. They are the best team in our league and I thought we played very well against them," said head volleyball coach Cookie Stevens.
The Golden Panthers were led by senior Julie Doan (15 kills). It marked the 14th time this season that Doan has recorded double-digit kills. Senior Jennifer Owens chipped in with five kills and eight blocks. 
But FIU was unable to capitalize on many of its opportunities.
"Right now, we're having problems with our outside hitting. We are very good in the middle, but we need to learn how to finish," Stevens said.
The win was the 14th straight for the Aggies, who own a comfortable first-place lead in the Sun Belt Conference West Division with a perfect 9-0 record in conference play.
The Golden Panthers, who started the season 10-5, have since lost five of their last six matches to fall to 11-10.
FIU is currently in fourth place in the Sun Belt East Division with a 3-5 conference mark, trailing Arkansas State, Western Kentucky and Arkansas Little-Rock. 

Oct. 25- Denver 3, FIU 2

The Golden Panthers' conference woes continued as the Golden Panthers fell to Denver, 3-2, at the Hamilton Gymnasium in Denver on Oct. 15.
The match was 2-2 entering the final set, but FIU was unable to convert its chances down the stretch, falling 15-11 in the final game.
"I thought we played well and we tried to close out the game, but we just couldn't do it," said senior Julie Doan, who had a team-season high .568 hitting percentage to go along with 22 kills.
Jennifer Owens recorded her second double-double of the season with 19 kills and a career-high 12 total blocks.
Betsy Moreland registered 53 assists, giving her 1,002 for the season, making her the third player in FIU history to eclipse the 1,000-assist mark in a season.
"We had amazing play by Jen [Owens], Julie [Doan], and Betsy [Moreland]. And Charlie [Ball-Llovera] had 19 digs and Liz [Baldwin] had 19 digs, so the girls played very well," Stevens said.
Ball-Llovera also chipped in with six block-assists.
FIU led the match 2-1 going into the fourth set, but couldn't finish off the Pioneers.
"We had opportunities to win the fourth game...we just need to learn how to finish. But we had a disappointing game [against New Mexico on Thursday], so it was nice to come out and play better tonight," Stevens said.
Said Owens on the loss: "We played really good tonight. We had a few errors now and then, but I don't really know what it was. I don't think we played bad at all though."
Despite the loss, the Golden Panthers still managed to outblock the Pioneers, the Sun Belt Conference's top blocking team (2.52/game), with a season-high 16 to Denver's four.
But Denver (15-9, 6-3 Sun Belt West) got a strong performance from Olympia Hughes, who recorded 19 kills, 12 digs and three total blocks. 
Denver was also led by Kelli Rudelson (16 kills), Lisa Hunter (14 kills, 14 digs) and Kristin Halt (14 kills, seven digs).
FIU (11-11, 3-6 Sun Belt East) lost for the sixth time in seven matches, and for the fifth time in its last six conference matches.
"We started off the season pretty well. And then comes the conference, and our conference is really good. The Sun Belt is getting a lot better, so it's been tough," said senior Jennifer Owens.
Added Doan: "Our conference is very strong and everybody is out to beat us all the time. FIU has a good reputation in conference play, so we have to play great every game to win. It's difficult to get everyone to play that good all the time when everybody is playing their best games against you."
The Golden Panthers return home for a four-game home stand, starting with a rematch against Western Kentucky on Nov. 1. FIU lost to the Hiltoppers, 3-0, on the road on Oct. 10.

&nbsp;
Dear Friends,
For the past two years, I've always heard horror stories having to do with the Financial Aid office here at FIU.  I've heard stories about students not getting their aid money until maybe half way through the semester.  Students not being able to enroll and having to pay their fees late.  I never chose to believe this.

This year, I guess, was my turn.  I was approved for a $1,500.00+ loan.  When I received an incomplete check from FIU, I went directly to the Financial Aid office in PC.  I was told that the loan was cancelled because it was supposidly too much for someone who was not living on campus.  The thing is, I live in Greek Housing, and the last time I checked, we're conveniently located right across the street from the President's office at the 107th Avenue entrance to FIU.  I told them this and they reinstated my loan.  Two days later I receive a second post card telling me that I need to take the Educaid loan course online AGAIN.  To avoid any problems, I did.  I know found out that FIU has two loan checks totaling more than $3,000.00.  

I've been in the Financial Aid office to discuss this matter with two individuals.  I'm still waiting for someone to apologize and recognize that they've made a mistake.  The last time I checked, I'm an FIU customer as are 33,000+ students in this university.  To this day, I still have not received that loan.  The only thing I have received has been horrible customer service and an offer to take out ANOTHER loan in the mean time to cover their mistake. 

I guess, the thing that really bothers me is the fact no one in that office has had the decency to say, "I'm sorry."  I would have happily seeked some temporary help through a short term loan from the University or from a friend, but just the fact that no one is taking responsibility really disturbs me.  

Sure, they will certainly say, "We serve thousands of students each semester, we can't get every single one right."  To that I say, "Get a system that works. Integrate your computers so that you have definate access to the information that effects our eligibility for financial aid."  

I am proud to be an FIU student.  The rate of growth that this University has undergone since I enrolled in 2001 has been incredible.  The professors of this university are generally worth every penny of our tuition, but there is always room for improvement.  Let's keep up guys!

Headline: Balkenbush, Molnar lead way for FIU swimming/diving team
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
It's only the second week of competition for FIU's inaugural swimming/diving team, but already two Golden Panthers are making a splash.

The tandem of sophomore diver Megan Balkenbush and freshman Viktoria Molnar were victorious in the 100-yard butterfly and 1-meter diving, respectively to lead FIU on the second day of the Sun Belt Fall Classic at the NMSU Swimming and Diving Complex in Las Cruces, N.M.

Balkenbush dominated the 1-meter dive competition, scoring 244.35 points to top all other competitors, and finished second in the three-meter, falling just 3.10 points shy of first.

Molnar finished first in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 59.68 and finished second in the 200-yard freestyle (1:57.92). Freshman Kate Van Houten finished the 200-yard freestyle in firth, with a time of 2:00.16.  Molnar also anchored the 400-yard medley relay, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish.

FIU also received stroing performances from junior Tiffany Hayes, who finished fourth in the 200-yard individual medley (2:15.37), Joyce Fuhrman, who tied for fifth in the 50-yard freestyle (26.15) and Carly Crandall, who finished seventh (26.36).

Headline: FIU 'Gor'es Holy Cross
Subheadline: RB Gorman's 187 yards, 3 TDs lead FIU
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Eventually, he knew they would have a breakout game. He knew they were frustrated after starting the season 0-7. The one thing he did not know, however, was whether or not he would ever get into the end zone on his longest run from scrimmage.

He did.

Running back Adam Gorman, filling in for starter Diamos Demerritt and backup Rashod Smith, scored on a 73-yard scamper down the right sideline to put FIU comfortably ahead with 9:37 to go in the fourth quarter. Gorman, who has played tailback on two other occasions this season, gained 187 yards on 23 carries (8.1 yards per carry) in FIU's 34-23 win over Holy Cross before 4,506 spectators on Oct. 25. 

The homecoming crowd withstood scattered showers and witnessed Gorman gain the second most yards of any FIU rusher in the school's brief history (Smith rushed for 262 against Jacksonville in 2002).

The St. Petersburg native's three touchdowns equaled Smith's school record - set last season against Butler. 

"I guess we were just ready to break out of our shells and it just happened," said Gorman, who missed most of the second and third quarter with minor injuries. "[The 73-yard run] was actually designed to go to the left side, and there was nothing there because they were slanting to our strong side. I cut back [to the right], broke one tackle and it was open field from there."

While Gorman's score put the Golden Panthers in the driver's seat, it was freshman linebacker Alexander Bostic's interception return for a touchdown that swung the momentum entirely in FIU's favor.

Bostic, a Miami native, took quarterback John O'Neill's pass 28 yards in a scintillating return. The 6-2, 216 pound true freshman shed the receiver on his back when he initially made the catch, then broke another tackle before emerging from three gangs of would-be-tacklers. 

Eventually, he carried another Crusader into the end zone. FIU led 27-20 after kicker Adam Moss failed to convert the extra point.

"I got three things accomplished today: My first interception, first touchdown and first win - that's the big thing about it," Bostic said. "I was just thinking of a game that me, [teammate] Antwan [Barnes] and my little brother Jonathan used to play in the yard called throw-up tackle. You got to fight to get into the end zone, so I just kept going left and right."

Coach Don Strock added: "Anytime the defense scores it is a big plus, I don't care what league you are in, Mighty Mice, Midget. He made a great play and it gets everybody and wakens them up a little bit."

 FIU (1-7), which has been scoring the bulk of its points late in games, accepted coach Strock's challenge and marched down the field in five plays on their first drive. The Golden Panthers capitalized on a 50-yard return on the game's opening kickoff by Greg Moss. Strock then went to his fill-in tailback, Gorman, on each play of the drive to take an early 7-0 lead on a two-yard run. 

Holy Cross evened the score at 7-7 when their big-play receiver Ari Confesor scored on a 42-yard pass from O'Neill. The sophomore quarterback completed all three of his passes for 57 yards on the Crusaders' opening drive.

"Defensively we didn't do anything in the first half," Strock said. "We ended up with a win. It was a big win for us but we obviously have a lot of work to do."

Gorman wasted no time getting back to work after his first score - plunging into the end zone from one-yard out to give FIU a 14-7 lead early in the second quarter. 

Quarterback Josh Padrick was instrumental in the Panthers' second scoring drive. First he avoided a sack deep in his backfield while in FIU territory. The redshirt freshman escaped from the grasp of a Holy Cross defender, scrambled to his right and found receiver Cory McKinney cutting across the middle for a 30-yard completion. 



Padrick, who completed 12-of-19 passes for 159 yards, hit Harold Leath for a 24-yard gain before taking a bootleg 12 yards down the one-yard line.

"When you hand off and they do a great job, it opens up the pass and makes it a lot easier to make the reads. I'm not saying I did the best reads," said Padrick through a slight chuckle. "I think there were three momentum turners, scoring on the first drive, Alex's just amazing-running-all-over-field-interception-for-a-touchdown, he must have run 100 yards just to go 20 and Adam's run."

The Crusaders, also a slow-starting team, came within one point of FIU, 14-13, after a missed extra point by Mike DeSantis followed a one-yard touchdown run by Gideon Akande in the second quarter.

Running back O.J. Price helped FIU expand its lead, 21-13, before halftime with a one-yard touchdown run. Price, who carried 4 times for 22 yards on the drive, entered the game after Gorman was nicked up on a short reception. 

Holy Cross (1-7) trimmed FIU's to 21-20 with an 18-play, 89-yard drive that took nearly nine minutes of the third quarter. A one-yard pass from O'Neill to tight end Edwards Lobb on fourth down capped the lengthy drive.

Bostic then got into the end zone with 27 seconds left in the third to put FIU ahead by a touchdown.

Holy Cross kicker Mike DeSantis added a 25-yard field goal before Gorman's third touchdown secured the win.

"I didn't expect [Gorman's performance], Strock said. "But I'll take it."

Headline: Editorial: Readership program isn't a good deal for students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
University Park students will be picking up issues of The New York Times, USA TODAY, and The Miami Herald, but - despite the advertising - they won't be doing so at "NO CHARGE." That's because, in reality, UP student government is paying $19,989 from student Activity and Services fees to have those papers delivered until next summer.

The papers, available at three spots at the UP campus - Graham Center, Green Library, Panther Hall - and also at the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences campus, are part of The Newspaper Readership Program, a program which participates at some 250 campuses nationwide.

According to Scott Brown, educational manager of the southeast division of The New York Times, the Time's "... goals are to stimulate critical thinking and promote life-long learning." That's in line with what Clayton Solomon, UP student government president, apparently felt this program would accomplish when he and his council spear-headed the effort to bring the program to FIU, likely with the best intentions. But that might have been naivete.

Readership programs, such as this one, have one thing in mind: increasing their circulation numbers by forcing subscriptions on people who often don't realize that their "complimentary" newspaper is actually costing them money.

The result is an increase in circulation figures for the publication, which translates to higher pay from advertisers looking to place ads in the contributing newspapers.

It might be argued that while the newspapers are looking to "get theirs," and it's only natural - they are businesses after all - students still stand to gain from the program,  owing to the greater accessibility of news, thereby justifying the expense.

But is the expenditure justified? Just 501 newspapers are delivered Monday through Friday - 167 from each participating publication. If that sounds like a lot, it isn't when you consider that the UP campus hosts about 27,000 students. That means, at best, just fewer than 2 percent of students will get their hands on one of the distributed papers. Many copies will wind up in a garbage can not far from the stand, with only the sports page missing.

If the intent of this program is to educate students, the numbers just don't add up: $19,989, for 501 newspapers a day, for 27,000 students.  It's unlikely that there will be much of a long-term effect.          This program looks good on the surface, but it isn't a wise use of student money; It's a bad deal.

Headline: Students plagued by identity theft, lose security on university campuses
Author: Silvio Laccetti / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Some students go to college to learn more about themselves, to discover their identities. Others go to college and create a new identity, making a break with their past. None could fairly be said to go to college in order to lose their identity, or worse yet, to have it stolen.

But our colleges and universities are the most fertile fields for the cultivation of identity theft, our nation's fastest-growing crime. 

Such theft occurs when someone else uses your name and other identification, almost invariably your social security number, to obtain fraudulently money, goods or services.

In its most horrendous form, identity theft becomes a major weapon for drug traffickers and terrorists. October's issue of Consumer Reports notes that an al-Qaida group in Spain opened bank accounts and paid for phones and travel with stolen identity information.

For the last decade I have watched a disturbing trend grow to menacing proportions. I have been strident in my warnings against it: social security numbers, especially for college students, were becoming universal identification numbers.

Developments in computer software were driving us toward that prophesied day when everyone would have a universal identifier, able to unlock every vital piece of information that should be private.

Students don't seem to care. Worse yet, they are largely oblivious to the dangers that can affect them for many years. The situation is outrageous.

Rutgers University uses Social Security numbers as ID. Students put Social Security numbers on tests for identification, on homework submission, and for attendance purposes. The University of Georgia uses it for ID, for registration and for the meals program. George Mason University in Virginia uses Social Security numbers for sports programs and fraternity membership.

Criminal charges were brought against a Boston College student for illegally obtaining the personal data of students and faculty. He began by hacking into computer hard drives of more than 100 students. This led to Social Security numbers and other private information of some 4,800 students and faculty.

In light of the reports, it is truly alarming to learn from a www.BankRate.com article that 48 percent of college students nationally have grades posted with Social Security numbers.

Fortunately, some schools have avoided or eliminated the problem: The University of Pennsylvania issues random-number IDs. Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Wash., just changed to random-number ID last year. At the University of Nebraska, students can have their number expunged from the system.

And what about Boston College? Today, it has a new random number system for student identification.

At my own institution, we were using Social Security numbers as an ID. This year, usage began to proliferate to other areas. I was extremely disturbed by this trend and, at our first faculty meeting this October, I proposed a motion that we immediately cease using Social Security numbers for exams. The measure passed.

We will have random-number IDs in the fall of 2004.

The potential for massive identity thefts on college campuses must be eliminated. I have written to all federal and state representatives expressing my concerns and I urge all interested citizens to write to theirs.

Success is possible. New York State's legislature passed a law restricting college Social Security number use in 2001; Washington state followed suit in 2002. Illinois, Arizona and Rhode Island have also taken action in the matter.

College students should seek change on campus immediately. Campus organizations and student newspapers should take up the cause. For these students, it is a matter of maintaining their good name and their personal identity.

Headline: Ducks had preferential treatment for too long
Author: Eduardo Rodriguez-Perez
&nbsp;
I consider myself a novice sportsman, and usually tip my hat to the way nature gets its job done. I've often found myself riding out through Biscayne Bay as the sun peeks over the eastern horizon, and have found fewer places as enjoyable. 

I religiously devour the monthly offerings of Florida Sportsman, and try to stay abreast of important ecological and socio-political issues related to boating and fishing.

I am not ignorant to the potential role a Muscovy duck population can play on our University Park campus, with its extensive system of water table-marking lakes and ponds. 

And I acknowledge the humane - if expensive and time consuming - treatment this institution has afforded said duck populations in the past. But the situation has degraded considerably. 

I can already hear the animal rights fanatics getting all riled up. But there's only so much festering duck excrement that I can take.

Thinking back I have several memories of a solitary, rebellious duck, waddling around the now defunct Blue Tables just north of Graham Center. It would begin its begging routine subtly, collecting what it could in the form of food, before strutting along on its merry way.

But now those tables have gone away to greener pastures, namely to the inconvenient hustle-and-bustle of the bookstore/parking lot quad. What we're left with now are the Grey Tables, sitting on the quiet, covered northern pavilion of the Green library. 

Those Grey Tables, surprisingly, have proven extremely comfortable and convenient. 

There are few places where student can sip coffee, and take a drag off a cigarette, all the while maintaining a wireless internet connection on a laptop computer. 

But what could've been a Mecca for outdoor lovers, smokers, and computer geeks alike, is now marred by a population of waterfowl, who innocently, are taking all they can get.

Sitting around long enough, you hear the jokes, and see the abuse. Just over a week ago, I overheard a cell phone conversation in which a student joked about calling some duck hunters. 

I'm not joking - I think we should. Open season on the northern library fields is what I'm about.

And what drives such a strong opinion? I'm tired of trying to walk into the library, while playing hopscotch around duck pies, which stain the entire northern outdoor corridor. I'm disgusted when a cute girl, who's trying to calmly and quietly enjoy a snack and coffee, is literally accosted by a swarm of over 10 ducks, biting and snapping at the brown paper bags from Java City. 

The ducks have learned, and oh-so quickly, that those magic bags usually contain a snack, if not a full-fledged lunch.

What happened to hygiene? I doubt a herd of feral cats, or a pack of stray dogs, defecating on the library steps would be tolerated. Why then does the flock of ducks get a free ride?

'Wait, aren't they protected?'

'Won't you get fined $500 bucks if you touch them?'

I wonder who's going to ante-up the $2.95 + tax when one of those miscreant pests snaps at my turkey and ham baguette.

I don't mind those ducks being protected, preserved, or even worshipped. What I do mind is trying to sit quietly outside, and consume a simple butter croissant, without being encircled by four or five ducks, all licking their beaks at the sight of the magical brown bag. And I detest having to tolerate the overwhelming amount of feces those ducks leave behind.

What is more displeasing to the eye than a beautiful modern library facility, whose entrance is littered by the waste of the encroaching behavior of some raggedy, miscolored ducks?

So go ahead, feed the ducks. Do as you please. Just remember, that as long as those ducks are not just tolerated, but accepted, you can't complain about the brown stains on your shoes, or bag, and you can't cry and moan when your lunch is swiped by a web-footed beast.

But in the end, you have to admire the resilience of these ducks, somewhat. In the battle between the students and the ducks, the ducks have adapted, and all but taken over. 

Maybe our fine book repository should be called the Steven and Dorthea Green Duck Reserve? 

Then it would all make sense.

Headline: Readership program profits from students
Author: Andy Diaz / Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
As I'm sure some of you have noticed, trichotomic newspaper racks have sprouted up around University Park campus under the false banner "Newspapers...at NO CHARGE," offering students copies of The New York Times, USA TODAY, and The Miami Herald ostensibly for their intellectual edification. 

The program is an extended version of a similar initiative started by the acting UP SGA in 2001 that tried to distribute The Miami Herald to students on Sunday. The former was more benign in the sense that it was never put into effect.

I was opposed to the first program because it was a useless self-serving sham that worked a lot better as a bulleted paragraph on the resume of the SGA representatives than it did in practice. The sequel is not any different.

Part deux of the initiative, plagued by inter-campus financial bickering as though its intrinsic problems weren't enough, will put out 501 papers, daily (167 copies of each publication) at the swell price of $19,989. 

It's not hard to notice the program's questionable benefits when we juxtapose the 501 copies against FIU's 34,000 students. If several news-hound students pick up a copy of each of the newspapers then the already limited beneficiaries of the program start to dwindle.

In an article on the subject appearing in this issue of The Beacon, UP Student Government Council President Clayton Solomon, who doesn't hesitate to take credit for the flawed program, is quoted as saying, "This is the time when students can see the fees they pay go directly back to them." I hate to lecture Clayton on basic arithmetic, but 501 copies only benefit 501 students, even though 34,000 students are paying for his laughable attempt at populism. 

The only students benefited would also be the ones taking morning classes since most of the limited newspapers are gone by noon. Students with part-time or full-time jobs who can only take afternoon or night classes will never see a copy of these papers.

This segues into the deplorable way in which the SGA is obfuscating the students in order to advance their initiative. 

The racks unapologetically boast "Newspapers will be available to you at NO CHARGE" which couldn't be further from the truth. 

The fact is, these newspapers are not free (one can only hope they were,) they're being paid for by money allotted from students' tuition. Prior to the start of the program, SGA conducted a survey of 300 students where they asked those surveyed if they would read newspapers that were offered to them at no cost. This is hardly the case. The student body is taking on the full financial burden of this program.

The survey also showed, according to Solomon, that "every student knows who the 'American Idol' winner is, but they don't know who their attorney general is." I'm not sure how a supposedly "free" newspaper available only to a negligible minority of FIU students will remedy that. Maybe if FIU had smaller class sizes and didn't allocate its money so haphazardly, its student body would be more knowledgeable of current events.

The newspapers involved are equally enthused. And why wouldn't they be? Every college that signs on to their ridiculous program adds a couple of hundred units to the readership amount they present their advertisers, and the price they charge these advertisers to promote their product on the paper. The representatives from these papers failed to mention this. Instead they said they wanted to "promote life-long learning" - whatever that means.

However, their commitment to the esoteric notion of "life-long learning" is questionable as well. It seems to me if that were the case, they would offer a lot more than 500 copies of their paper to every university in the country at absolutely no cost at all.

All the parties involved also failed to mention that students already have free - and I mean free in the old-fashioned, no financial cost sense of the word - access to the information in these newspapers since anyone with an internet connection can log on to their web sites - www.nytimes.com, www.usatoday.com, www.herald.com - and read the same articles that appear in the printed versions. This makes SGA's reasons all the more ridiculous.

The Newspaper Readership Program needs to be advertised on insidious terms because the last people it will benefit are the students. 

SGA representatives and newspaper publishers stand to gain endlessly more than students who essentially end up paying money for information that will not be available on the printed page to the large majority and that can be accessed at no cost by anyone in a computer lab.

Headline: Soaring college tuition stirs political debate
Author: By Robert Dodge/ The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
The cost of a college education, which has risen steadily for a decade, soared for the 2003-04 school year. And now, it is becoming a political issue.

A new report issued Tuesday showed that average tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose 14 percent, to $4,694. Similarly, costs at two-year public schools rose 13.8 percent, to $1,095.

And at private universities, where costs run higher, prices rose 6 percent, to $19,710.

The College Board, an association of colleges and universities that issued the report, blamed the economy and a shortfall of federal and state revenues. The group said many students have been protected from tuition hikes by the growing availability of financial aid.

Even so, the latest figures took on a political charge as Republicans accused colleges and universities of wasting taxpayer funds on lavish campus facilities. Among those cited were large hot tubs, sunbathing decks and massage facilities, as well as a rock-climbing wall at a recreation center at the University of Houston.

Elwyn Lee, vice president for student affairs at the University of Houston, objected to his school's 264,000-square-foot, $53 million recreation center being used as an example of college largesse. He said the facility was built at student request and is being financed with a $75-a-semester fee.

"There are no massage parlors. There are no pedicure places in our facility," Lee said. "Some people are speaking and letting their enthusiasm get away from them."

But Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said colleges and universities have not been held accountable for such spending.

"Hyperinflation in college costs has been pummeling parents and students for more than a decade, and the problem has not been a lack of spending by states or the federal government," he said. "The bigger issue is whether institutions are accountable enough to parents, students and taxpayers, and clearly they are not."

College Board officials said schools have taken steps to tighten their belts as the recession shrunk tax revenues. While they were reluctant to forecast future trends, they noted that college tuition and fees also had escalated during earlier recessions.

"It is a problem, (but) it is not an unprecedented problem," said Sandy Baum, an economics professor at Skidmore College, who wrote the board's annual "Trends in College Pricing."

In blaming the trend on tax revenue shortfalls, university officials tapped into Republican angst about being accused of under-funding public education in advance of next year's presidential election.

Democrats used the report to accuse Republicans of draining education coffers to pay for President Bush's tax cuts.

"Republican tax and budget cuts have hurt students by forcing states to raise tuition," said Rep. George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House education committee.

Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board, warned against initiatives that would limit the ability of institutions to freely set tuition and fees. But Boehner has praised a bill introduced by Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., that would allow the federal government to cut off federal subsidies to institutions that repeatedly impose "exorbitant" tuition increases.

Daniel Langan, an Education Department spokesman, said the Bush administration would take a serious look at McKeon's proposal. And he accused critics of using "inflammatory rhetoric," noting the administration's 2004 budget would boost funds for grants, loans and work-study opportunities by $2.8 billion.

The College Board report showed that during the last decade, tuition and fees rose 47 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis at four-year public universities and 22 percent at two-year public schools. Cost at private universities rose 42 percent.

Despite the increases, college officials said they are struggling.

"All of us need to focus on the mounting and troubling hardships of financing an education," said Caperton, who is a former Democratic governor of West Virginia. 

David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, said reduced earnings on endowments and fewer financial gifts by alumni and corporations also contributed to funding shortages.

"We are in the middle of a very difficult period in financing higher education," he said.

College Board officials said that a dip in room and board costs at both public and private schools helped moderate the tuition hikes.

They also said the effects of tuition and fee hikes were less burdensome on student pocketbooks because almost 60 percent of undergraduates receive financial aid. They said financial aid has been rising to further soften the blow.

Statistics for student aid are a year behind tuition and fees.

During the 2002-03 school year, total financial aid rose to $105 billion, up 14.5 percent over the previous year. And during the past decade, financial aid rose 203 percent, up from $34 billion in the 1992-93 academic year.

College Board officials said that financial aid left the "average student" well positioned to absorb increased costs. 

But they acknowledged that 40 percent of students receive no aid and have to shoulder the additional expense.

Headline: Sororities hold candy drive for local youth
Author: Erika Taveras/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Alpha Xi Delta and Alpha Omicron Pi chapters at FIU will be organizing a Halloween candy drive for children this year.  Both sororities will be collecting individually wrapped candy and money donations in the Graham Center from Oct. 28 until Oct. 30.

Once all the candy is collected, the sorority members will make little Halloween treat bags to  give to approxiametely 60 children at Guardian Sheperd Lutheran Christian Day School, a local, private elementary school, on Oct. 31. 

The sorority members also plan on engaging in all kinds of fun activities with the kids on the day of the visit. They will play with the children for about an hour at the school's playground.  

Greek organizations have a philanthropy, or cause they raise money for. Alpha Xi Delta has Choose Children, the philanthropic notion adopted by the Alpha Xi Delta sorority nationwide, which focuses on youth welfare. 

"People think that sororities are just an excuse to party, but my experiences with Greek life here at FIU have been different," said Adriana Pereira, vice president of Public Relations for Alpha Xi Delta.  "Philanthropy and service is a huge part of my sorority.  Almost every event we host is to raise money for Choose Children."  

The money that is collected will in part be used to finish buying any candy or supplies needed for the event, and the rest will goes towards their philanthropy. 

There is the misconception that Greeks do not get along or come together to host events like this one, according to Pereira. 

But she feels that the Halloween drive will serve as an example of the unity and participation amongst Greek organizations and FIU students in general.  

This is the first time that her sorority will hold an event like this, and they are hoping for a very successful outcome due to all the active members participating in the drive. The approximately 97 Alpha Xi Delta members this semester are looking forward to collaborating with members of Alpha Omicron Pi. 

"We are very happy to be working with Alpha Omicron Pi because they are a great group of ladies and although their sorority is very young on our campus, they have worked very hard during their time here at FIU and they have earned all of our respect," said Pereira.  She also stressed the importance of all FIU students donating for the drive, because the events they hold are not limited just to Greek societies. 

Though the other sorority participating in the candy drive, Alpha Omicron Pi, specifically supports adult and juvenile arthritis research as its philanthropy, Kenya Tom, the sorority's philanthropy chair said, "We care about everyone!"  

Tom thinks the candy drive is important not only because it is for a good cause, but also because it reinforces the concept of Greek unity.

 "This event is also a way to promote Greek unity because in the end we are all serving similar purposes in our communities," Tom said.  

 Karen Katz, assistant director of Campus Life and Greek Affairs, also places an emphasis on Greek unity.  She said that sororities and fraternities coming together to perform community service and philanthropic events like this one, greatly represent FIU and demonstrate the union of the various organizations.  In addition, she added that FIU has received various awards due to the great quality that Greeks and students possess when hosting all the different kinds of events.

For more information about the Halloween candy drive, contact Lismey Mitat, the Chapter Life vice president for Alpha Xi Delta at LismeyM@aol.com.  Or visit the websites of the participating sororities:  www.fiu.edu/~azd for Alpha Xi Delta and www.fiu.ed/~aoii for Alpha Omicron Pi.

Headline: New tutoring, mentorship program seeks FIU volunteers
Author: Carolina Sarassa
&nbsp;
Have you ever thought about making a difference in the life of a child? 

The Agape Family Life Center at FIU's College of Health and Urban Affairs is currently looking for students to become part of the tutoring and mentoring program it intends to offer at middle and high schools. 

Students interested in the program and with the time available could become a great help for one of these children. If the student's major is affiliated with the course of the subject tutored, there should be no problem participating in the program as a tutor, according to Daedre Henry, administrative assistant of the program and also a senior majoring in Health Services Administration.

"Even though these middle and high schools have professionally trained teachers to tutor students, our program is recruiting FIU students," said Henry. 

The Agape Family Life Center, which is based at the Biscayne Bay Campus, aims to help children develop a positive self-image, work well with others, and recognize their potential.

As such, this program is not only aimed at education. Students who volunteer as mentors will help provide recreational and cultural activities, such as dancing and basketball, for the children. 

The purpose of a mentor, said Henry, is to give the children support from someone outside their family. The mentors are like "big brothers." They become friends, advisors and try to serve as a good guide for these children and teenagers. 

The tutoring aspect of the program focuses on English and math.

Some compensation or negotiable salary might be offered to tutors, not mentors, for their services. It will depend on the tutor's experience and level of education. 

Affiliation with the program requires participation for a full academic year, with the current term ending in June 2004. This is a requirement due to the fact that it would not be beneficial for the child to all of a sudden change his tutor and have to adapt to someone else, according to Henry.

"As a psychology major, I believe tutoring teenagers will not only be beneficial to them, but to my career," said sophomore Elizabeth Regalado.

Once the student applies to the program and is accepted, he or she will need to go through an orientation.

"[It is] a regular orientation just like when you entered FIU," said Henry. 

These tutoring and mentoring activities will take place during after school hours at the Hialeah Institute and Van Kare Educational Center. The student should devote two to two-and-a-half-hours daily from Mondays through Thursdays. During the weekends, a maximum of 12 hours.  

Tutoring programs can be beneficial and efficient in helping students get better grades and improve the skills that they are taught in class.

Juan Mullale, a freshman in South Miami Senior High School has been receiving private tutoring services for algebra. 

"I got an F on my first test. After a couple of more lessons with my tutor, my grade in the class went up to almost a B," he said.

For more information on how to get started as a tutor or mentor for the Agape Family Life Center, visit Academic 1, Suite 210 at BBC or contact Vandon White at 305-919-5411.

Headline: Visa process frustrates international students in United States
Author: Peter Delevett/ Knight Ridder
&nbsp;
SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Abtin Keshavarzian can't go home.

The young Iranian living in Palo Alto, Calif., hasn't seen his parents and sister in Tehran, Iran, for more than two years. But visiting them could trigger a six-month wait before he could return to the United States _ if he could return at all.

"It's high-risk," said Keshavarzian, 25.

Keshavarzian isn't a criminal. Nor is he in this country illegally. He's a top engineering student at Stanford University. And he's one of tens of thousands of students nationwide caught up in new State Department rules enacted in the name of national security after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Students _ and all other visitors from dozens of countries _ must undergo new background checks and more wide-ranging interviews by U.S. consulates before they can get a visa to travel here. That process can take months, causing some students to miss semesters of school.

Foreign students who leave the country for family emergencies, to present papers at scholarly conferences or for any other reason, have to start the process all over again.

"We are denying ourselves some of the world's most talented young people," said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education. He said many of the students snared in the new red tape are studying science and technology. "It's in the national interest to attract the best and brightest from around the world."

The council estimates that half a million foreign students come to study in the United States each year. As many as 50,000 of them _ particularly those from China, Taiwan, the Middle East, India and Pakistan _ are facing some form of visa limbo like Keshavarzian.

"I have yet to come across a student from Europe having difficulty," said Gillian August-Thorp, director of international student services at Santa Clara University.

The visa policy _ which devotes closer scrutiny to students from countries thought to harbor terrorists and to those studying fields that affect national security _ has rattled campuses across the country. And the students are torn between their studies and their roots.

State Department spokesman Stuart Patt said the agency understands the new burdens put on students. In many cases, he said, consular officers are instructed to put students at the top of the visa waiting list.

At the same time, he said, "The interests of national security are primary."

Exact numbers of those affected are hard to pin down, but Stanford and San Jose State universities estimate a few dozen of their foreign students are bogged down in the visa morass. Santa Clara University reports that this fall, two students from India and one from Taiwan had to defer admission until next year after hitting visa snags.

"It is absolutely a problem," said James Plummer, Stanford engineering dean. "I get e-mails from students in China and other places who are in a panic because they can't get a visa."

Then there are students such as Keshavarzian, who are fine so long as they don't leave the United States. The engineering student knows of one classmate who had to choose between attending her father's funeral in Iran and risking a lengthy delay in her studies. She attended the funeral and was able to return to Stanford after about a month, he said.

Another Stanford student caught up in the snarl is Yang Wang, who is working toward a graduate degree in civil engineering. Feeling homesick, he went to his native China in December. He remains there, unable to return to study or even claim his belongings.

In an e-mail, Wang said he understood the need for more visa scrutiny and appreciates efforts to speed the review process.

"However, the current check system is still not satisfying enough and is still stranding a lot of innocent students for an unreasonably lengthy time," he wrote.

Patt said most student visas are processed within three weeks. But those who want to study science or technology _ like most of the foreign students who come to Silicon Valley _ undergo additional background checks by national security experts.

On top of that, students from a handful of other countries _ including China and countries believed to sponsor terrorism _ can take months longer to clear.

"An Iranian person is going to have particular problems because he's Iranian," Patt said. "If he's studying electrical engineering, he would have quite possibly a wait of many months."

That distinction frustrates Sina Zahedi, 27, an Iranian who's studying information theory at Stanford.

The clearance checks don't stop once students reach the states. Zahedi said he was offered a summer job at Bell Labs but was delayed by months of government background checks and ultimately had to turn it down. His friend Reza, who didn't want his last name printed for fear of reprisals back home, reported the same experience after getting an offer from Mountain View, Calif., chip-maker Nvidia.

Students and educators say the visa interview process can be arbitrary. Reza said he went through three interviews in three countries before a consular official finally approved him. (Because the United States doesn't have diplomatic relations with Iran, Iranian students have to travel at their own expense to another country for visa vetting.)

"Obviously colleges and universities want to take all appropriate actions, but we also want a process that is transparent and coherent," said Hartle, whose group represents 1,800 colleges and universities.

He also worries that the harder it is for foreign students to come to the United States, the more appealing universities in countries such as Australia, Britain and South Africa appear. That could lead to a university brain drain and hurt the U.S. economy, he said.

Indeed, Stanford students and employees say that last year about a half-dozen foreign students waiting for visas gave up and applied to schools in other countries.

Reza, who is studying chip design, now advises friends back home to study in Europe or Canada. "It's not worth the hassle," he said gloomily. "I'm kind of sick of this."

Headline: Internship programs expose students to professional world
Author: Carolina Sarassa/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Many students wonder about whether or not they will find the job of their expectations when they graduate. One way to start getting involved and gaining ground experience is by participating in an internship program.

FIU's Career Services Department defines an internship "as an experience that will afford you priceless opportunities to explore career options." Getting an internship is a great way to make connections, do better in school, and students are more likely to start with higher salaries when they have had previous experience.

Internships are designed to provide students with work related to their field of study prior to graduation. Although some internships are either paid or awarded class credits, most students get involved to get some experience and to make more informed decisions about their career.

According to Claudia Reich, Career Consultant at Career Services, an internship is recommended to all students. She says that when it gets to the point of who gets the job, the recruiter is more likely to hire the person with the most experience rather that the person with the highest G.P.A. 

"I encourage students to join Panther Link and get involved in clubs," Claudia says. "They have a much greater chance of getting hired."

"It is a great idea for students to get internships because it is a direct exposure in their profession," said Jaime Canaves, director of Research at the School of Architecture and Interior Design. "In an internship, the student learns what cannot be taught at school."

Students can start seeking internships as early as in their freshman year, but typically it is done in their junior or senior year or in graduate school. It is not impossible to get an internship, but you have to apply and follow up with your updated resume and interviews.

Some students assume only connections will land you an internship.

"You have to be friends with a professor to get an internship," said TV production major Carmen Ayala.

But this is not necessarily the case, FIU provides students with these services. 

Internships are the first step to get involved in the "real world" of your field of study. Career Services encourages students to try to obtain one even if it is not a requirement. 

For some majors like architecture, an internship is a requirement. Canaves explained that if a student does not complete two years of interning, he or she cannot get a license.

For other majors, even though is not mandatory, it is highly advised. 

"It is not only having a diploma in let's say journalism. To get a good job you must show some previous work you have done to demonstrate your skills," said Michael Duarte, freelance writer for the Sun-Sentinel. 

On the other hand, programs such as TESOL (Teaching English as a Second Language) provide hands-on experience that may make it unnecessary for students to participate in an internship program. 

"I do not advise my students to get internships in this master's program because they do other things as field assignments," said Aixa Perez, assistant professor of The foundation / Prof. Studies Department. 

The Political Science Department does not require internships, but it offers them such as judicial internships. 

"In political science, it is not a requirement but an option to gain practical experience," said Christopher L. Warren, associate professor of Political Science. 

 Involvement in the job market while in school can be an advantage for students. Many internships result in a permanent position at the company. 

"I started working as an intern in a firm doing some accounting, and after I finished the internship, a position opened and guess who got the job," said Marcos Villaverde, a junior and accounting major, "they gave me the job."

Many students believe an internship is a great opportunity, but don't know how to get one.

"I am a psychology major, and I'll love to intern, but I do not know how," said Juliana Orozco, a sophomore in the program. 

To that end, Career Services at both campuses sponsors career and internship fairs throughout the school year.

Headline: Homecoming packed with entertainment, school spirit
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's second annual homecoming week kicked off this year with a parade spanning a distance of more than a mile and culminated with an awards ceremony that took place Oct. 25 in the Wolfe University Center ballroom on the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Homecoming week, which this year bore the title "Homecoming Reloaded," was arranged by a group of students known as the Homecoming Committee. 

In order to successfully carry out the week's events, the Homecoming Committee is divided up into subcommittees, some of which include the lip synch contest, marketing, and the awards ceremony. 

"The purpose of the parade was to kick off homecoming week and to spread the news about the upcoming events to the community," said Julie Leos, assistant director of planning on the homecoming committee.

This year's opening parade began at Coral Park High School. 

Some of the participating organizations, which included the Student Programming Council, the Residence Hall Association, and Greek organizations, handed out free candy and t-shirts.

After the parade came back to FIU, the participants began a party in front of the Golden Panther Arena, where free food and drinks were served and a disc jockey provided entertainment.

This party preceded Panther Prowl, a show which took place in Golden Panther Arena on the night of Oct. 18. 

Perhaps the most widely publicized attraction at this event was the stage performance of Tommy Davidson of "In Living Color" fame. 

"Everybody got to meet him. He was super-audience and committee friendly," Leos said.

The lawn decorating contest took place the following Sunday afternoon. 

On the evening of Oct.20, students were able to meet members of FIU's basketball teams in the Golden Panther Arena.

"It's a way for the school to incorporate the basketball team in homecoming week," said Leos. 

Tuesday night's Lip Synching contest was held in the Golden Panther Arena, unlike last year's, which was held in the GC ballrooms.

"We moved it to the GPA in order to allow more students to get the full experience. It's a little more expensive but it's worth it," Leos said.

Each of the 14 partipating organizations, which included SPC, SOC, residence halls and Greek societies, not only lip-synched a popular song, but also danced. 

Biscayne Bay was not without its own events celebrating FIU's homecoming week.

On Oct. 22, BBC  held a Panther Power pep rally and date auction in the Wolfe University Center Panther Square. 

The date auction was coordinated by Panther Power, the Biscayne Bay Campus version of Panther Rage.

"We had [the radio station 103.5 FM, the Beat) come out here. You could win t-shirts, hats and tickets to concerts," said Janette Francois, a member of SPC. 

On Thursday night, BBC had a step show. Francois coordinated this event.

The Homecoming Court, traditionally a staple of homecoming week, was elected on Oct. 22 and 23 in the GC forum on the University Park campus and in AC1 100 on the Biscayne Bay Campus.

The night of Oct. 24 brought the Panther Cage Slumber Party, which began on the FIU Community Football Stadium field at 11 p.m. This was the first such event in FIU history.   

"We're doing this for the first time this season and hopefully it'll become a tradition," said Christian Monne, part of the events management and game promotion sectors of the Athletics Department.    

"Both the Homecoming Council and the Athletic Department coordinated this event," said Edwin Perez, the football game committee chairperson. 

Groups of students who attended were encouraged to stay for the entire night until 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, when they would be treated to IHOP pancakes free-of-charge. These students set up their sleeping gear and sometimes entire tents on the field, either playing cards or Connect 4, tossing around a football or just simply talking to friends.

"It seems like a cool way to spend a Friday night," said senior Meghan Brown, who did camp out on the field for the entire night.

At 1 a.m., the movie Bad Boys 2 was shown on a giant make-shift screen erected just a few minutes before. 

All went well until some technical difficulties and a brief rainstorm cut the movie short. 

The next morning, the FIU Golden Panthers  football team defeated the visiting Holy Cross 34 - 23. During halftime, the Homecoming Court was announced. Malik Wilkes was crowned king; Christine Denton, queen; Alex Prado, prince and Monica Valladeres, princess.

That night, a semiformal dance and awards ceremony took place at BBC. Winners of individual contests were announced. 

Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi Sigma Sigma won the lip synch contest. There was a tie in the banner contest between the Student Programming Council and Tao Kappa Epsilon and Alpha Kappa Psi. Pi Kappa Phi and Alpha Xi Delta were deemed the winners of both the float and lawn decorating contests.

Headline: SGA provides newspapers for students
Author: Gosia Darwin/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Student Government Association launched a pilot of The Newspaper Readership Program Oct. 13 on the University Park campus, providing The Miami Herald, The New York Times and USA TODAY to students at no charge Monday through Friday, on calendar school days. 

During the pilot program, the papers are delivered to the UP campus at no cost and placed in open racks. After about a month, the regular program will begin. The papers will be kept in bins equipped with student ID card scanners, to make sure that only FIU students can use the service. The distribution and the card reading machines are provided by the newspapers.

The papers are available at four locations: Graham Center, Green Library, Panther Hall and the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences.

"We allocated $19,989 for those locations," said Alejandra Cordovez, a chairperson of Academic Affairs, who is in charge of the program at UP. "We receive the total of 501 papers, 167 of each title, which are available to students every day." 

The money covers the program at UP until the end of the 2004 Summer A session, and it is coming from the president's reserve discretionary account, said Clayton Solomon, UP Student Government Council president. That account is funded by the activities and service fee paid by students in their tuition, $9.14 per credit hour. 

"This is the time when students can see the fees they pay go directly back to them," Solomon said.

Many students are excited.

"I buy The Miami Herald every morning on my way to school. Now I can pick it up here," said Gabriel Trujillo, a freshman and Business Management major. 

Lindsey Pill-Taylor, junior and chemistry major, is fond of the program, but at the same time she is concerned about the costs. 

"I am an international student and my tuition is very high," she said. "I wouldn't want to see a tuition increase because of this service."

But that will not happen, Cordovez assures. There is enough money coming from the existing student fees to pay for the program. 

All three papers come to FIU at discounted rates: 50 percent off the regular price for The Miami Herald and USA TODAY, and 60 percent off The New York Times street price.

Each month SGA will pay only for copies taken out of the bins. The remaining papers will be picked up at the end of the day and recycled. 

BBC, home to most journalism majors, is supposed to join the program after the pilot stage at UP is over. If that happens, the papers will be available at the Wolfe University Center. 

The source of funding for BBC, however, has not yet been decided. 

Nicaise Parillon, BBC-SGC president, hopes that the money to pay for the program on her campus, roughly $5,000, will come from what was left in last year's budget of the Lectures Committee, a university-wide account.  

Solomon at UP suggests sponsorship from the Academic Affairs department.

The Newspaper Readership Program is popular across the country, and was pioneered by Pennsylvania State University in 1997, according to PSU's official website. 

The idea was soon adopted by number of colleges, and today about 250 take advantage of the program, choosing the papers that are most demanded by their students.

"[Members of UP-SGC] found out about it and we thought it was a great idea," Solomon said. They conducted a survey among about 300 students at UP to see what their newspaper reading habits were. 

The survey asked students which papers they read and how often. It also asked whether students would read the papers if free copies were available. 

Based on that data, the UP-SGC chose the three papers. 

The survey was also intended to measure students' familiarity with the current events in their community and their country. 

"Every student knows who the 'American Idol' winner is, but they don't know who their attorney general is," Solomon said. 

He hopes that the program will raise cultural, community and political awareness, which will benefit students in the long run.

"That's important for student government, because we try to get people to vote in elections," Solomon said. "Only then, students will have political power that will prevent tuition increase and save scholarships."

The participating papers also see the big picture. 

"Our overall goals are to stimulate critical thinking and promote life-long learning," said Scott Brown, the educational manager of the southeast division of The New York Times, one of the partners in the program. "We want to encourage responsible citizenship." 

The New York Times contributes to the Newspaper Readership Program in about 180 colleges across the country, Brown said. 

But the papers also view the program as a long time investment. 

"We hope that students will develop life-long reading habit of the newspaper," said Vannetta Bailey-Iddrisu, the manager of Educational Services at The Miami Herald. The paper has been participating in a similar readership program at the University of Miami since 2001. 

USA TODAY, apart from providing its own newspapers, is also managing and coordinating day-to-day operations of the program for FIU. 

"Most of the programs we are involved in country-wide; we also manage," said Diane Harris, senior accounting manager at the paper's South Florida division. "It makes it easier for the universities and for our partners."  

Their employees handle billing and campus distribution of all participating newspapers. They also collect the remaining copies for recycling. 

Although faculty and staff will not be able to pick up the free papers after the student ID card scanners are in place, UP-SGC is expecting that teachers will take advantage of the program.	

"We want the teachers to somehow incorporate the newspapers into the curriculum," Solomon said. "So that they encourage students even more to take advantage of that service."

Headline: Stellastarr*: Trying to jump on the indie bandwagon
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Thirty seconds into "In The Walls," the first track off Stellastarr*'s self-titled debut album, I couldn't help but sigh; yet another '80s retro, Joy Division-ish wannabe effort from New York. It seems like we can't get enough of this music, which we love to call "indie rock," the seemingly all-purpose name given these days to bands like Stellastarr*. 

They follow in the wake of other fresh bands such as Hot Hot Heat, Interpol and the Raveonettes (whom they opened for in a recent tour). Stellastarr* comes with a vast array of influences, mostly taken from bands in the post-punk of the late '70s and '80s with a bit of early '90s indie rock infused in there. Think the Pixies, the Breeders, Talking Heads and that weird guy with the funky voice from the B-52's. Listing all those bands doesn't quite do them justice, though, because they boast a unique twist that may not be so easy to pick up right away. 

Unfortunately, they've already been beat. Simply put, Stellastarr* sounds like a band who's trying to jump on the bandwagon at the last minute. There's nothing technically wrong with this album. "Jenny" and "My Coco" are great examples of their ability to write good-quality bouncy songs that will inevitably make you bounce as well. There's also a nice contrast of slower and darker tunes such as "Untitled" and "Moongirl."  They're slick lyrics are fun, quirky and honest when appropriate. 

What's wrong with this album   is its replayability, or I should say lack of thereof. After a few run-throughs of the album, it gets a little boring. It begins to blend together and the album eventually blobs into something that sounds like a forty-five minute song. Maintaining your listener and creating an album that has infinite replay value is no easy task, so I give Stellastarr* credit for a job well done.

They will begin a tour with dark brit-poppers, Placebo in December and hopefully get the chance to take on a new avenue of musical inspiration. As other bands in their indie-rock niche are, Stellastarr* is but a hatchling, with more than enough time to establish a sound that's a bit more original. They've got the right minerals to do this, so I'll keep an eye out for these guys and in the meantime place them in my dance-mix bin.

Headline: Legal downloading still not viable enough option for music fans
Author: Jim Farber / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
Why pay for something when you can get it for free? Even if it means stealing it.

That seems to be the thinking of the public regarding the legal downloads sanctioned by the record companies. According to a new SoundScan chart tabulating such things - through industry-approved vehicles including iTunes, pressplay and MusicNet -  the country's most downloaded song last week was Outkast's "Hey Ya!"

It managed to inspire only 2,010 transactions. And that's at a paltry 99 cents a pop. By comparison, the most purchased single in retail stores was Mercy Me's "Can Only Imagine." 

It sold some 6,572 copies, topping Outkast's download figure by more than three-to-one. That's in a medium considered an utter why-bother by record companies - and at a price three times what downloads cost.

Of course, SoundScan is notorious for initially undercounting a new market. But even allowing for a 50 percent lowballing, the medium would still hardly generate enough cash to pay for a star photo shoot. At this point, a song can make the list's Top 10 with just 776 downloads (for Sarah McLachlan's "Fallen"). The 10th most purchased CD single at retail, The Eagles' "Hole in the World," moved four times that.

However tiny the market for legal song downloads may be, it's interesting which tracks inspire purchases.

The second most-bought song on last week's chart was "Stacy's Mom" by the far-from-mainstream, smarty-pants pop group Fountains of Wayne. The cut isn't available in retail stores. So only the Internet option gives listeners the chance to get what they want - the song - without having to shell out for the whole CD.

Some artists seem to inspire multiple song downloads. Among the list's Top 50, you'll find five songs by Ben Folds, 10 by Dido. Sources at those artists' companies say they haven't offered any special promotions to sell their artists over this medium.

It may just be that those stars' fans happen to be big owners of Apple machines, since that company's iTunes remains the public's preferred method of downloading.

Free downloads, however illegal they may be, still dominate the business. 

In addition to the price difference, another reason the paid services have fared so poorly is that listeners find that, other than iTunes, most are too restrictive in their purchasing rules. This week, however, Apple announced that iTunes will also be available to Windows and AOL users.

Will this have a big impact on SoundScan's download list? Probably not right away. But if the industry plays its cards right, it could be one small step on the way.

Headline: Elliott Smith dies at 34, leaves behind unreleased material
Author: Tom Moon / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
To most consumers of pop music, Elliott Smith blipped on the screen exactly once - when his hushed song "Miss Misery," written for the closing credits of the 1997 film "Good Will Hunting," became a hit and was nominated for an Oscar.

But to a smaller constellation of listeners, Smith, found dead in his Los Angeles apartment Tuesday night from an apparently self-inflicted stab wound to the chest, was one of the most promising poets of the post-grunge era.

Smith, 34, was an omnivore whose recordings threaded motifs from sunny `60s pop and shoe-gazing `80s mope-rock and folk into revelatory, multihued music. He wasn't a maverick in the Kurt Cobain sense. Or a satyr consumed by passion, like the late Jeff Buckley.

Though he lived with his girlfriend, he was an artistic recluse who observed life from a perch in the corner. His lyrics were thoughtful commentaries disguised as ragged, extemporaneous monologues. But as he pondered loneliness and human cruelty, Smith's acidic words and painfully sharp perceptions were softened by his easygoing melodies, which had a boyish innocence. 

In "Tomorrow Tomorrow," on his 1998 album XO, Smith described fame in typically withering terms - "They took your life apart, they called your failures art" - as the music bubbled happily underneath, lessening the sting. Like many of his heroes - Nick Drake, Brian Wilson - darkness was Smith's muse. He sang about rejection with a wistful air, and could sound as if he were enduring an ordeal and romanticizing its aftershocks at the same time.

Smith, who was working on music for a CD planned for the spring, struggled with depression and drug and alcohol addiction. In interviews, he could be sullen and cranky, and on stage he sometimes looked profoundly uncomfortable. He spoke haltingly, in cryptic mumbles, and though he was forthright about his addictions, he said his lyrics were not autobiographical.

"I don't feel like my songs are particularly fragile or revealing," the Nebraska native, who grew up in Dallas and Portland, Ore., told the Los Angeles Times in 1998. "It's not like a diary, and they're not intended to be any sort of super-intimate, confessional singer-songwriterish thing."

Indirectly, of course, Smith's experiences did enrich his songs. He knew what faltering felt like, the effort it takes to keep one's soul together and then to lose. His music was profound without being corny as it expressed empathy for those caught in hardly heroic daily struggles.

For all their introspection, Smith's narratives were never self-obsessed. Part of the credit goes to his musical curiosity: Where other singer-songwriters use a spiderweb of acoustic-guitar arpeggios as their constant backdrop, Smith wrote in a diverse range of styles. 

Some of his buoyant, impossibly melodic songs ("Sweet Adeline," "Bled White") recall the florid psychedelia of The Beatles, while others ("Waltz #2") are set in a stately Germanic oompah rhythm. 

He was good at agitated rock - before setting off on his own, he was in a fondly-remembered Portland band called Heatmiser. And while he was expert at elaborate vocal chorales, he was equally at home singing plaintive guy-with-guitar songs.

Smith - who said he started calling himself Elliott in middle school because his real name, Steve, was too "jockish" - began his solo career with the 1994 album Roman Candle. 

But it wasn't until 1997's Either/Or that he began to attract widespread attention. XO, the following year, was hailed as the work of a major talent and turned up on many critics' best-of-year lists.

"Miss Misery," which is on the Good Will Hunting soundtrack but none of Smith's solo albums, illustrated the ephemeral nature of pop fame. When the movie was hot, his dejected little song seemed to be everywhere, but the attention didn't translate into sustained sales of his own works. The masterly XO failed to connect with the older listeners who might have appreciated the sophistication of his compositions.

Though he performed occasionally, Smith spent most of the last two years writing and recording. He issued a seven-inch single - Pretty (Ugly Before) - on Seattle's Suicide Squeeze label in August, and had composed at least two discs' worth of material for a set tentatively titled From a Basement on the Hill.

Smith's label, DreamWorks Records, had no comment about the project.

Headline: As election gets under way, politics pop up in prime time
Author: Glenn Garvin / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
If California's recent gubernatorial recall election struck you as alarmingly like an episode of "American Idol," brace yourself: A Hollywood producer is pitching a show called "American Candidate" on which 100 contestants vie to become a "people's candidate" for president next year.

"It's a good concept, a very good concept for a show," says Pete Liguori, president of Rupert Murdoch's FX cable network, which seriously considered "American Candidate" before bowing out. "The only reason we turned it down was money - it proved to be a pretty costly project once we went over the numbers."

Expense aside, several broadcast executives say they expect "American Candidate" to land somewhere on television next year. The show's producer, R.J. Cutler, says it's inevitable: "Politics and television live at the same intersection. There's no news in that."

The idea of choosing an American president on a game show might seem like a scene trimmed from the bitter TV satire "Network." 

But as the 2004 presidential campaign approaches, it's getting harder to tell television fantasy from political fact: TV sets click on all over Washington, D.C., Sunday nights as the starstruck city tunes in to watch itself on HBO's "K Street," an insider drama about sleazy lobbyists in which saber-toothed spinmasters James Carville and Mary Matalin play themselves. "Holy (bleep), are people watching the thing!" exclaims CNN "Crossfire" combatant Tucker Carlson, a confirmed addict.

NBC's White House policy-opera "The West Wing," widely believed to be headed for a Nielsen-ratings recall last season, just won its fourth straight best-drama Emmy - and its ratings are stronger than ever.

Nowhere was the flicker between image and reality more confusing than the California recall election, fought out on late-night talk shows right to the bitter end, when the defeated Gray Davis used David Letterman's show to offer a Top 10 list of sarcastic suggestions to victor Arnold Schwarzenegger. ("No. 8: "Listen to your constituents - except Michael Jackson.")

The recall election didn't just SEEM like a TV show - it WAS a TV show: The Game Show Network's "Who Wants to Be Governor of California?" in which five dozen of the real candidates competed for viewer votes to win a $21,000 campaign contribution. Winner: Porn actress Mary Carey, who promised to tax breast implants.

The idea that his program, however whimsical, might be helping to turn U.S. elections into "American Idol" doesn't concern Game Show Network President Rich Cronin: "Watch these debates between the Democratic presidential candidates. Afterward, the pundits talk about who won, who lost, who said something stupid, who showed talent. It's really very much like `American Idol.'"

Dismissive, too, is Cutler, the veteran documentary-maker (his series on Texas college students, "Freshman Diaries," is currently appearing on Showtime) behind "American Candidate." Concerns about the malign influence of television on politics, he says, should be focused in a different direction.

"You have these very powerful cable news networks. If one or more of those news channels have a political agenda, is that a good thing? Is that a dangerous thing?" he argues. "I worry far less about the subject of politics as entertainment."

Entertainment TV's interest in politics is nothing new - the networks have been staging dramas and sitcoms in Washington and other political settings for more than four decades. 

The results have ranged from the ludicrous (NBC's 1978 "Grandpa Goes To Washington") to the downright bizarre (UPN's 1998 "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer," in which a black butler counseled a sex-crazed Abraham Lincoln).

"There's this two-way thing between Hollywood and Washington, because both of them know that what they do is a show," says Diana McLellan, a veteran Washington gossip columnist and author of "The Girls," a history of lesbian society in Hollywood. "Each of them has this little knot of respect for the other. It is truly pathetic."

Until "The West Wing," the mutual infatuation had never produced successful offspring; TV shows set in Washington have been shunned by both viewers and critics. 

Most have followed the same pattern, derived from the 1939 James Stewart film "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington": A truthful common man goes to Washington and fights the deceitful special interests.

"I think there has been an attitude on Hollywood's part, in dealing with Washington and politics, that people wanted to see their politicians - or their government - in a certain reverential way," says Stuart Stevens, a Republican political consultant and co-producer of "K Street."

Its "cinema verite" style is bolstered by the use of real-life Washington figures - from senators like Orrin Hatch and Barbara Boxer to think-tank mavens like Kenneth Adelman - playing themselves, using mostly unscripted dialogue. 

The resulting collision of styles and cultures has produced some real Kodak moments.

In a scene where political consultant Paul Begala was supposed to be helping Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean prepare for a debate, Begala warned him not to make personal attacks on one of the other candidates, "or he'll (bleep) you like a tied dog." 

Gasped a shocked Dean: "Paul, I don't think you can say that on HBO."

Slow-moving and sometimes indecipherable in its inside-baseball approach to politics, "K Street" is the lowest-rated drama in years on HBO's powerhouse Sunday-night lineup.

But the Washington Post runs a regular George Clooney sighting feature reporting the whereabouts of "K Street's" executive producer, and the high-octane political newsletter The Hotline has Your "K Street" Summary, listing the latest power players to land cameos appearances on the show. Even journalists like Washington Post media writer Howard Kurtz and Time columnist Joe Klein have gone panting after roles.

The show's conquest of Capitol Hill appalls some. "We in Washington are very self-important people, and the people you see in `K Street' are particularly self-important," jeers Kim Hume, the Washington bureau chief of Fox News. "It's a little cabal of Washington insiders who live for this stuff. From my perspective, it's a ridiculous way to spend your time."

Others, though, say it's just an understandable fascination with seeing your friends on television. "I was watching the other night, and a guy I go duck-hunting with was standing behind James and Mary at a restaurant," says CNN's Carlson. "Four people I know were in another scene. ... It's like looking at your high school yearbook."

Headline: Legendary landscape photographer to speak at FIU
Author: Isis Iglesias / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On Wednesday Oct. 29, Photgrapher Mark Klett will lecture at  8 p.m. in Room 100 of the Green Library at UP.

Klett has been a prolific photographer for almost 30 years.  His exploration of Landscapes has taken him all around the world but many of his most renowned photographs are of the American West.  Klett's work has been informed by the early photographic pioneers who surveyed and documented that vast wilderness, especially by Timothy O'Sullivan whose images greatly inspired Klett.   

Early American photographers such as O'Sullivan, Jackson and Bell who went out west to survey and document the land and their work became the starting point of the Rephotographic Survey Project (RSP) done in 1970.  

That project and The Third View,  done in 1999 revisits the exact locations of early American Western Photographs and documents the many changes that have occurred since the land was first photographed.  Some of Klett's work can be seen on an amazing web site that documents the projects, www.thirdview.org.

Some of the transformations have been drastic like dams, roads or housing, while others are more subtle; just the growth of trees obscuring the view.   Klett's work is fascinated by this interaction of man with the land and his photographs often include the human figure somewhere whimsically in the frame, much like the work of A.J. Russell another early American Photographer. 

Mark Klett has become like many of these early photographers a national treasure. His work is featured in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and even overseas at the Antwerp Museum of Photography in Belgium.    His photographs are also the subject of several books such as View Finder:  Mark Klett, Photography and the Reinvention of Landscape and his latest book Black Rock Desert.

Klett is currently a professor at the Herberger School of Art at Arizona State University. He has a bachelor's degree in geology, which would explain his fascination and understanding of the terrain and rock formations that he photographs. 

His work is currently visiting the Art Museum at FIU in the exhibit "The Land Through a Lens."  Mark Klett is coming to FIU as part of the Museum's Wednesdays After Hours program.

Headline: "Sylvia": Yet another movie about a suicidal literary woman
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
The hot new genre in movies? Suicidal literary women and the men who love them.

First, there was "The Hours." Now, there's "Sylvia" Plath, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's an Anne Sexton movie lurking in the gray shadows. 

Suicide is a difficult movie subject - it's hard to make a character who offs herself likable, particularly if, like Sylvia Plath, she was a mother - but it can be an excellent subject if the movie helps us understand the despair that leads toward one of the most awful decisions a person can make.

In that quest, "Sylvia" has two things going for it: Gwyneth Paltrow's lucid, complex performance and the intuitive delicacy of Christine Jeffs' direction. 

Jeffs made the Australian "Rain" (available on DVD), which covered similar emotional territory: the events leading up to an act of violence that will end one life and alter others forever. 

Both "Rain" and "Sylvia" are shaky in the storytelling department, but both take advantage of Jeffs' strong visual sense to make up for flaws in the script.

"Sylvia" gets to us at a level deeper than words. 

There's a sound, like the wind on an empty desert, that pops up throughout the film, none of which is set on a desert. 

But when that wind whistles through the home Sylvia and her poet/husband Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig, who's not very good) share, it hints at the emptiness of their relationship. 

When we hear it again, during a happy moment, it warns us that the happiness is fleeting.

Jeffs sometimes references images we know - a brief shot of Plath bathing her kids uses our memory of Mary Cassatt paintings to convey the idea that Plath was a loving, dedicated mother - and creates new ones that are equally indelible. 

A close-up of Sylvia and Ted dancing, her standing on his feet, says a lot about their relationship, and a scene of teacher Sylvia, wiping a chalkboard in a deserted, meticulously arranged classroom, suggests her contained fury and frustration.

"Sylvia" isn't a victim movie or a why movie. It doesn't try to suggest what made this gifted woman, with a career and a family that needed her, kill herself. 

But it does get at her contradictions - her humor, her compassion, her depression - and its tender images hint at how awful it would be not to realize that those contradictions can make life worth living.

Parts of the movie don't work, but if you "read" it like poetry - lingering over images and themes - it's very powerful.

Headline: "Scary Movie 3": Already beaten to the punch by real scary movies
Author: Chris Hewitt / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
"Scary Movie" and "Scary Movie 2," like the "Scream" franchise, drew on the entire history of horror cliches, shocks that had been reheated so often we instantly recognized their dopiness. 

But "Scary Movie 3" is crafted almost entirely from bits of movies released in the past year - "Signs" and "The Ring," mainly - and if you haven't seen them, you're not going to follow what's going on.

	The movie tries to broaden its appeal with more generic jokes like that old faithful, the guy getting bashed in the noggin (I stopped counting at the 18th head trauma bit). 

And there are some funny digs at the pretensions and illogic of "Signs," in particular. 

	But a couple of attempts to satirize "Final Destination" reveal the downfall of the tapped-out "Scary" series: Current horror movies are so ironic, they parody themselves, which means they have beaten (and stabbed and eviscerated) "Scary Movie 3" to the punch.

Should you go? 

Close call. 

By my own personal mirthometer, there were two big laughs and several smaller ones. I'd say that makes it perfect for home viewing.

Headline: Coverage & Rocket: Moore and Mraz appeal to pop generation
Author: Robert J. Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Mandy Moore and Jason Mraz may have little in common (save perhaps looking like tweens). However, they both seem to have good knowledge about the makings of a classic. 

On Coverage, Mandy pays homage to her favorite songwriters by rerecording such great tunes as the Robert Palmer classic "Can We Still Be Friends" and Joni Mitchell's "Help Me." Her sweet voice puts a good spin on the powerful songs and infuses them with her vivacious aura.  

Unfortunately, the production on this album is not up to par.  The best tracks are the ones that are more instrument-based, such as Elton John's "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters," which allows for Mandy's vocals and the songwriting to take precedence.

Moore sings this new batch of old songs with a passion that brings new meaning to the words of "Have a Little Faith in Me" and its mates. It is easy to sense the infatuation the singer has with the tracks she chose.

A welcomed creative leap for her, Coverage proves that Mandy threw away her bubbly pop music along with her blond hair. 

Mraz takes a different approach on Waiting for my Rocket to Come. His acoustic, poetic style makes this album something of a neo-classic. This record is chalk full of the keen melodies and lyrics that formulate the songs on Coverage. His carefree yet insightful attitude gives the album a great mood, one that is hard to come by. 

Rocket is populated by a diverse group of jingles. "The Remedy" and "One Love, In Sadness" best represent Mraz's fast-talkin'/head bobbin' style. Their choruses are catchy and fun to sing, a winning characteristic among drunken college students. 

"Sleep All Day" is perhaps the jazziest of the bunch. With such enticing lyrics (sleep all day/sleep all, we sleep all day/over again Why don't we?) it is no doubt Mraz is in touch with the words people really want to hear.

It would probably never occur to anyone to link Coverage with Waiting for my Rocket to Come. With two very different concepts and sounds, the albums would probably never mingle at a cocktail party. 

Nonetheless, they do share a certain kinship; both are connected by their timelessness. Mraz's writing is carved out from the joys and trials of his generation, the very thing that makes the tracks on Coverage so meaningful. 

Whether it consists of Mandy Moore belting out vintage tunes or Jason Mraz upping the game for his generation, a classic is a classic. Both artists prove that the makings of a classic will never change or grow old.

Headline: Forelle earns chance for MTV2 exposure
Author: Joyce Fábregas / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Forelle needs your help!

The College Television Network (CTN), which can be seen around FIU and college campuses nationwide, is holding a contest called "Best Band On Campus" where campus bands send in their music videos. Local band Forelle, some of whose members attend FIU, submitted a press kit which included, among other things, their video for the song "Fractions." They were selected to be one of the top 10 finalists. 

MTV, MTV2, Atlantic Records and Dreamworks are among the many involved with this contest. Forelle's video began airing on Oct. 20 and will continue playing at 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. - top of the hours. 

Voting also began on this day and will be open until Nov. 3, when the top three finalists will be chosen and voting will start all over again. To vote, log on to www.collegetelevision.com/sweepstakes/best_music (you can vote as many times as you like). You can also access the voting page through a link on the band's web-site: www.forellemusic.com. 

The winner of the contest gets their video played on MTV2, gaining nationwide exposure and connections to producers such as Pharrell Williams who has worked with artists such as "The Neptunes." 

The video for "Fractions" was directed by former Forelle member Jesse Austin, who is currently studying cinematography and photography. The idea for the setting of this self-produced video came about when Austin's kitchen was going to be torn down for remodeling and the band was able to break down walls, tiles, and spray paint graffiti all over the walls, spending only about $7 on this creation that just might open their door to the nation. The band was pleased to have done it all themselves. They want to do as much as they can on their own, keeping the power to have control over their art. The creation of the video ironically resembles what the song "Fractions" is about; "doing what you want to do, making mistakes and overcoming them, ripping right through whatever is in your way," says James Partidge, the band's vocalist. 

Forelle's others members are Javi Bolea on electronics, Tommy Garrett on drums, Paul Austin on guitar, and Gavin Valcarce on bass. They were friends before they got together as a band. Garrett and Partridge were in another band, Twice The Sun, which was signed to Roadrunner Records, but left because they wanted to stay true to themselves. Less than two weeks later, they got together with Bolea and Garrett's old guitarist, Austin. Shortly after they brought in Valcarce and  promptly began writing songs and playing shows. 

About five months later they were truly a new band and since then "it  has been a constant evolution" according to Partridge. Their genre of music isn't exactly defined. They include pieces of different genres in their music, everything from underground electronic to straight up rock music. In laymen's terms: they'd like to call it rock because "rock is all about revolutionizing the world and that's what we're all about," says Bolea.  They also like to call themselves the "yin and yang of rock" because their music explores the beautiful and the ugly, the negative and the positive; they're aggressive yet melodic. The only way to truly understand what they're all about is to attend one of their shows. 

The band has played in such venues as the FIU ballrooms and Culture Room and their music touches a diverse crowd and people of all ages. They claim to have fans ranging from a 94 year old to a 7 year old. They believe that Miami in general is not united, but they feel that they are making great strides in bringing the community together as they see more and more familiar faces at their shows. The guys are influenced by great artists such as The Beatles, Tool, Queen, Radiohead, Deftones, and 311; but even greater influences are their relatives and personal experiences.

Forelle is working on their album with no tentative release date yet and are looking forward to touring throughout Florida by the end of the year. They are also in the process of recording another video and will soon have merchandise out such as t-shirts and stickers. Aside from the CTN contest, the band also won the first round of Hard Rock Cafe's Battle of the Bands. On Nov. 7 at 9 p.m. Forelle will be playing for a cash prize of $1,000 in the initials. The entrance cost is $7 all ages and will be at the Hard Rock in Bayside. 

The band needs all the support and votes they can get for both contests. Do your part and support Forelle, as they are representing FIU and Miami. They are an amazing band with incredible talent and are true pioneers of local rock music. Check them out, go to their shows, and vote Forelle!

Headline: Women's soccer makes comeback, erupts for six goals vs. UALR
Author: C. Joel Marino
&nbsp;
Oct. 24- FIU 6, UALR 2

After its last two games ended in draws (against Bucknell and South Florida), the FIU women's soccer team wanted to build upon last week's improvement and earn a chance to make the conference tournament.

The Golden Panthers did just that, with a 6-2 victory over host Arkansas Little Rock on Oct. 24. The win improved FIU's season record to 2-10-2 (1-4 SBC), giving new hope to the team and all of its supporters.

FIU, which had not scored more than three goals in any game this season, doubled that mark with a six-goal eruption.

"I don't even think we played that well, but we had a lot of shots on goal and we were just able to finish our opportunities," said senior Carmen Lopez.

Arkansas (5-6-2) was first to score, as a shot by Trojan Laura Cook bounced off the left post and made it past FIU goalkeeper Juliana Gomez barely eight minutes into the game.

FIU, however, tied the game at 1-1 on a goal by sophomore Janet Ligouri in the 16th minute, then took a 2-1 lead when Ligouri rebounded a shot missed by Elizabeth Durozel, driving it past UALR goalkeeper Marsha Stewart in the 26th minute. Charissa Gingerich then put FIU up 3-1 on an unassisted goal two minutes later.

UALR cut the lead to 5-2 in the 88th minute, thanks to a goal by freshman Helga Bhasker, but the Golden Panthers managed a surprise ending with a goal being scored in the final minute by sophomore Monica Savage.
	
By the end of the game, FIU had out shot UALR 17-11.

The win was important for the Golden Panthers, who desperately needed this game to have a chance to get accepted to the Sun Belt Conference Tournament.

"We needed this game to have a chance to reach the postseason. But we have to win one more on Sunday [Oct. 26] against Arkansas State, which is a do or die game. If we don't win that one, we aren't going to the tournament," Lopez said.

Oct. 26- Arkansas State 2, FIU 1

The Golden Panthers scored early, but then allowed two goals, falling to host Arkansas State, 2-1, on Oct. 26. 

The loss eliminated FIU's chances to participate in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. The Golden Panthers play two home games this week to conclude the season.
