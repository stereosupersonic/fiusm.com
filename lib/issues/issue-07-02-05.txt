Headline: Hustlers win pre-season intramural title game
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The men's pre-season basketball intramural championship game was a re-enactment of The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

The first half featured a calm, serene Dr. Jekyll, but the second half morphed into an atrocious Edward Hyde. 

The Hustlers team defeated the Terror Squad team 77-47 to capture the men's intramural championship on Jan. 31 at the University Park Recreation Center.

The 5-on-5 intramural basketball rules consist of two 20 minute halves with no stoppages. The only time the clock is stopped is when a team calls one of the time-outs each team is assigned.

The Hustlers' Ryan Wright and Terry Mayhue set a fast pace of play the Terror Squad was never able to mimic.

Wright gave the Hustlers an early lead, scoring the team's initial seven points. Wright finished with 31 points, but his counterpart, Mayhue, added 11 points and speed to maintain the upbeat tempo.

"We've been playing for two, three years now. It's natural," Wright said. "We play basketball together in everything, not just intramurals."

The Terror Squad trailed 34-29 at halftime. Outside shooting was their main source of offensive production during the first half. However, that same outside shooting betrayed them the whole second half.

Their lack of outside shooting led to a stagnate offense, which created easy scoring possibilities for the Hustlers. The Hustlers went on a 16-3 run, led by   Wright and Mayhue.

"The defense was the difference in the second half because it led to a lot of fast break shots," Mayhue said.

The second half was difficult to watch for the Terror Squad, as they were outscored 43-18. 

Jovan Fryar, who finished with 11 points, was one the most reliable scorers for the Terror Squad; however, he was not on the floor during the Hustler's 16-3 barrage, which ultimately created the huge deficit the home team was never able to recover.

He was taken out of the game due to fatigue, and he was not able to return to the game until the game was out of his team's hands.

"I was not able to get back into the game for a while after I came out," Fryar said. "Our team was tired in the second half, because we had played three days in a row."

Wright and Mayhue scored 23 of their team's 34 points in the first half. Mayhue was limited to two points in the second half because of his emphasis on passing, which included four alley-oops.

Canada Hartley took the offensive initiative in Mayhue's place as he notched nine second-half points, despite playing limited minutes.

The Terror Squad could not catch any breaks in the second half. Even when the Hustlers missed a free-throw, they managed to grab the rebound and score a lay-up.

The latter moments of the game consisted of clock wasting, sloppy defense  and one emphatic slam dunk by Ismael Ndiaye.

The Hustlers' journey to the men's basketball 5-on-5 pre-season championship began on Jan. 24 defeating Barely Legal and Supreme, Jan. 29 defeating Terror Squad.

In order to be eligible to participate in intramural club sports, FIU students must be enrolled in at least one credit hour.

Headline: Hoopstarz edge out Ballin' late for pre-season intramural title honors
Author: Xavier E. Martinez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This year's women's pre-season intramural basketball tournament was a close match between the Hoopstarz and the Ballin'. 

Both teams kept the score close, until a strong offensive performance in overtime by the Hoopstarz gave them the victory.

The 33-29 win, in addition to the previous game's 27-20 win, made the Hoopstarz this year's pre-season champions.  

The best-of-three tournament was held in the University Park Recreation Center Jan. 30. Recreation Center staff said this game may be a preview of things to come.

"These will most likely be the two teams in the regular season championships," said Matt O'Conner, intramural and club sports coordinator.

Team Ballin' took an early lead in game two and held the score at 7-5 for the first 15 minutes. A 3-point shot by Hoopstarz's Porsha Butler pulled her team ahead 8-7 with 5:43 left in the half. 

Ballin' quickly responded with a jump shot by Dana Smith, making the score 9-8.

Trailing 11-8 with 2:10 left, Butler slammed another 3-pointer, tying the score. Two more 3-pointers by both sides left the score tied at 14-14 by the end of the first half.  

The score in the second half quickly climbed to 18-14 after two shots from  Ballin's Alessandra Rosa and Katia Moles. 

With nine minutes left, Hoopstarz's Dana Smith hit two jump shots, keeping her team at 22-19. 

A successful 3-point shot by Ballin's Melissa Andrews caused the Hoopstarz to call a timeout with the score at 25-24 in Ballin's favor.

Hoopstarz's Stephanie Pita came out from the timeout with a crucial 3-point shot, which gave her team a 27-25 lead. 

The lead was lost just as quickly when Ballin' once again tied the score at 27-27 with two minutes left. 

Hoopstarz fans went wild as Ballin's Alessandra Rosa's last second jump shot rimmed out. 

Jessica Lee began Hoopstarz's 6-2 overtime run with a baseline lay up. 

Butler locked in the win by dominating the offensive boards and making four of the last six points for her team.  

"I was struggling with the girl's ball, but I adjusted," Butler said, who also runs for the track and field team. 

Rosa barely missed a shot that could've led Ballin' to victory. She is sure this was not the last meeting between these two teams. 

"We need to organize our game more," Rosa said.  "This was just a warm-up, but in the real season we're going to win."

To participate in Intramural Basketball all players must either be students, faculty, staff or alumni of FIU. A $30 entry fee is required per team.  

"Intramural sports give both students and faculty a chance to compete in the sport they love," said Adrian Duranann, intramural sports supervisor.

Headline: SUPER DREAMS: Nick Turnbull lives his childhood dream
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Chicago Bears backup safety Nick Turnbull used to ride his bike past Joe Robbie Stadium as a child and tell his mother how he would be playing in that stadium one day. However, he never thought he'd be playing in Joe Robbie - now Dolphin Stadium - in a Super Bowl.

The former Golden Panthers safety's road to the Super Bowl XLI has been full of twists and turns.

Coming out of high school, Turnbull wasn't even eligible to play due to his grades and SAT scores.

Although he was taking night classes and studying to retake his SAT's, it reached a point in which he started working at Publix as a produce assistant. The former All-Broward safety drew interest from schools, such as Georgia, until they found out about his academics.

Although Georgia and other major universities stopped persuing him, former FIU head football coach Don Strock continued to show interest in Turnbull.

After becoming eligible, he decided to remain loyal to Strock and play for the Golden Panthers. Through it all, Turnbull remained positive and up beat, praying for a shot to play.

"Whenever it's going to get dark, it's going to get brighter eventually," Turnbull said. "A lot of people's abilities are the same. Some people just want it more than others."

Just a year removed from FIU, Turnbull has already shared the field with some of the NFL's elite players like Brian Urlacher, Devon Hester, Warrick Dunn and Michael Vick. Once the star shock wore off, Turnbull realized he was built for the NFL.

"I thought the speed was going to be faster," Turnbull said. "I thought everyone was going to be stronger. You actually surprise yourself. You see these guys running on TV and when you run next to them, you're like, 'Hey I can run with them, too.' But before you do it, you're unsure you can."

Although he was keeping up with Atlanta Falcons receivers step for step in practice, he wasn't excused from the rookie hazing that most rookies around the league receive.

 Often times, he would have to carry veterans' pads and equipment off the field or buy all the defensive backs drinks when they would go out.

"A couple times, I had to leave for D'Angelo Hall to get him Sonics," he said. "I had to leave the facility to go get him some fast food."

Turnbull's days as D'Angelo Hall's servant would be short lived as the Falcons would release him, only to have the Chicago Bears claim him off waivers two days later.

"I didn't know the Bears picked me up because the NFL computers crashed," Turnbull said. "The Bears called me and said, 'Hey you're talking to your new boss.'"

On Dec. 12, Turnbull exchanged the fair Atlanta weather for the Windy City of Chicago. When he first arrived to his new city, he was greeted with snow, snow and more snow.

"I lived in Miami my whole life. I'm in Atlanta [and] I thought 45 degrees is freezing," Turnbull said. "I get off the plane. I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt. It's like 15 degrees and there's snow everywhere, and I'm like, damn."

The weather proved to be the most difficult change for Turnbull to adjust to. On-the-field adjustments, on the other hand, proved to be easy.

As a member of the Bears special teams unit, Turnbull didn't understand why the Bears have been tagged as underdogs the whole season. 

Even though his team went up against one of the best offenses in the NFL, Turnbull still believed that the Bears would pull out a victory. 

Turnbull said he was just happy to be part of the Super Bowl and he understands what a great defense his team has.

Heading into training camp next season, Turnbull will be looking to expand his role on the Bears defense.

"The Bears have one of the best defenses in the NFL, so there's no reason to fix what's not broke," he said.

Being from South Florida, teammates have constantly been asking him directions and asking him to take them out to South Beach.

Although he didn't expect to play a huge role against the Indianapolis Colts, Turnbull believes he'll be able to have a more prominent role on the team next year.

"I always just thought of going to the NFL," he said. "I never really thought about playing in the Super Bowl."

Headline: Social networking sites pose a danger to America's youth
Author: Celine Pelofi / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Do you have a MySpace? Is your face on Facebook?  Because the seemingly innocent social networking sites on the web that you know and love can be used against you in frightening ways and, quite possibly, in a court of law. 

While many consider their MySpace or Facebook use nothing more than an entertaining hobby and an easy way to communicate with their friends, there is a darker side to these "spaces" that many overlook.

Just recently, six ninth grade girls in Chattanooga, Tenn. were charged with homicide conspiracy and were taken to a juvenile facility, because of a list posted on all six of the girls' MySpace pages. The list, which police say included the word "kill" in the title, included about 300 names.

The potential victims included student athletes, classmates, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise and the Energizer Bunny.

It all might sound amusing to you, but there were many students that stayed home from school because their names were on the list. Now the girls may have to face serious penalties if convicted. 

It could have simply been an innocuous joke played by a group of 14 and 15-year-old girls, but the truth of the matter is that it wasn't really comical at all.

That is not the only problem that has arisen from use of the website. There have been numerous accounts of predators creating profiles and using them to connect with teens. 

In New York, one sex offender was caught because police found the online evidence of conversations he had with teens and comments he had written to them.

Furthermore, MySpace and the many websites of its ilk have been the cause of many misunderstandings. 

The University of Dayton recently performed a study that found that 42 percent of employers surveyed would factor in an applicant's online profile when deciding whether or not to hire them. A growing number of people may find themselves turned down for a job because they decided to make their private life public by posting the most intimate details about their life on the Internet.

People who enjoy chatting on MySpace, Facebook and websites like it should use them with exceeding caution. 

 Know whom you are accepting as a friend, because you can never be 100 percent assured that the person is who they say they are and you don't want to regret it later.

 Also, know your limits. Be vigilantly aware of what you write on your profile or anyone else's, because anything you post can become embarrassing, incriminating and potentially endanger your reputation and quite possibly your life. 

Who can really say how many stalkers have used the resources on these sites to feed their obsessions and learn the most personal details about the objects of their fixations.

A website is not worth the risk of losing a friend or possibly being stalked.MySpace and Facebook ultimately cause more problems and headaches than they do good. 

Children and teens are becoming addicted to this form of communication that can make them more vulnerable, and adults have found that problems can arise for them as well. Life can be far less complicated and to a large extent safer without using these sites. Your "space" could be invaded and your life ruined. Consider yourself warned.

Headline: NEOCONS TO IRAN: YOU'RE NEXT
Subheadline: Invading Iran a bad idea
Author: Chris Cabral / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
"I say we nuke the bastards!" says ultraconservative Radio/T.V. talk show host Glenn Beck when talking about Iran. 

Unfortunately, this sentiment is not limited to mere entertainers. Bill Kristol, respected editor of The Weekly Standard, has repeatedly called for the use of force against Iran. In an interview with Fox News, he also said that a military confrontation with Iran is not only justified, but it could come "sooner than you think." Authors Ann Coulter, Charles Krauthammer and possible 2008 presidential candidate Newt Gingrich have all joined this growing chorus of far-right extremists who say that the U.S. should hurry up and invade Iran before Bush leaves office.

These individuals are the intellectual descendents of the people who pleaded with Nixon to spread the Vietnam War into Cambodia as a means of defeating the Vietcong. That didn't work, but that won't stop them from suggesting a similar strategy for Iraq. 

Many of the people talking up the threat of Iran also claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that the Iraqi people would greet us with open arms and delicious candy. That didn't happen, but that certainly won't stop them from saying the same thing about Iran.

They imply that the U.S. military can somehow occupy Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran - a country over 3 times the size of Iraq - simultaneously. That seems impossible, but once again, these people will not allow historical precedent or the facts to affect their opinions.

Kristol and other neoconservatives claim that an attack on Iran would cause the people to rise up and overthrow their government. The problem with that argument is that there is a well-known phenomenon of public opinion known as the "rally around the flag effect" (Mueller, 1970). The fear of war and its consequences make people support their government more, not less.

President Bush has benefited from this effect himself. After the events of 9/11, Bush's previously dismal approval rating soared to over 90%. Even many of his political opponents supported him out of fear for their lives and the country. When people are afraid or at war, they rally around their leaders. Attacking Iran, or even constantly threatening them, will only strengthen Ahmadinejad's public support.

Moreover, Iran will only accelerate its nuclear ambitions if they feel threatened. During the cold war, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were the fiercest of enemies. While they did arm and support opposing factions in different wars for and against communism around the globe, they never engaged in direct conflict. Why? Because they both had nuclear weapons, and neither country wanted to get "nuked".

Consequently, if Iran had nuclear weapons, the U.S. would be unable to invade them. If we were to engage Iran's leaders in diplomatic talks - a strange concept to some - and negotiate with them, they would feel less threatened by the U.S. and less likely to feel they need such weapons. After all, our president has called them part of the "axis of evil". Our army is occupying a neighboring country, and countless pundits are now saying the U.S. could attack them "sooner than you think." They have every reason to fear us. Of course they're going to want nuclear weapons to defend themselves.

­­	Thankfully, it appears that most Americans just aren't going along with the neoconservatives on this one. A recent CNN poll placed public support for a war with Iran at a chilly 28 percent. And the results of the past election seem to indicate a shift in opinion against the more militant members of the political elite. Rather than support a move to invade a third country, most seem to think we have our hands full with Iraq and Afghanistan. After all, we can't just attack everyone we disagree with.

"Kill 'em all" is not a security strategy, it's a Metallica song.

Headline: Alumnus creates religious club
Author: Lauren Agosto / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Muslims. Christians. Jews. John Nardone, founding president of the Faith at Work Alumni Chapter, prides himself in making a "faith-friendly" organization that welcomes all different religions.

"You cannot be two different people, one at home and another at work. Your faith is a part of you; it makes you whole," Nardone said.

Nardone, a FIU alumnus, felt that a faith-based networking group was needed in the University community.

Although the program hasn't been officially implemented yet, Faith at Work is not closed off to any religions. It is open to anyone who wishes to have the opportunity to network with others who share the same morals and values.

To open the chapter, Nardone went to different alumni events and spoke with alumni who also showed interest in creating the chapter. 

Outside the workplace, the Faith at Work Alumni Chapter will be doing their part to help out the community. They plan to mentor middle and high school students in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, as well as mentor foster children in order to encourage them to pursue their own careers.

In the future, they plan to extend the program outside FIU, begin a faith-based outreach program throughout the community, and organize mission trips to different countries.

Nardone said Faith at Work would like to use the organization to promote a sense of unity at FIU, but for now, they're starting with students from the College of Law who will be spearheading the group. So far, there are about 100 members in the group, according to Nardone.

Leonard P. Strickman, dean of the College of Law, is proud of the work the group is trying to achieve. 

"Their speakers are respected professionals," Strickman said. He was referring to the speakers that will be attending the group's first meeting. "If its work is a vehicle for inculcating ethical standards for legal practice, it will serve a positive end, which should be commended by all."

The chapter plans on holding various events. Their first event will be held Feb. 15 in the College of Law building, room 1000. This event is the first in a series, which will provide mentoring to students in their job search with a faith friendly focus.

Speakers at this meeting will be David W. Miller, the keynote speaker; Ralph L. Gazitua, Alfred A. Porro and Joan A. Porro, who are retired attorneys.

Miller is executive director of the Center for Faith and Culture at Yale University and assistant professor of Business Ethics at Yale's School of Management. His new book, God at Work deals with the same ideas that the Faith at Work Chapter wishes to encourage. Miller will speak about how faith-based morals and ethical integrity are directly related to bottom line performance and litigation risk reduction. He will also be holding a book signing after the meeting.

Gazitua is president of Drug Free Youth In Town, an organization dedicated to recognizing children and pre-teens living a drug-free life, and is a chaplain for both the Miami-Dade Police Department and Everglades Correctional Center. He will discuss morals and ethical integrity as keys to success in the workplace.

The Porros feel that Faith at Work is going to be a beneficial organization for FIU students and graduates.

"We would like FIU graduates to be armed with the benefit of the career experience that we have lived, now lecture extensively on, and know will cross every graduate's path," Alfred said. "The need to have the awareness of the role of moral conscience and faith in business, law and a full life is essential - especially in this era."

Headline: Law college  celebrates completion
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU College of Law will be celebrating the completion of its new home, the Rafael Diaz-Balart Hall, Feb. 10 in a grand display of what the college has to offer.

The hall is named after U.S. Congressmen Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart's late father, a prominent politician within Miami's Cuban exile community. 

"[Feb. 10] will mark the next in a series of historic dates for the FIU College of Law," said Leonard P. Strickman, the dean of the College of Law in a press release.

A free continental-like breakfast will be served at 8:30 a.m. in the building's north Courtyard. In addition to the breakfast, College of Law students will give tours of the hall.

According to Paulina Muñoz, the college's special events coordinator, the most interesting and important areas of the Diaz-Balart Hall - such as the Grand Atrium, Legal Clinic and both of the fully operational teaching courtrooms - will be showcased.

The guest of honor of the dedication ceremony will be United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who will be giving a keynote address at 10:30 a.m. in the Pharmed Arena. Seating is free on a first come first serve basis and open to anyone in the community.  

Strickman hopes College of Law Students will have a chance to have a one-on-one discussion with Justice Ginsburg beyond her keynote address.

"We are celebrating many things," Strickman said. "The life of Rafael Diaz-Balart, Robert Stern - the architect who designed the hall - and the advancement of the law school."

On Feb. 8 "The Intersection of United States Constitutional Law With International And Foreign Law" Symposium will take place leading up to the Feb. 10 dedication.

"We have the top scholars [of the topics being discussed] coming in," Muñoz said. Starting at 2 p.m. in the College of Law Auditorium, the first day of the symposium will explore the context of America's constitutionally based civil rights and the international human rights as identified in the Geneva Convention.

Speakers for the first day of the symposium include Harold Koh, the Dean of the Yale Law School; Erwin Chemerinsky, a professor of the Yale Law School; Christopher Edley Jr., the Dean of the School of Law at Boalt Hall Berkeley; and Aya Gruber, a professor at FIU's College of Law. 

During the symposium, speakers will address how the United States is losing its role of leadership in human rights worldwide.

The symposium will kick back up at 9:00 a.m. on Feb. 9 in the College of Law Auditorium. At that time, speakers will focus on the debate over the U.S. courts using foreign law sources to help inform its definitions on due process, equal protection and other concepts from the U.S. constitution.

Speakers for Feb. 9 include Drew Days III, a professor of the Yale Law School; Anthony D'Amato, a professor at the Northwestern University Law School; Francisco Valdes, a professor of the University of Miami Law School; and Elizabeth Foley, a professor at FIU's College of Law.

Seating is free for the symposium but limited. Registration for the symposium can be made at http://law.fiu.edu. All of the events are free and open to everyone.

Headline: A MONTH AT THE MUSEUM:Culture-hopping now possible with new pass
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
February might be known as Black History Month or when Valentine's Day is celebrated around the country but for the first time ever this year, February is also Miami Museum Membership Month.

The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum initiated and launched an unprecedented partnership with 15 area museums where membership at one museum will allow free entrance to any of the other participating museums during the month of February. 

Thea Smolinski, the museum's membership director, hopes M4, as it has come to be known, will draw greater attention from locals to the Wolfsonian. 

"This is the first time it has ever been done," Smolinski said. "Art Basel has gotten to be a tremendous event in Miami, but everyone's from out of town. It would be fantastic if we had something that got the city excited, something that was for the locals. Hopefully this will help create a greater sense of community." 

Partnerships with 15 local museums, including the Miami Art Museum, the Contemporary Museum of Art, the Patricia and Philip Frost Art Museum at University Park and Vizcaya Museum and Gardens are not the only ties to the community that the Wolfsonian has been forging over the past year. In August 2006, the Wolfsonian, which is located in the Miami Beach Art Deco district, received a $10 million grant from Miami-Dade County's Building Better Neighborhoods Bonds Program to renovate its three historic properties.

"We are grateful to the voters of Miami-Dade, who approved this grant, which will allow the Wolfsonian to deepen its relationship with the community," said Director Cathy Leff in a press release. 

Beginning last month, the Wolfsonian is also partnering with WPBT Channel 2, a Miami-based public broadcasting station, to present the Cinema 2 at the Wolf film series. The series, whose last screening will be April 20, features documentary films that focus on subjects ranging from the construction of the New York City subway system to the legendary heist of the most valuable stolen painting ever.

Julia Borsch, public programs manager, noted that in partnering with the station, the museum is also reaching out to its members and audience, helping to bring new groups to the Wolfsonian.

The museum's local efforts have also garnered national attention. In 2005, it received $70,000 in two federal planning grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities for the reinstallation of its permanent collection, which features over 100,000 artifacts of fine art, graphic design, political propaganda, furniture and even rare books and postcards. In 2006, the Wolfsonian won a $150,000 grant from the NEH to develop a "Landmarks in American History and Culture" workshop series that was attended by 93 educators from across the country.

Yet as the museum continues to have success at the county, state and national level, last year raising an additional $2 million in government grants, philanthropic gifts, memberships, sponsorships and earned income, it is looking for greater support from the FIU student community.  

Regina Bailey, assistant director of planning, explained that in 2007 the Wolfsonian hopes to develop its relationship with FIU students.

"We'd like more students to be engaged," she said. "Recently a student at Lakeview [Residence Hall] organized a group on his own and brought them to the museum, which was great. The Wolfsonian is a wonderful research opportunity for faculty and students, but can also be a rest stop between beach-going."

In the month of February alone, the Wolfsonian is featuring four exhibitions, a book club series, four film screenings, public talks, workshops and guided tours, in addition to M4 benefits. Museum officials hope to see an increase in local visitors, especially from the FIU community.

"We see [M4] as a real opportunity to motivate people to come out," Smolinski said. 

Though Bailey acknowledges that the museum may be far from some students, she thinks a visit to "the Museum of Thinkism" is worth the trip.

"We often hear from students that they would visit if only there was a bus [from FIU]. We understand, and we have negotiated discounted parking nearby for students," Bailey said. "We want students to feel like this is their place on South Beach."

Headline: Berkman appointed permanent provost
Author: C. Joel Marino and Angelina Troff / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
He's held the title of interim provost for more than a year but it took less than a week for a University search committee to recommend Ronald Berkman as the official provost, a decision finalized by President Modesto A. Maidique last week.

Although the 16-member committee had been meeting since May of last year to find a replacement for former Provost Mark Rosenberg - who left FIU to become chancellor of the Florida Board of Governors - committee head Joyce Elam said Berkman became "the overwhelming choice" after other candidates had been interviewed.

Berkman had been serving as interim provost since November 2005.

"Maidique came and gave us the charge to find the best provost, and we found that in Berkman," said committee-member Mira Wilkins.

Berkman had already been involved in many major initiatives as interim provost, including the decision to move to a three-day class schedule starting next Fall semester.

As the official executive vice president, provost and chief operating officer, Berkman is now the University's second-in-command.

With his position finally guaranteed, Berkman plans to focus on issues such as the College of Medicine.

 "Great progress has been made with the College of Medicine and I have high standards of progress," Berkman said in an interview with The Beacon.

The provost said that the immediate objectives for the college include finalizing a curriculum and preparing for provisional accreditation. Talks are also underway to establish partnerships with major local hospitals, such as Jackson and Baptist.

Berkman also confirmed that there is currently no replacement donor for the college's naming rights.

Dr. Herbert Wertheim, the college's former donor, retracted a $20 million gift last semester and requested that the college not carry his name as had originally been planned following a highly-publicized squabble with Maidique.

Also of concern were the results of a report publicized Jan. 18 that said Florida's university system could go bankrupt if it did not properly plan for an expected surge in statewide college attendance.

The report was discussed Jan. 24 and 25 by the BOG. The Beacon reported that a key recommendation mentioned was that Florida organize its universities in a tiered system, similar to a system currently being used in California. This would mean that only two or three universities would be labeled as research institutions while a large number of smaller universities would focus exclusively on undergraduate studies.

"Some of the suggestions [from that report] are good, some are not so good, and some are downright loony," Berkman said. "We are a research university and have made a significant effort to increase graduate enrollment."

Berkman agreed that not all institutions should try to achieve prominence. However, the provost still feels "the report is painted with a broad brush stroke."

Because FIU is located in an urban setting, there are students who come here who need professional degrees for career advancement and master's degrees for their licenses. Focusing solely on undergraduate education would be detrimental, according to Berkman.

"His track record at FIU speaks for itself," Maidique wrote in an e-mail to The Beacon.

Berkman has over 15 years of academic administrative experience, 12 of which were held at FIU.

He began his FIU career in 1997 as dean of the College of Public Affairs and was one of the leaders in spearheading both the law school and medical school initiatives.

As provost, Berkman oversees all academic programs and deans. He is also responsible for student affairs, graduate programs, contracts, grants, research and admissions recruitment.

"[He] will be most active in fund-raising for the academic areas," Maidique wrote.

As chief operating officer, he is involved with FIU's legislative agenda and resource allocations.

There were 26 candidates for the position, according to a University-wide e-mail sent by Maidique Jan. 30. 

Berkman and three other candidates were selected for final interviews, according to Elam.

"The important thing is we're all optimistic about the future of FIU under [Berkman's] leadership," Wilkins said.

Headline: SGC-BBC forum provides answers to student questions
Author: Christina Lemus / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Government Council at Biscayne Bay Campus held their "Got Questions?" forum in Panther Square where they had answered frequently asked questions.

The event took place Jan. 30 and 31 with lots of free food, music, prize give-aways and any information a student might need to get involved.

Christian Jeannot SGC-BBC's chief of staff, specified that the raising of the athletic fee will be addressed on Feb. 7 at the council's next weekly meeting, where they will discuss the impact that the increase will have on students.

Along with the "Got Questions?" forum, Panther Square was the site for the BBC Club Fair. Different clubs, along with SGC-BBC, had information booths set up to inform students of the different clubs on campus and how to get involved.

Clubs for drama, science and the FIU Student Alumni Association were just some of the organizations looking for new members. A more recent club, The Speakeasies underground literary magazine, was looking for creative minds to help jump-start the only underground literary magazine at FIU.

SGC-BBC also offered information on a new event called "In the Zone Tournament" which kicked off on the second day of the forum with a ping-pong tournament.  Future events will include other BBC sports such as tennis, basketball, volleyball, soccer and swimming. 

Both events appealed to students such as Adaugo Nnadi as many walked by on their way to class, partaking in free pizza and information.

 "I found it very informative, especially being a new student on campus. I think it's very important to get involved," said Nnadi, a senior and transfer student to the campus.

Nnadi was particularly interested in the "Got Questions?" forum, which made people aware to opening positions on the council staff.

Such positions include graduate representative, student union board, parliamentarian and Campus Life chair.

Requirements to get involve in SGC-BBC include a 3.0 GPA, 50% of classes must be taken on Biscayne Bay campus and must attend the Wednesday meetings.

Nnadi is hoping to attend the next SGC-BBC meeting.

"The students need to know we are here for them. We want students to be active [on campus] and come to us with their concerns. SGC-BBC is simply students working for students," said Daniela Ottati, sophomore and special events director for the council.

Headline: Review: Of Montreal - Hissing Fauna, Are You There Destroyer? (Music)
Author: Reinier Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Georgia-based band Of Montreal emerged in the late '90s as a typical lo-fi indie group with a strong sense for pop sensibilities. Over the years, the group has evolved their sound significantly, with the inclusion of psychedelic, music hall and even vaudevillian instrumentation appearing on their albums. Their recent releases have taken them in a decidedly electronic direction, and their latest Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? continues the trend.

Front-man and primary songwriter Kevin Barnes has varied both the instrumentation and his approach to lyrics throughout Of Montreal's career. He began writing conventional pop songs about relationships and love before moving to more narrative lyrics, usually using a separate character to tell the story. However, with Hissing Fauna, Barnes' lyrics have become wholly personal and particularly dark. 

Barnes secluded himself in Norway while writing the album as he describes, "on the verge of a total breakdown," and on the song "Cato as a Pun" he sings about isolating himself from society: "I guess you just want to shave your head/ Have a drink and be left alone" before the music completely stops and he whispers wearily, "Is that too much to ask?" Barnes also tackles the issue of his own fame and dissatisfaction with it on the song "Gronlandic Edit," where he sings "All the party people dancing for the indie star/ But he's the worst faker by far."

However -and this is key to Of Montreal's appeal- Barnes is able to combine generally depressing lyrics with upbeat, almost bubbly music. One of the most surreal moments I had while listening to the album was bobbing my head and singing along loudly with a huge smile on my face to the song "Heimdalsgate like a Promethean Curse."

The premise of the song deals with chemical dependence, a very real and dangerous problem, and the lyrics reflect this. But the chorus consists of Barnes singing "c'mon chemicals!" over and over and, while I recognized that this must have been a painful experience for Barnes, the music it's set to is so happy, you can't help but sing along.

The rest of the album is no less dichotomous and adventurous for the band known for their catchy hooks and melodies. Along with the usual pop offerings, we get an experimental, electronic epic with "The Past is a Grotesque Animal" clocking in at almost 12 minutes and the wonderfully funky "Faberge Falls for Shuggie" is another gem uncharacteristic of the band. 

While this album is definitely a departure for the group, there's so much musical diversity here while still maintaining the characteristics that made the band great in the first place that both old fans and new listeners can find something to love.

Headline: Review: Little Saigon - 16752 North Miami Avenue (Food)
Author: Lalinda De La fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Vietnamese food in Miami exists in two forms: expensive fancy restaurants and tiny little joints.  Either way, one can experience good Vietnamese fare. However, few offer good fare with an enjoyable authenticity such as Little Saigon in North Miami Beach.

Little Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant lies unimpressively to the side of a gas station off Miami Beach Boulevard and isn't much of a restaurant to brag about ­- the décor is practically nonexistent while the wait staff is few and far between.

No matter, because Little Saigon stands as an exception to other small restaurants, competing for patron's dollars. The one waitress moves quickly enough while the menu is extensive and the food is satisfying.

Little Saigon offers a wide array of food.  For those who are adventurous, pig's feet and ears can be enjoyed. For the more timid eater, there are just as many more sound culinary choices.

The sizzling crepe is an appetizer favorite. Reminiscent of the French influence that Vietnamese culture has, this dish is an omelet-like crepe stuffed with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts.

Summer rolls are always an appetizing choice: stuffed with pork, shrimp or both and a range of fresh vegetables.  Edamame, or boiled soybeans, is an appetizer that is surprisingly both tasty and good for you. It has been found by the Food and Drug Administration to help fight heart disease and cancer.

 Although all Vietnamese restaurants have basics like fried rice and stir-frys, the classic dishes to try are their huge noodle soups. You can choose from rice or egg noodles and any type of meat ranging from beef to seafood.

A large dish of vegetables from fresh mint to bean sprouts and fresh jalapenos is brought to your table as additions to your soup. There are also several sauces that range from sweet to spicy. Each soup can essentially be perfectly catered to your taste buds.

These soups are large so if you don't like large portions, one of these soups can be shared; the restaurant will be happy to bring you two smaller bowls.

Asian restaurants have a wonderful way of having dishes that double as desserts and pick-me-ups. Vietnamese coffee can either be served hot or cold. Usually made with a French roast, this coffee is sweetened with condensed milk. Carefully brewed, the coffee is made stronger while the condensed milk gives it a dessert-like sweetness that sugar alone could never do.

Little Saigon may seem like nothing more than a small joint, but the authentic, flavorful food, friendly service and Vietnamese women diligently cooking in the kitchen makes this eatery a fun and inexpensive experience.



The Beacon did not pay for the reviewer's food. Restaurant had no previous knowledge of reviewer's presence.

Headline: Program gives incentive for on-campus dining
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Eating on campus may have gotten a little sweeter with the new Jam Rewards system that went into action during Fall 2006.

The Jam system works this way: you buy food on campus and swipe your Jam Rewards card. With each dollar spent, you accumulate points that can be traded on www.jamrewards.com for cool prizes or as donations to various charities. But the only valid purchases are those made at Aramark-owned locations such as Burger King and Subway, so transactions at places such as Panther Stop or Starbucks don't count.

Basically when using cash or your credit/debit card you earn 10 points per dollar spent and the points are accredited to your Jam Rewards account immediately. If you buy a voluntary meal plan, the same rate applies and the points are accredited within a month. But if you're unlucky and have to buy a mandatory meal plan, you only receive one point per dollar. Jam Rewards will credit back to you those nine missing points per dollar spent if you decide to buy a voluntary meal plan during the next academic semester. Anyone with a valid Panther ID can sign up for the Jam card at its website.

Points don't expire either. So rather then waste your points on a measly headband, you could save them up for a new iPod (though that could take you a while, as an iPod will cost you 93,665 points).

 "The system is to get students to dine with us and get rewarded for it," said Ximena Cordero, the marketing manager for Panther Dining. "It's a great program and we're very excited about it."

It sounds simple enough, but if you've tried using the Jam card this semester, you may have noticed some kinks.

"We've had some problems with the system," Cordero said. "It's in the beginning stages, but it's going to pick up next semester." 

Chief among the problems with Jam Rewards is the lack of student knowledge about the rewards system. Cordero attributes this to the fact that Panther Dining has not yet started its complete advertising campaign for the rewards.

In addition to students not knowing about Jam, many cashiers are also unaware of its usage. 

"They came in and explained to us how to use [the Jam Reward system]," said Veronica Sanchez, a cashier at Gracie's Grill. "But I don't use it." 

"We were waiting to do another complete training session after all of our venues were completed," Cordero said. 

On Feb. 2 there was a training session for Aramark cashiers on how to use the Jam system.

Despite the setbacks, the Jam Rewards system looks like it could really catch on, based on student reactions to hearing about it for the first time.

"I had no idea it existed," said sophomore Elyse Coleman. "But I'm going to check it out."

Though for Coleman, who lives on campus, activating her Jam account is a little more difficult than it may be for those who do not have an existing meal plan. This is because those who signed up for meal plans are automatically signed up for the Jam Rewards system. 

According to Cordero, there are currently 1,400 people enrolled in the Jam Rewards Program.

Headline: How to...a humor column: Spring calls for attempt at Godliness
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
I'm an accidental pack rat. Over the course of moving to bigger locations and having more space to fill, I've established an archive of my life: sheet music, old newspapers and a still fully-decorated plastic Christmas tree - from 2004. I call it "hermit crab syndrome." There's no reason for this chaos, just that, like many other college kids, the only time you have in your room is to change clothes, eat, put down today's crap and pick up some for tomorrow.

While spring doesn't officially start until March, the Spring semester has, which means it's the perfect time to embark on the truly self affirming experience that is spring cleaning. Some say cleanliness is next to Godliness. This guide will focus on getting friendly with the bathrobe-wearing, bearded dude upstairs. Let's get ready to Roomba. 



Memory Deleted



Hindsight is a great way to discern what stays and what goes. Is the napkin from your high school's 2003 homecoming really useful? As I remember, you were holding back your friend's hair as she worshipped the porcelain throne after she lost her first fight with Jose Cuervo. Honestly, I think that's a memory worth deleting.

Anything that's from a past relationship, especially if it ended badly, is also fair game to get rid of. 

You don't have to deny that the giant purple alligator he won for you at the fair is cute, but it doesn't make up for the fact that you paid his way in, plus the $30 worth of baseballs it took him to dunk that loud mouth clown.

The other day I found 12 blue ribbons for winning various elementary school sports "championships." 

As I recall, I was the first person out and the last person picked to play dodgeball. I got rid of them just so as a crazy old lady I wouldn't spread legends of our family's propensity toward sports. It would be a hard fall from that pedestal. I can still recall the precise sound of an inflated rubber ball hitting a 9-year-old's thigh.



Paper work



Sometimes in the process of cleaning, you'll find shrines to things you didn't know you worshipped. Apparently I'm a devout reader of literature from the FIU Department of Traffic and Parking. 

I also am a big fan of the prolific works of the Washington Mutual overdraft agency and Cingular's final notices. Who says I don't read for pleasure?  

Seriously though, as a fan of keeping trees around, an easy and socially inevitable way to alleviate the mess is online banking and bill paying. 

I'm trying to get my mom on board, but she's still not comfortable with the idea of an ATM card. (This is actually true).

Old textbooks (the ones you couldn't sell back) and high-school required reading are a huge bulk you could either get rid of or donate. Reference sections are for the library, not your makeshift-stack-of-crates-bookshelf. 

I know you spent $120 on a chemistry book, but if your major is creative writing, I think you're safe to get rid of it.



A word on clothes



You're not going to fit into those pants again. Deal with it. 



Sweet freedom



 Some say an absence of clutter allows the mind to clear. Not to mention, you feel more relaxed and at home in your surroundings. 

No one says there's no room for nostalgia. Keep things like old notes, journals, birthday cards, etc. Just don't overdo it. Holding on to old crap both physically and mentally holds you back from getting new … crap. And nobody wants that. Good luck.

Headline: ULLIEL RISING: Up and coming actor fills big jaws with Hannibal prequel
Author: Chris Cabral / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
French actor Gaspard Ulliel stars as a young Hannibal Lecter in the upcoming film Hannibal Rising, which details the notorious cannibal's youth. In this prequel, Ulliel replaces Anthony Hopkins, who played Hannibal in The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon.

The movie is being released in theaters Feb. 9.

Ulliel sat down for a round-table interview with college reporters to talk about the movie and his transition into English-language films.



Q: What was it like playing such an iconic character as Hannibal Lecter? 

It was a bit scary of course because [I'm] coming after an actor like Anthony Hopkins and being a French actor and everything.  But once I was acting for two hours or so it became very addictive and I enjoyed it.



Q: Did you feel you had to be loyal to Anthony Hopkins' interpretation of the character?

Obviously I knew a lot of people would be looking for similarities to Anthony Hopkins' version but we talked a lot about this with the director and we agreed that this is a different character. He is a little more na've and much younger so I was more free to create my own character.



Q: Where did you find the humanity?

First of all, it was a nice script, and reading it, we could see that this character is just a kid. He is more human than in the other films … so I was able to make him more like me; give him more of a human touch.



Q: What sort of process did you put yourself through to prepare for this role?

I watched all the films again and I read all the novels. And what really helped were these interesting readings about real killers, interviews with them saying why they killed and that was very helpful for me. I worked a lot with Peter Weber [the director of Hannibal Rising] and we had meetings with a movement coach to sort of learn how the character would move, how he would breathe. And finally, Peter sent me to a medical school in Prague to watch autopsies and that was important because Hannibal spends every day in medical school in this film.



Q: What was it like working with Gong Li, who previously appeared in Miami Vice and Memoirs of a Geisha?

Well I think working with her was great. She is very pretty you know, and when you meet her you can see that she is very fun and cheerful and easy [going].

As an actor she is very generous, she gives a lot. And she has a very Asian way of working, very precise and focused and that helps.



Q: What was it like making the transition to an English-language film?

It was not very easy and I was a bit anxious about it. I had one accent coach and he worked with me. Obviously when you are working in another language it means additional work on the set every day. You have to try to make the dialogue sound natural. You're really not as free as when you work in your own language. Like in English there are certain intonations that are different in English than in French. 



Q: Where do you go from here, do you want to be in more English and American films, and if so, which directors would you like to work with?

This is a job where you don't really know what's going to happen tomorrow. 

So I won't say, 'I hope this gets me more offers.' I would like to work in American films.

There are a lot of very talented people. But I love French cinema, too. 



Q: Thomas Harris received criticism for writing the book and the screenplay for this film simultaneously and some say that making a prequel takes away some of the character's mystery. How do you respond to that?

I think some people are complaining about making a prequel because they feel it takes away the mystery but, you know, it's up to Thomas Harris [the author of Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Red Dragon].

He is like Hannibal's father and he can do what he wants with him.

I thought the script was very interesting and if you have three books already about him it might be good to explain the past of the character.



Q: How does this compare to your other films?

Working in English was very different and way more tiring in a way.

This was the first time I worked 12 hours a day. In France we are a little bit lazy and we work only 8 hours a day. It was also way more daunting and challenging working on such an iconic role. I'm nearly in every scene and there's a lot more pressure playing such an iconic role. This is the first time I've been very anxious and frightened about the opening of a film.



Q: How was it working with Peter Weber?

It was great. The producers met me first and then they presented me to Peter in Paris. We met and I could see that he was very welcoming, cool and nice.

He really wanted to do the film and had an idea about what to do with it and that was very reassuring. After that I saw Girl with a Pearl Earring and I was seduced by this small film. In our second meeting we had auditions and I liked the way he worked with me. He gives his actors a lot of freedom and he lets us suggest things and he was always available for his actors.



Q: Do you sympathize more with Hannibal now that you've made this film?

In this film we can see how everything started and [that] he is not as evil as you might think. He's just a kid who drifted away from reality. It always [seemed] strange to me why the audience [was] always seduced by him, even when he was a real serial killer. I think it's because he is a mixture of all the worst and best aspects of a human being. He is a killer, who is a little perverted, a little bit insane. But he is also talented and witty and smart and really very charming.



Q: How many weeks did it take you to shoot this film?

It was shot in Prague. It was freezing cold most of the time and it took a long time; three months and a half, six days a week and I was there most days.



Q: Are you a horror fan? How does this film compare to the others?

I'm not a big horror fan, but it's a nice thing to be frightened in the cinema.

We are sensation-seeking creatures.

This film is different. It's in a different country, in a different period, more of a human aspect to Hannibal. It's less of a psychological thriller. It's more gory, has more action scenes, I guess.

Headline: New website on its way to BBC
Author: Carla St. Louis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When Damina Fernandez was appointed the new vice provost for the Biscayne Bay Campus last year, he made it known that renovating the campus' webpage would be part of a new initiative campaign to refresh BBC.

According to the official website's page, "A new and improved BBC website is currently under construction." 

The website's renovation could not have been more appropriate, considering FIU students are still frustrated with its inconsistencies and appearance.

 "The most frustrating aspect of the BBC website is the fact that it's so inefficient," said Siedah-Michelle Bodie, a sophomore majoring in nursing.

Established in 2004, the webpage, which supplies limited information, served as a liaison between BBC-based establishments such as the Kovens Center, Honors College and the Wolfe University Center.

Its address was www.fiu.edu/~bbc/.

According to Frances Spiegel, program coordinator of the Cuban Research Institute, the previous BBC webpage wasn't serving the purpose of a campus website.

 "We felt that the current BBC-website was not what we wanted to offer students," Spiegel said. "That's why we established a contract with Studio of Digital Arts in order to renovate the site."

These issues were also a great concern to Fernandez.

"It wasn't user-friendly, and we wanted it to be accessible," Fernandez said.

Spiegel and Studio of Digital Arts performed a field test in which students were asked to reveal their expectations from the site. 

The Studio of Digital Arts used the responses in order to create a simulated webpage. The mock site can be viewed at www.bbc.fiu.edu/.

"Students can expect the newly renovated BBC webpage to be user-friendly and attractive," Spiegel said. 

The webpage isn't the only BBC-centered site. Another website, www.wuc.fiu.edu, also caters to BBC. 

"Our webpage was initially launched for the main purpose of communicating with students and the rest of the world." said Camilo A. Silva, president of the Student Government Council at BBC.

Despite the council-created webpage, www.wuc.fiu.edu, having been registered for an extended time, its revision began recently.

 "Our SGA website was created a long time ago, although it was never updated-just until now," Silva said.

BBC's webpage, www.wuc.fiu.edu, provides a stark contrast to the original.

Current announcements and hourly scheduling of BBC events ranging from lectures, recreational activities and health awareness can be viewed at this site.

Upcoming BBC events are also listed, along with such links to a message board and student and campus-based websites.

When the issue of two websites servicing BBC students was declared, mixed responses followed. 

 "The fact that there are two different websites that cater to BBC is confusing," said junior Etania Simmonds.

Junior Kimberly Flakes suggested a merge between the University websites.

 "As opposed to making the websites separate, they should merge and provide BBC students with as much resources as [University Park's] website," Flakes said.

Based on the website's lack of resources, many students argue that the renovations will not change the contrast of BBC's website, compared to FIU's main webpage,

"I doubt that the website will improve, or even be on the same standard as UP's [website]," said Kameelah Rahaman, a senior and Bay Vista Housing Resident Assistant.

However, committee that is working towards the webpage's advancement disagrees.

"Since BBC is entering a new era," Spiegel said, "we wanted the main website to reflect a fresher look."

Headline: V.P. position filled with familiar face
Author: Ana Davis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a poised yet calm demeanor, Brent Maximin, former director of student lobbying, accepted the position of vice president of the Student Government Council at the Biscayne Bay Campus for a second time. 

The appointment was confirmed at the council's weekly meeting Jan. 31.

Immediately after the announcement was made, Maximin took the empty seat beside SGC-BBC president Camilo Silva officially assuming his role as second-in-command.

In a strange case of poetic justice, Maximin's career in SGC-BBC has come full circle.  

He began as a freshman, serving as director of student lobbying at BBC and the next year ran and won the position of vice president.

Following that term, he ran for vice president again, losing by only seven votes to Pamela St. Fleur.

However, Maximin returned as director of student lobbying after being appointed by Silva.

"I was disappointed, obviously [after losing the election]. But it worked out as I was able to join SGA [anyway]," Maximin said. 

 "[Maximin] is well fitted for the position. We need someone who will take care of business," Silva said.

According to Gabriel Labrador, representative-at-large, one of the main reasons Maximin was considered again was due to his previous experience.

"Having experienced members in the University-wide Council will give the SGC-BBC better opportunities to negotiate with their counterparts in [University Park]," Labrador said.

Zach Trautenberg, comptroller and finance chair, also nominated Maximin for the job and strongly supported him.

Though some members said they believe Maximin already had his chance at vice presidency and lost, Trautenberg disagrees.

"[Maximin] lost the vice president position by seven votes. The students want him," he said. 

"It's also good to a have a psychology major in the council."

He also stressed the importance of electing a vice president who has experience with the University-wide Council budget meetings to represent the interest of BBC students.

The budget meetings determine the amount of money allocated to each part of SGA.

According to SGA's constitution, when a vacancy occurs in the vice president position, elections must be scheduled to fill it.

The elections and the announcement took place the same day and during the same meeting; however, they did not include the student body. 

Members were also allowed to nominate themselves for the position if they felt they were capable of the responsibility.

Nonetheless, the only students eligible to vote were representatives that made up the legislative branch of SGC-BBC.

"You have to know what you are getting into. This is one of the most important positions of SGA," Silva said. 

Rafael Zapata, assistant director of Campus Life, encouraged Silva to read the credentials necessary to take on the job of vice president to stress the importance vice presidency.

"In case Camilo were to resign or leave, this person will have to take over for him," Zapata said.

Maximin ran against Wes Wells, technology advancement director, and Katiana Saintable, representative-at-large, who were also nominated.

Both Wells and Saintable warmly congratulated Maximin after hearing the results as the rest of the council clapped, expressing their approval. 

"This position is difficult to come into one month into the semester. I already have experience. It will be my priority to work with [Silva] to continue what he and Pamela started," Maximin said.

Maximin will serve in the position until the elections that will take place this semester.

"I'm excited to be back in the position and to receive the confidence from the council," he said.

"This is less about me as an individual, it is about what is best for the council," Maximin said.
