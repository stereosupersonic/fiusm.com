Headline: Class schedule format may change
Author: Jackie Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The University class schedule that many are used to may no longer be put into practice after a proposal submitted by the Classroom Utilization Committee last Spring semester. 

The Florida Board of Governors is concerned with how efficiently universities utilize their space, which includes classrooms and laboratories. 

Universities with low utilization rates will be denied state funds for construction. 

FIU has the lowest utilization rate in Florida. This will directly impact any plans the school has in the future. 

"This does not only affect classrooms but the construction of research labs and the new College of Medicine," said Bruce Hauptli, faculty chairman and professor in the department of philosophy. 

For this reason, Hauptli and Ronald Berkman, interim provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs, formed the Classroom Utilization Committee. It hopes to identify strategies, policies, and practices that will improve utilization and position FIU for future growth in its students and programs. 

The report recommends FIU adopt a schedule that will increase classroom space usage 

A three day schedule during the daytime on Monday, Wednesday and Friday with 50 minute time blocks would replace the current two day schedule with 75 minute time blocks on Monday and Wednesday. Tuesday, Thursday classes will remain the same. 

The Faculty Senate will vote on the report early in the Fall semester where it is expected to be approved. However, it will not take affect until Fall 2007.

"I prefer to have all of my classes at an hour and 15 minutes only twice a week," junior Joshua Gomez said. "Given the circumstances it might be the only thing to do." 

 The average full-time undergraduate student makes four trips to campus per week, according to research conducted by the committee. Having a three day schedule will gain 2,227 new class meetings per week due to more time block availability, reducing the amount of trips made to the university. 

FIU is one of the only universities in Florida that has a two day schedule.

The committee also hopes FIU will develop and publish an annual schedule for its classes rather than scheduling on a term by term basis. 

"Students deserve predictability, having an annual schedule can make their life work around that," Berkman said. 

Berkman explained that the committee was inspired to help students. They want to create a pattern that will help students move toward their degree faster. 

"That's how we lose students, no flexibility," he added. 

Some faculty members are proposing another alternative. The mathematics department has been using an alternate two day schedule for about three years, which conduct classes on Monday, Friday; Monday, Wednesday and/or Wednesday, Friday. 

"Many other models would work to utilize Fridays without changing the entire University schedule," Dev Roy, professor in the department of mathematics said. "When faculty has a 2-day teaching schedule it allows them to use the remaining three days of the work week for research, seminars, collective departmental governance, etc." 

Student Amy Wint, agrees.

"I would prefer longer hours with shorter days then shorter classes with more days. It's just not practical or convenient, with gas prices rising and juggling a full time, work and school schedule". 

According to Hauptli, the most effective way to be heard is to reach the Student Government Association on each campus or to send comments to the committee. 

"Now is the time to provide input in a decision that would impact the way we do things for a long period of time," he said.

Headline: SGA to hold campus involvement event
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Asst. BBC Editor
&nbsp;
As Independence Day approaches, the members of the Student Government Association at Biscayne Bay Campus are not focusing on fireworks or barbeques. Instead they are preparing for its "Got Questions?" event scheduled for July 5-6 between 11:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. in Panther Square at the Wolf University Center.

Held every semester to promote student awareness and involvement in the various activites and services the campus has to offer, "Got Questions?" is being prepared with a special twist this time around.

"We have invited University Park along with its different departments and clubs to join us for this event and they have accepted, said Elizabeth Cervantes Director of Public Relations for SGA at BBC. "Students that travel to UP for one or two classes don't get to see all that the campus has to offer and they miss their chance to get involved in any extracurricular activity." 

Greek Organizations such as Sigma Sigma Sigma and Beta Theta Pi along with P.E.A.C.E, a volunteer organization that promotes diversity, will be attending the event. However other clubs, organizations and department services from both campuses will be there to promote as well.

"A lot of students don't have a clue about the things both campuses have to offer," Izaguirre said. "This will be a good opportunity for organizations to invite students to learn more about them and for students to know what's going on."

Besides having University administrators present, SGA has arranged for the appearance of a celebrity on both days. Reluctant to reveal the identity of the individual, Cervantes said it will be a surprise for students and that the celebrity, an FIU alumnus, is a living testimony of campus involvement.

Free food including sandwiches, chicken wings, pizza, chips and soda will be served at the event. According to Izaguirre, dance competitions and games similar to Jeopardy will also be held.

The action packed event isn't all SGA will offer to BBC students on July 5. With a new cafeteria being built elsewhere on campus, the administration at FIU has proposed to use the space of the current cafeteria for a classroom, a proposal that has many students concerned because of the noise from WUC.

"As a student I can imagine sitting down, getting ready to take a test and suddenly hearing the blast from speakers downstairs," said Steven Ramirez, journalism representative for SGA at BBC.

As a result, SGA will be holding an open forum at 3:30 p.m. to discuss the issue including other possibilities for the space such as an activity room for students and the expansion of campus life offices. FIU administrators will be present to hear the discussions.

"It's important for students to come out and voice their opinions so when the time comes for the administrators to make their final decision, they will take into account the opinions of students and not just the opinions of SGA," Cervantes said. 

"We're expecting a big crowd on July 5 for the "Got Questions?" event so we believe there will be a higher chance of having more students present at the open forum that day."

Headline: Marine Sciences building opened
Author: Fallan M Thompson /  Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Throughout the course of 15 years, Joel Trexler has watched FIU evolve as a major university. Now he can be part of a new chapter in the history of FIU. The $10 million state-of-the-art marine biology building located at the Biscayne Bay Campus opened earlier this summer.

"Getting a new building is pretty amazing," Trexler said, interim director of the program. "It's designed for marine scientists."

The building has a prime location next to Biscayne Bay and boasts one wet lab with tanks and water tables, 10 research labs, three teaching labs that seat 24 students and a large teaching lab that accommodates 50 students. 

The building, at 57,000 square feet, is also hooked up to receive fresh sea water to each lab. Furniture will be delivered and set up soon. 

"The building was scheduled to open last January but due to construction delays, the opening has been pushed back to this summer for faculty," Trexler said. "Students can use it in the fall." 

Currently, the building is called the Marine Sciences Building, But the name is up in the air for donators. There are no donors yet.

FIU began to explore the possibility of a marine biology degree 10 years ago. About six years ago, FIU made the decision and began to receive state funding and hired Dr. Chris Brown as program director. 

Because of the new building, several new faculty members have been hired to help jumpstart the program. 

Program directors are also looking into expanding the program to include oceanography and a graduate program geared toward marine biology. 

Other projects include a Summer Marine Institute with the North Miami Beach High School Science Magnet Program, during the Summer B semester. This program allows advanced high school science students to take lower division university courses using the Dual Enrollment program.

Shortly after becoming an accredited degree program in October 2001, Marine Biology, upon approval by the Curriculum Committee, added  Marine Microbial Ecology and Endocrinology as courses.

According to FIU'S marine biology website, there are currently 107 registered marine biology majors, but Dr. Brown believes there will be more in the Fall semester.

"I am proud of the program because it is rigorous," Trexler said. "Students can't slip through the cracks because of the difficulty of the classes."

FIU:
SoBe Wine & Food Festival partners up

The South Beach Wine & Food Festival's founder and director Lee Brian Schrager signed the Food Network as title sponsor. 

The 2007 edition will be featured as the Food Network South Beach Wine & Food Festival presented by Food & Wine magazine and hosted by Southern Wine & Spirits and FIU.

The partnership lists Food Network stars  such as Michael Chiarello, Bobby Flay, Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray on the Feb. 23-25 roster.

Tickets for the festival, which benefits the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, go on sale in October at sobewineandfoodfest.com.


LOCAL:
Poll says: Crist may win gobernatorial seat

A survey from Quinnipiac University shows Charlie Crist, Florida's attorney general, would defeat GOP rival Tom Gallagher, the state's chief financial officer, for the Republican party's governor nomination with a 49-21 margin. That would equal a six percentage-point gain for Crist and a five-point loss for Gallagher from a similar survey the Connecticut-based institute conducted last month.

Crist's surge may be largely attributed to television commercials. Crist, unlike Gallagher, has begun airing commercials in many media markets, excluding the Miami, Fort Lauderdale and the Keys.

The poll also showed that public support in Florida remains strong for Gov. Jeb Bush, and weak for President Bush.

The margin of error for the questions asked of the 1,311 people was 2.7 percent and was 4.3 percent for the questions asked of the 520 Republicans and the 528 Democrats who were surveyed.

Judge to rule on book ban

A series of children's books banned this month by the Miami-Dade School Board must stay in the district until a federal judge holds a preliminary hearing July 21.

Copies of Vamos a Cuba and 23 other titles in the same series will remain in school libraries, according to School Board attorney Luis Garcia. U.S. District Judge Alan Gold. 

He did not specify whether the books need to remain on shelves and accessible to students. 

The decision came after a months-long debate over the books began when the father of a Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary student complained Vamos a Cuba contained inaccuracies that left an unreasonably mild portrait of life under Fidel Castro.


NATIONAL:
Supreme Court rules military tribunals illegal

In a 5-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court found President Bush surpassed his authority by creating military tribunals for prisoners at the Guantánamo Bay detention center.

Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the ruling. He said the proposed trials violate U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions, signed by the United States in the aftermath of World War II.

The decision does not specify whether the controversial camps should be shut down. It only addresses whether the administration can pursue plans to try the detainees by military tribunals.

President Bush said he is willing to work with Congress to find a way to try the detainees before military tribunals. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jon Kyl of Arizona, who back Military Commissions, suggested they're willing to support Bush's effort.

Headline: University gets back onboard transit plan
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Amidst controversy, the University has cleared up its stance on a proposed Metrorail station to be built at University Park.

Interim Provost Ronald Berkman told The Beacon that he and President Modesto A. Maidique are "enthusiastic about having a station on campus."

This stance is different from the one FIU Spokeswoman Maydel Santana-Bravo gave The Miami Herald two weeks ago when she said FIU supported building an off-campus Metrorail station at Tamiami Park rather than at UP because it "wouldn't take up precious campus real estate."

"I think it was a misunderstanding," Berkman said. "[Santana-Bravo's] quote was a real estate issue and that is not really a question. The question is that we have to be concerned with the campus footprint."

There are three sites along the west edge of UP near the Turnpike and National Hurricane Center that have to be further looked at for the proposed site, according to Berkman.

This site would be the west station of a 10.4-mile east-west corridor that would roughly follow the Dolphin Expressway. It would link FIU out west and the Miami Intermodal Center next to the airport on the east.

Even though FIU is now onboard, the proposal has yet to be approved.

"It is not clear whether this will ever happen and if it did, it probably won't happen for at least the next 10 to 12 years," Berkman said.

If approved, the Metrorail station would alleviate traffic at UP, where currently over 90 percent of the students enrolled live off-campus. 

"Our most ambitious plan ever had 15 percent of the student body living on campus so we will always have a huge commuter population," Berkman said. "We need to diminish the use of cars."

Miami-Dade Transit will submit plans to county commissioners by the end of the year to seek federal government approval over the next two years.

Headline: Clubs complement college life
Author: Maria Chercoles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There is no better way to go through the transition from high school to college than by getting involved in one of the many clubs and organizations the University has to offer. 
By supporting these organizations, the Department of Campus Life challenges the belief that college is all about studying. There are different options depending on your interests. 

Student Programming Council

One of the more hands on organizations is the Student Programming Council, where you'll help organize events such as concerts, movie screenings, comedy shows and week long cultural events like Hispanic Heritage Week. 
"SPC is dedicated to programming events by the students for the students," said junior Janette Francois, SPC president at Biscayne Bay campus. "SPC helps you develop your communication and leadership skills, and you also get to meet famous people like actors and comedians." 
For more information, go to SPC at Graham Center 2304 or Wolfe University Center 141C

Greek Life

There are currently 28 fraternities - each with its own history, characteristics and requirements, making Greek life one of the most active campus life sections. Members must attend meetings, plan social events, and participate in activities such as community service and educational programs. 
"Being Greek gives you the extra push to get involved on campus," said junior Marbely Hernandez, a member of Alpha Xi Delta Fraternity. "With such a support group, you have the extra confidence to make a name for yourself at FIU and develop your strengths."
 Fraternities and sororities are committed to the overall development of their members by encompassing academic, athletic and personal enhancement. 
Another advantage of joining Greek Life is the lifelong friends you'll make. For more information, go to GC 2247.

Student Government Association

SGA is the student government body responsible for representing students' interests and addressing students' needs on matters of University, county and state concern. It's the link between the University and the students. 
"SGA is the heart and soul of FIU," said SGA Intern Coordinator Christine Mendez. "The organization provides students with leadership opportunities and the chance to have an impact in University decision-making." Mendez said.
In SGA, you can be active in student affairs and university policies whether you are the President or just a regular member. SGA is also one of the best places to get leadership, networking and organizational experience. For more information, go to GC 211 or WUC 141.

FIU's Radio Station Radiate 88.1

"At 88.1 Radiate, it's all about music and about getting involved in the community through music," said Brennan Forsythe, Radiate 88.1 General Manager. 
If you love music, you might want to become part of FIU's radio station. This is a great opportunity to meet people who share your music taste. 
"This is one of the most unique organizations on campus," Forsythe said.
Positions include engineering, promotions, DJ's, sports broadcasting and news reporting.
To apply you just need to download an application from wrgp.fiu.edu or www.myspace.com/radiateFM.

Student Organizations Council 

If you are not sure about what organization is the best for you, the Student Organizations Council is the right place to look. SOC is the council governing over 100 registered clubs, which range from political to cultural/social interests.
"Most clubs have no major requirements, making it easy for anyone to join. Although they may have certain affinity, the policy is to welcome anyone," said FIU alumni and Student Assistant for Campus Life Larissa Adames. "One of the most popular clubs is the International Student Club, and although most of its members are international students, anyone interested in foreign cultures can join."   
However, if none of these organizations catch your interest, you can start your own under the guidance of SOC. It is not as complicated as it seems, and it is the best way to meet people who share your particular interests. SOC will be having a Club Fair on July 27 at BBC, but if you can't wait, you can get a list of current clubs by visiting SOC's office in GC 2300 or WUC 141. 

Few more words on Campus Life

If you are still not sure about what organization to join, stop by Campus Life located at GC 2240. You may also check their website at www.fiu.edu/%7Ecamplife/.
"We are here to help students find what interests them. We operate as a link between SGA, SPC and SOC, so we are the place to start in order to get involved at FIU," explained Sarah David, Office Manager and Advisor of Campus Life.
Even if you are not a new student at FIU, it's never too late to become part of Campus Life and make your college years a unique experience.

Headline: Superman returns as a colossal disappointment
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director 
&nbsp;
It's a bird! It's a plane! It's lame! Yes, despite all the media hype surrounding Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, the end result is an empty blockbuster that keeps going, and going, and going like the Energizer bunny. Clocking in at almost two hours and forty minutes, Superman Returns feels like four hours.

The plot is fairly simplistic. Superman (Brandon Routh) has returned after nearly five years of searching for survivors on Krypton, his home planet.

The world has moved on and nearly forgotten about him including Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who has moved on with her life as she now has a child and a new boyfriend, Richard White (James Marsden a.k.a. Cyclops from X-Men). 

Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who is out of prison because Superman wasn't there to testify at his trial, is scheming to yet again to take over the world, thus ruining the lives of billions. Cue John William's classic theme, and it looks like a time for Superman!

The biggest problem with the film is the direction. Superman Returns tries to be both sequel and homage to the first and second Superman films, but it ends up falling somewhere in the middle with no focus on what it wants to be. 

Singer is obviously a very talented director. His work on The Usual Suspects and X2 should suffice to prove my statement. 

However, you don't go about making a two and a half hour superhero movie with no real conflict, paper-thin villains, hardly any action and a lead that's as charismatic as a log of wood. 

The high point of the movie comes at the hour mark when Superman saves a burning 777 plane from crashing. The scene is exhilarating, intense and what the Superman movies are about. Too bad, since it's all downhill from there as the movie becomes a seemingly endless loop of play and repeat. 

Singer and his cronies shove the "Son of God" references down our throats like a sledgehammer, from Superman falling to Earth in a crucifix pose to his absence for five years, such as Jesus Christ's 40-day disappearance. 

The next big hole in the film is its script, which involves something about Lex Luther trying to create his own continent by using the combination of memory crystals from Superman's fortress and kryptonite. Could it be it any more boring? Didn't Luther attempt to do something of a similar nature in the first film? I've seen more than my share of villains with plans of world domination, but none as inept as Luthor's. 

Spacey is one of the finest actors alive and judging by the trailers, it seemed like he would be the shining point of the film. However, he's reduced to a bumbling criminal in a wasted role. 

His presence in the film is reduced to a sub-plot to make way for the romance between Lois Lane and Superman, which is, I'm sorry to say, poorly handled. 

The pair spends the length of the movie staring at each other, while Superman interrupts their non-existent relationship by flying away to save another falling man, piece of rock, or boat.

Another point to be taken into consideration: Everybody knows Superman's weakness is kryptonite, including Luthor, Lane and Superman himself. You would think Clark Kent would take some type of precautionary measure, right? Nope. He remains naive and still a man wearing blue leotards under his work clothes.

Moving on to the question on everyone's mind: How does Routh do as the man of steel? To say the least, he's serviceable. He's no Christopher Reeves, that's for sure. But once again, the film's script does Routh's mediocre talents no justice, offering him lines ripped off from the original film, which I add, are his only lines. 

Bosworth gives a better performance than Routh.

Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen provides some life into the film every time Routh tries to pull it out, and I have to admit that despite its faults, the film does have some great effects with John Ottoman recycling John William's score enough to make us smile.

End Note: While Superman Returns will reap in money at the box office, the film itself comes as a massive disappointment with one unanswered question still on everybody's mind - How in the world can Superman put on a pair of glasses as Clark Kent and become virtually unrecognizable to everyone? It's just mind blowing stuff.

Headline: Summer Concerts
Subheadline: Summer tours, festivals bring variety of music to South Florida
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
With so many students enjoying their break from school during summer, they will be able to attend the big concerts coming to South Florida this season. Whether you're into rock, pop or hip-hop music, the following concerts will be your best bets for a fun time listening to good music with great friends.


Taking Back Sunday/Angels and Airwaves

Fans of rock bands Taking Back Sunday and Angels and Airwaves will have the opportunity to see both groups perform together at the Pompano Beach Amphitheatre July 12. 

Both bands are touring in support of their latest albums. Taking Back Sunday's music video for their single "MakeDamnSure" off the band's new album Louder Now has been receiving lots of airplay on MTV and MTV2 - so concert attendees can expect to hear that song and other favorites from the group's previous two albums. 

Similarly, Angels and Airwaves is supporting its debut album We Don't Need to Whisper, featuring the hit single "The Adventure," which is being played regularly on the radio and internet music sites. Tickets are available beginning at $27. Bands Head Automatica and The Subways are the opening acts for the show.


Madonna 

Pop goddess Madonna's Confessions Tour will be making two stops in Miami July 22 and 23 in support of her 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor. The tour began in Los Angeles May 21 and has received positive reviews from publications such as the Orange County Register. 

Although a lot of songs off her latest album will be played, fans can still expect classics such as "Like a Virgin" and "Ray of Light" to be performed amidst an extravagant stage show that includes an array of lights and other spectacles. 

While the July 22 show at the AmericanAirlines Arena is already sold out, tickets are still available for the July 23 show. However, fans will have to pay anywhere from $55 to $350 for seats. 


Jurassic 5

Hip-hop group Jurassic 5 releases its new album Feedback July 25. To promote the album, J5 is embarking on a two month tour that will make a stop in Ft. Lauderdale at the Revolution nightclub August 5. 

This is not the first time that the group performs in Ft. Lauderdale - they played at the same nightclub last year. 

Nevertheless, anyone seeing the band on their new tour will hear notable songs from Feedback as well as other albums Quality Control and Power in Numbers. As for opening acts, rap group X-Clan supports J5 throughout the group's tour to promote the latest X-Clan album, Return from Mecca, which will be released in September. Tickets are available for $21 through Ticketmaster.


OZZfest 2006

Coming to the Sound Advice Amphitheatre August 13, Ozzfest 2006 marks the first year that regular headlining act Ozzy Osbourne will not be playing on the festival's main stage. Instead, the rock star will headline the concert's second stage, which is normally reserved for lesser-known rock artists.

Taking Ozzy's place on the main stage is System of a Down, who will be taking an indefinite hiatus following the tour's finish. 

In addition to System of a Down, bands such as Disturbed and Avenged Sevenfold will provide fans with tons of hard rock that will make the mosh pits larger than ever. Ticket prices range from $37 to $95.


Wu-Tang Clan

Hip-hop legend Wu-Tang Clan will perform at the Revolution nightclub in Ft. Lauderdale August 25, the last Friday before the Fall semester begins. 

The show is only for people 18 years old and over, so make sure to have some identification ready. 

For those attending the concert, expect to see the entire original group except for Ol' Dirty Bastard, who passed away in 2004. 

Nevertheless, Wu-Tang Clan will be playing old favorites such as "Bring Da Ruckus" and "Protect Ya Neck." Tickets are currently on sale for $34. Opening acts will be announced soon on Jointherevolution.net, the venue's website.

Headline: Young Marlins current stretch of wins due to low expectations
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Heading into the 2006 season, no one in their right mind expect anything to come from the Florida Marlins - especially after cutting their payroll to an MLB-low $15 million.

And that may be the reason why that team, as of July 1, stands a reachable seven games back from a spot in the National League Wild Card.

In sports, many teams succumb to pressure - mainly due to over-hype and over-exposure. Brazil's recent loss to France in FIFA World Cup is an excellent example. The New York Yankees failure to advance in the postseason since 2000 is yet another. Heck, the Boston Red Sox fell to pressure for 86 years until they finally won the World Series in 2004.

I can write about 100 instances like this in sports - teams that look good on paper, but end up fizzling out of the limelight. But while some get all the attention, other teams don't even get looked at. And sometimes, those teams thrive in that situation.

The Marlins have now become one of those teams. Everyone wrote them off before spring training began, and rightfully so, because any team with a $15 million payroll is destined to fail in the Major Leagues.

And it's not that the people who wrote the team off were harshly negative, because that too can destine a team to failure. It's the fact that nobody even cared about these guys. Why bother being negative about something you're so sure will fail? It would be too cruel.

So these young Marlins, many of whom would still be in AAA and AA if they were on the roster of any other MLB team, are playing without that proverbial monkey on their backs. Something many athletes would kill for - just ask Indianapolis Colts' quarterback Peyton Manning, for one.

Even though the Marlins have the best record in baseball from May 22 to now - going 24-11 in that stretch - people are still not going to expect much from them.

In reality, the Marlins might be playing over their heads and will eventually fizzle out, just like the Washington Nationals did last year, but this stretch has given fans and naysayer alike a glimpse at the future.

Pitchers Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen and Ricky Nolasco are three of the best pitching prospects in the Majors. Put them with young veteran Dontrelle Willis and the can have an All-Star rotation for at least five years.

Shortstop Hanley Ramirez, another highly touted prospect, second baseman Dan Uggla and All-Star third baseman Miguel Cabrera have three-fifths of the infield locked and Jeremy Hermida has right field locked for at least five years as well.

If the team can secure a stadium deal by season's end, there's no doubt the owners will pony up more money in the off-season. If you add more bullpen help, a big-money free agent and a couple of decent veterans with this core of talented, young players and the 2007 Marlins can definitely be contenders.

But not if they're over-hyped.

Headline: After win over Brazil, France is playing its best soccer
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Coming into the World Cup, critics predicted that France's internal problems and squad of aging veterans would prevent the team from making it past the Group Stage.

After France barely earned second place in Group G, critics everywhere predicted the French would lose in the Round of 16 to Spain.

When France routed the Spaniards 3-1, everyone said Brazil, a team that had not lost a World Cup game since 1998, would send the French packing for good.

Now, after France stunned the world with a 1-0 victory over No.1 ranked Brazil, people are finally realizing that this French team is good.

 In fact, it's good enough to win the World Cup like they did in '98.

While the guy on top of me will argue that host teams always perform well during the World Cup, he needs to recognize the difference in this one.

Germany barely got pass Argentina to reach the semifinals even though Argentina's top goal scorers - Juan Roman Riquelme, Hernan Crespo, Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola - were all sitting on the bench during the entire 30 minutes of extra time and penalty kicks.

Not only does France have good players, they have the worlds best.

Zinedine Zidane is a 3-time FIFA Player of the Year, and one of only two players who have won the coveted award three times.

Also on the team is Thierry Henry, one of the best strikers on the planet and star of Arsenal in the English Premiership. In 2003 and 2004, Henry finished second in FIFA Player of the Year voting.

The story of the French team reminds me a lot of the story of the Miami Heat.

Like France, going into the playoffs many critics on ESPN and TNT predicted the Heat wouldn't get pass first round opponent Chicago. Once the Heat did, they said the Heat wouldn't get pass New Jersey. The story went the same when Miami faced Detroit and Dallas.

The similarities don't stop there. Like the Heat's Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade, Zidane and Henry are two key players crucial to France's success. 

Zidane is very much like O'Neal - a star and leading player for much of his career that seeks to add to his legacy with a championship victory.

Henry is the Wade of the team - the player who has emerged as the star and future of the team.

Like the Heat, France has a great supporting class of players who complement Zidane and Henry.

On a list released June 29, 20 World Cup players - including superstars David Beckham, Raul Gonzalez and Riquelme, plus tournament head and former German star player Franz Beckenbauer - picked France's Zidane and Patrick Viera as midfielders to be on the ultimate soccer dream team. Also on the list was French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez who tied with four others at the goalie position.

This is a scary and terrifying fact for the remaining teams in the World Cup. All thee French players (Zidane, Viera and Barthez) will be playing this week. Germany, the team my colleague is picking, had no players on the list. 

France is playing their best soccer now, when it counts. Henry and Zidane, along with Viera - who is a terrific defending midfielder - and Barthez - a steady and confident goalie - will lead France to another World Cup championship.

The Heat proved critics wrong everywhere when they defeated Dallas despite losing the first two games of the 7-game series. Now France will do the same.

Headline: Host country looks to capture the Cup on home soil
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Now that pre-tournament favorites Brazil have been knocked out of the World Cup, Germany, in my opinion, are the top dogs to win the championship and for their nation's fourth World Cup title. Why do I think Jürgen Klinsmann's side has got what it takes to win the cup? Here's why.

Firstly, Germany are the hosts. In the last 17 installments of the World Cup, host nations have become world champions six times, and have made it to the semi finals on three other occasions. 

Even Korea, who wasn't a really strong team before the 2002 World Cup, made it to the semifinals beating Portugal, Italy and Spain before losing to Germany in the semifinals. 

The Germans have hosted the World Cup one just one occasion prior to the 2006 edition - in 1974, when they won it all.

Secondly, the Germans have history behind them. They are the second most successful team in World Cup history, only trailing the Brazilians, who have been eliminated. They are three time winners, winning it on their debut appearance in 1954, in 1974, when they won it on home soil, and in 1990, where they beat arch-rivals Argentina in the final. 

Additionally, the Germans have made the final a total of seven times, a world cup record. A record they'll extend to eight on July 9. They were runners-up in 1966, when they lost to hosts England; in 1982, when they lost to the Italians; and in 1986 and 2002 where they lost to South American giants Argentina and Brazil respectively. 

However, they played the later two outside Europe, where European sides fare poorly. Their finals record is even more impressive when their recent history is taken into consideration. In the last eight World Cups, Germany has made the final five times, winning it twice and finishing third on one occasion.

Coming into the 2006 World Cup, Coach Jürgen Klinsmann, a German soccer legend, received a lot of negativity from the German press because of his refusal to live in Germany, preferring sunny California instead. 

Bad results in early international matches didn't help either. His biggest criticism came after he selected Jens Lehmann as his first choice goalkeeper over national hero Oliver Khan, the 2002 World Cup MVP and arguably one of the best goalkeepers in the world. However, after Lehmann's superb job in the penalty shootout against Argentina, Klinsmann's critics have been silenced. 

Klinsmann can also be credited for changing the style of German soccer, from the traditional reserved style of play to a more attacking approach. 

Spearheaded by captain Michael Ballack, young striker Lukas Podolski and tournament top scorer Miroslav Klose, the Germans enter the semi-finals with their best ever record, winning all five of their games and scoring more goals than any other team. 

They meet an underwhelming Italian side that struggled against Ghana, the Czech Republic, the U.S.A. and Australia. Their most likely opponent in the final will be the 1998 champions, France, who have experienced a renaissance of sorts after barely making the second round. 

The French may have beaten Spain and the defending world champions but Zinedine Zidane and his company of old timers will lose steam once they play the young, confident hosts in the Final. The French should know this very well, since they won the cup at home in 1998.

However, in France's way stand Luis "Big Phil" Scolari's Portugal, who have not lost a game since 2004. Regardless of who they play in the final, the Manshafft will come out on top.

Subheadline: Tri-weekly classes will vex students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The University Faculty Senate will soon be considering a proposal by the Classroom Utilization Committee. This committee, which is in charge of making sure FIU uses its space wisely, has suggested that the University change its format from Monday/Wednesday classes to a format of classes held three times a week, the third of which being on Friday.

Classroom utilization is an issue for universities, mainly because those universities that inefficiently use their classroom and laboratory space receive fewer funds from the state for any construction plans the university may have in the future.

As students, our first and most obvious gripe with this new plan is that we would have to dedicate three days to a class, instead of the two we once used to.

Now, before you disregard this complaint as menial and childish, there's more to it than simply not wanting to come to school on a Friday. Students who are working, as well as attending school, will now have to worry about being in class three days out of the week instead of just two. 

This may not be such a big deal at other more traditional universities, but in a school where the majority of its students commute to campus, coming to class takes not just one hour out of a student's day, but three or four - once you take traffic into consideration.

It becomes even more of an obstacle for students driving or riding the shuttle busses to the Biscayne Bay Campus from University Park or vice-versa.

Despite being an added burden on students' time, should the schedule change become official, it will also be more of a strain on student's pocketbooks. 

Gas prices are not making it easier for anybody. With the national average at $2.86 per gallon, .64 more than it was at this time last year, driving to the University one more time a week will have its costs. 

Furthermore, students who plan on using the shuttle bus as their main means of getting to class - will find themselves paying an additional $64, per 16 week semester, for shuttle bus tickets - should the increased shuttle bus fee indeed reach $4 roundtrip, as it is expected to do so in the Fall semester.

Beside costing the average student more money to attend classes, a new 3-day format could inadvertently affect upperclassmen negatively. 

The way Panthersoft is set up right now gives younger students, like incoming Freshmen, first choice of classes. It is safe to assume that a student's first choice when it comes to class selection is going to be Tuesday/Thursday classes as they are only twice a week.

That said, we can speculate that Tuesday/Thursday classes are going to be occupied mainly by underclassmen, while the upperclassmen - older students who usually have busier schedule's than the younger students - will not only be left with the Monday/Wednesday/Friday classes, but also with less time for other responsibilities such as work.

Obviously,  the committee is not out to directly make the lives of students more difficult, but should take all of these factors into consideration when they make their decision. 

The committee should also look at the benefits, rather than just the disadvantages, of a Monday/Wednesday format.

With only two day's of scheduled class time, both student's and professor's alike can spend more time actually researching and studying, rather than just getting to class. 

The Beacon understands that the University must find the most efficient use of its classroom space, but it hopes that all of the above-mentioned variables are carefully considered and that a decision is reached that is in the best interest of the student.

Headline: Original Gaza pullout leaves Israel few options
Author: Jose De Wit / Asst. Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Attempting to understand the decades of violent Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a contentious task, inevitably charged with emotional and ideological reactions to the situation. 

Moreover, even having set aside the unimanigable chore of assigning partial or total blame to either party, simply trying to detect a reason and a logical beginning to the blurry chain of violence begetting violence is an impossibly confusing, chicken-and-egg-type dilemma.

However, the current escalation of events in the area stands in sharp contrast to the chronology preceding it, in that it has a clearly identifiable cause - namely, former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's ill-conceived withdrawal from the Gaza strip and much of the West Bank last year. The withdrawal, though lauded by many groups as a groundbreaking step in the frustratingly elusive "roadmap for peace," was hastily planned and implemented.   

Negotiating a cease-fire is only a preliminary step in the peace process. The core of the peace talks has always been the objective of negotiating the eventual establishment of a Palestinian nation.

 Israel's withdrawal initiative, however, was completely disconnected from bilateral dialogue. Being a unilateral initiative, the withdrawal was implemented on Israeli terms exclusively.

Such terms were designed in such a way that left Palestine at a clear economic disadvantage. Furthermore, Israel retained control over most of the Palestinian border, as well as the Gaza coastline. 

Last, by sidestepping the peace process, Israel's unilateral disengagement plan effectively stalled all negotiations toward consolidating Palestine's political autonomy. All this left Palestinians in a prison for which only Israel held the keys.

After crippling the Palestinians with economic stagnation and placing them in a political stalemate, Israel pulled out and left them to their own devices. 

By doing so, Sharon set Palestine in a direct course toward disaster, and then turned his back to avoid having to take responsibility when it struck. Impoverished, frustrated, starving and with no diplomatic solution in sight, it was only a matter of time before Palestinians grew tired of this arrangement and decided to lash out.

Given that Palestine's accustomed method for expressing its grievances toward its neighbor has traditionally consisted of assassinations, homemade rockets and acts of terrorism, it was hardly unexpected when reports arrived that Palestinian militias had kidnapped an Israeli soldier and executed a civilian hostage. 

Because Israel's accustomed method for dealing with such insurgency has always been to call in the artillery, it is hardly surprising that Israel has made its disapproval manifest by organizing bombings of both military and civilian facilities and orchestrating a full-scale military re-occupation of the Gaza strip.

A final consequence of Israel's disengagement from the Gaza strip is that, besides setting the scene for a potentially dramatic situation, it also made itself vulnerable and unable to deal with the consequences once the drama erupted. Before the evacuation, Israel had ample security forces stationed along the border and throughout the Gaza strip. 

Had these security forces been there when the Palestinian militia decided to start taking hostages, it might have been able to neutralize the situation and react proportionally to the militia's actions. 

Instead, the only options Israel had available for dealing with the militia's aggressions were to ignore them and remain silent, or to put together a massive re-invasion campaign such as the one it has arranged of late. By withdrawing unilaterally, Sharon left his country in a position where it had to respond to relatively mild threats with disproportionately violent action.

Considering both countries' past behavior and common history, the events that have transpired in the past week are tragic but, given the parties involved, nothing out of the ordinary. 

They are simply a textbook case of what can happen when a stronger party tries to manipulate a geopolitical conflict in its favor without taking into account its adversary's needs, rather than resorting to dialogue and attempting to negotiate a reasonable compromise.
