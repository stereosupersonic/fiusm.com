Headline: Baseball loses two straight to UM
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Opening the season with a series against your cross-town rival has the potential to stir a battle of epic proportions.

For the baseball team, however, that battle turned lopsided, resulting in two losses - to a combined score of 22-3 - to the University of Miami on Jan. 28-29.

FIU left opening weekend with a record of 0-2, while the relatively young Miami team stands at 2-0.

The Golden Panthers go on to face in-state foe Central Florida Feb. 4-5 at University Park Stadium.



UM 17, FIU 3



The opening match at Mark Light Field showed a UM team dominating on the mound and in the batter's box, which resulted in the lopsided final score.

"It was a very, very long day," head coach Danny Price said. "They out-pitched us, they out-hit us [and] they out-played us. There's nothing I can say. We got out-played."

Walker Whitley was saddled with the loss in his first appearance as a Golden Panther. The redshirt junior allowed seven runs on seven hits, walked two and struck out two batters.

Miami starter Carlos Guiterrez picked up his first career win in five innings of work, allowing just one hit.

The game made a turn for the worse for FIU in the third inning, as the Hurricanes - who came into the inning with a 1-0 lead - scored six runs of Whitley. UM's Tommy Giles and Blake Tekotte each had a two-RBI single in the inning.

Miami's offensive explosion continued in the fifth inning as they scored another seven runs - off a Jon Jay grand slam and a Giles three-run homerun - off FIU reliever Eduardo Elias to make it 14-0.

Junior Cody Jacobs prevented UM's shutout with a two-run homerun to left center in the sixth inning.

Miami countered with three more runs in the bottom of the inning to take a 17-2 lead.

The Golden Panthers scored their final run of the contest in the seventh inning.

Freshman Alex Alfonso singled down the left field line, followed by another single to left by centerfielder Bryan Pullin. Alfonso advanced to third on a sacrifice fly and was eventually brought around to score off a single by senior Michael Lopez.

Six Golden Panthers recorded a hit in the contest, including Lopez, Alfonso, Jacobs, Pullin, third baseman Nick Cadena and Luis Bautista, who came in to play catcher in the bottom of the seventh.



UM 5, FIU 0



The Hurricanes continued to blow away FIU in the second game, in front of a crowd of 2,112 spectators at University Park Stadium, shutting out the Golden Panthers offensively.

"Offensively, we just didn't get going," Price said. "I think, today, a good team lost and a better team won."

Left fielder Chris Siebenaler picked up the loss, allowing five runs (three earned) on nine hits, walking three and striking out three batters in seven innings of work.

The junior gave up eight hits in the first two innings, but settled down for the remainder of his outing, giving up just one hit over the next five innings.

The game also marked the first time in 156 starts that Lopez starts a position other than first base or designated hitter. 

Miami scored its five runs in the first four inning of the game, highlighted by a Tekotte two-run homerun in the second.

 FIU had a possible rally going in the sixth inning, but was immediately halted following a baserunning mistake that led to a double play. 

Sophomore James McOwen reached on an infield single and moved up to second when Lopez was hit by a pitch. Cadena hit a fly ball to shallow left field, right behind the infield. 

UM second baseman Jemile Weeks misjudged the ball initially, but leaned back and made the catch. McOwen, playing for a possible drop, was double up at second base as UM shortstop Roger Tomas made a diving catch on the throw from Weeks.

Pullin, McOwen, Alfonso, second baseman Corey Lozano and newcomer Kurt Crowell each recorded one of FIU's five hits.

"I like our club," Price said. "We just got going offensively. We just did not swing the bat today. That's what it comes down to."

Headline: Elite quarterback no longer needed to win big game
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a game with so much hype - that comes a daunting two weeks removed from the NFL Conference Championships - it's easy to over-scrutinize. 

Big networks like CBS, NBC, ABC and ESPN have the overwhelming task of extensive Super Bowl coverage in the wake of nothing to talk about.

Only a guy as ordinary and mild- mannered as Matt Hasselbeck could afford to be overlooked in a game like this. It seems like all you hear about the quarterback position for this game is Ben Roethlisberger. 

It's a combination of the media desperately looking for this era's Dan Marino or Joe Montana (they surely didn't find it in choke artist Peyton Manning) and being too quick to brand Ben Roethlisberger as the 'Steelers' Savior.'

Big Ben is just another Tom Brady  - not necessarily a good thing. A young, good-looking kid that was put on a good team that had their starting quarterback get hurt. 

Ever since Roethlisberger started playing in the NFL, he began to put his games on cruise control and let his talented teams take him to undeserving glory. 

I'm not saying Brady or Roethlisberger are not good quarterbacks, but they're not Montana or Marino, and they're definitely not Johnny Unitas.  

We finally saw what happened with Brady when the other team was better. He had no answer. The sports world just needs to accept the fact that the golden age of football, where an elite quarterback is the hero, is beyond us.

This off-season, the last breed of quarterback who could dominate games single-handedly, even when his team was no good, will retire in a Green Bay Packers uniform. We will no longer have the privilege of being marveled by guys who sit in the pocket and complete pass after pass in January (sorry Peyton).

As for now, lets give credit where credit is due. Hasselbeck could have easily walked away with the MVP this season. He threw far more yards and had more touchdowns than  Roethlisberger; he also threw the same amount of interceptions in almost 200 more attempts.

But come on, Hasselbeck can't be the big time quarterback in the big time game.  He doesn't do "Got Milk" commercials or have a sandwich named after him.  He's not a sex icon either - the 31 year old is balding for goodness sake.  

Hasselbeck could go to an Outback restaurant anywhere outside the Pacific Northwest and they'd give him a pager, just like everybody else.  He's probably not even the most famous guy at his house for dinner some nights. All because he doesn't fit the mold.  

The only reason Hasselbeck didn't win the MVP was because the guy he was handing the ball off to had a record-breaking season. 

Still, for some reason, the Steelers are favored by four points over the 13-3 Seahawks.

 Star power must be a very powerful thing.

When the Seahawks played their first playoff game this season, their MVP got hurt during the first quarter. Who drove them back to win the game? That's right, Hasselbeck.  But still, nobody looks at that. Nobody looks at the fact that he lost his star wide receiver, Darrell Jackson, during the regular season and still found a way to throw for 3500 yards and 24 touchdowns.

Everybody wants to look at Roethlisberger, who made a desperate, Catholic school girl tackle against Indianapolis in order to 'save' the game.

But I understand why the media would hype up Big Ben this week, in a game where there's no  Brady, no 'greatest show on turf' and no Manning. 

Actually, the only guy for the Steelers who has ever been to the Super Bowl is backup cornerback Willie Williams, who probably won't even suit up on Sunday.

The only thing XL about this Super Bowl is Jerome Bettis's waist-size. There is no star-power, and when there's no star-power, star-power has to be created.

You know it's a bad Super Bowl when the only thing reporters could come up with as a story line is that Jerome Bettis is going back to his hometown of Detroit in his final year to get a chance to win the big game.

As touching as that may sound, Bettis is a guy that should have retired years ago. He averages a decimal number of yards per carry. 

The only players the average fan can recognize in this game without a helmet on are Bettis and Roethlisberger. 

That's the audience Super Bowl XL will draw. The Paris Hilton-type of fans - just here for the after-party (or the halftime show).

So while Roethlisberger and Bettis are sitting in Pittsburgh getting praised by the media, Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander are on the first flights to Detroit trying to soak it all in.

Truth is, the Seahawks are the better team in this game, even though the names on the back of their uniforms are not household. 

They have the two best players in the NFC behind the line of scrimmage, they're versatile on both sides of the ball and they're quarterback has proven he can win games by himself.  

Fans will be disappointed Sunday night, as the Seahawks will win Super Bowl XL, but Hasselbeck will be living it up with fellow unknown Seahawks as they shock the blind sports world.

He'll celebrate with teammates, have a short press conference, probably have a feature on ESPN the Magazine and go back to a 2006-2007 season that will find him overlooked again.  I guess he wouldn't have it any other way.

Headline: Out & About    A column by Leoncio Alvarez
Subheadline: Coming Out: my personal experience
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
"Mom, I'm gay." 

"You think you're surprising me with this?" my mother responded. "I'm your mother, no one knows you better."

"So you're absolutely OK with this?" I asked.

"Of course, from the minute you were born I swore to love you unconditionally no matter what. This is not going to alter my promise."

I was ecstatic. That's it. No more lying, no more games. I was out to the most important person in my life and she accepted it …


Not even close


Seeing my mother age 15 years in the span of five minutes wasn't easy, and hearing the words "disgusting lifestyle" come out of her mouth wasn't exactly my idea of a successful 'coming out' situation, but that's what she really thought of it. 

I asked her if she had any idea about my sexuality before and she told me it was something she kept in the back of her mind and refused to tell any members of our family.

I should have planned it better, had more things to say, but the situation just arose and I took the initiative to step up and tell her about myself. I was brave, a description I seldom use to describe myself, and I received absolutely no positive feedback from her for my boldness.


The supposed plan


When a woman becomes pregnant, she envisions a certain life for her child. Real life happens and that plan becomes tainted as the child grows up and makes his own decisions - putting life into his own hands.

I've known I am gay since elementary school, when the stereotypical and ever popular blonde boy would pick on me for my lack of attraction to girls and all I could think of were his beautiful baby blues. I became even more in tune with my sexuality when I entered high school and found myself attracted to the guy who was questioned by everyone … just like me. 

My sexuality is not a mistake; I realized this soon after meeting other gay journalists like myself at a convention last October. Being in a circle of men and women who share the same feelings and emotions which I have struggled with made me realize I wasn't alone. 

I talked to others who had come out previously and found many mixed parental reactions - some were accepting while others simply kicked their child to the street. Even though the group did help me in finding my own identity and coming out path, I did become frightened by the thought of losing my mother.

And as popular as it is to believe, being gay is not a choice. Nobody wants to risk being denied affection by his or her own mother for the simple fact of liking the same sex, and if they did, they need a hasty medical check up.


Aftermath


Since the incident, my mother and I have regained speaking terms, but our bond and love was destroyed by this three-letter word.

If you are planning on coming out to your parents any time soon, the best advice I have to give is choose your words wisely. The way you describe yourself and your lifestyle to your parents is key to their acceptance - this is where I went wrong.

Talk to some family members who you are close to and see how they react before doing anything too drastic. Research some cases where the coming out process didn't prove successful - you must be prepared for the worst-case scenario. 

And above all, don't feel ashamed of yourself if your parents don't accept you. Feel liberated, at ease and comfortable with yourself. Don't hold back and be proud of who you are, because if you aren't then who will? 



Look for this column every other Thursday in The Beacon.

Headline: Campus rally incites anger
Author: Adrian Cordero / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you crossed the fountain niche between Graham Center, Primera Casa and the Green Library anytime between 11 a.m. and  4 p.m. on Jan. 30, it is likely the words 'sinner' or 'hate-monger' reached your ears. Just prior to or after those shrieks of righteous indignation, you doubtlessly sighted a throng of students gathered before a rabble-rousing evangelical demonstration.

I've witnessed few demonstrations since enrolled at FIU. A handful of hunger strikes here and there, sometimes leaf-letters, but this was actually the first time I saw a full on campus demonstration complete with opposing protestors. The agitation was not over an unjust war, abortion-rights nor environmental issues. In actuality, it was a screaming contest with both sides arguing over whether some magician in the sky, more commonly known as God, really hates Gays or not. 

The gay issue might not have been what the Campus Ministry USA themed its platform on, but it's what garnered the attention and wrath of the students present. I think a more subtle approach might've better suited them. Less condemnation and accusation of students being an abomination just because they have a different sexual orientation (Ministry members also wore sandwich boards denouncing witches, dopers, fornicators, blasphemers and most other fun recreational activities).

As a realist, I am instantly disinclined to most bombastic ethereal babble but the sheer number and vibrant agitation of the mob attracted me. It would be an understatement to say the crowd was antipathetic. They were very much a crude bunch. Waving make-shift signs and blushing red in the face when they spat words and saliva back at the preachers.

I had few problems with either group. The only time the sermons, chants, parades and flamboyance annoyed me was when they were flaunted in my face. However, this might just be my own small conflict with the great expanse of the first amendment. 

All the same, in this age of science and constant refutation of long-held superstitions, I do believe groups like the evangelicals are simply permeating ignorance. Isn't it at least arguable that belief in gods is irrational and that social policy based on belief in the supernatural is absurd and potentially dangerous?

 Easing myself into the periphery of the crowd, I asked a fellow bystander what the gist of it all was. "A buncha' crazies screaming nonsensically," he responded, and I couldn't immediately identify which of the two groups he was referring to. The protestors were definitely the more coarse and brutal, at one point even snatching and smashing a sign held by a Ministry member. Is that how you rationally win an argument?

The ringleader of the congregation was George "Jed" Smock, whose followers were called 'Jed-heads' - a play on the name of the Grateful Dead groupies. 

"They're too emotional because no one likes being called a sinner. They choose emotion over reality," Smock said - a quote perhaps a bit oxymoronic from someone who follows a religion known historically for preaching faith over science. "That they respond with such bitterness and resentment says a lot about their logic".  To me, an evangelist even using the word logic is beyond comedic.

In the end, it's all a matter of first amendment rights. The preachers exercise two clauses in their demonstration: that of freedom of religion and freedom of speech. The protestors exercise just one; their right to yell, get upset and accomplish very little at all. And I, with a smirk on my lips and a pen in my hand, exercise another clause of the first amendment: to write an opinion on the foolishness and futility of it all because, in the end, it was just used up oxygen and dispersed carbon dioxide, little else, little more.

Headline: Scholarship breakfast honors Cuban poet Jose Marti
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A diverse group of students, faculty and contributors gathered Jan. 28 at Biscayne Bay Campus to pay homage to Jose Marti, the 19th century Cuban poet and leader of that country's independence movement.

This breakfast, celebrated the date of Marti's birth however, it was not meant as an exclusive celebration for the Cuban community but for all who have read and been inspired by Marti's writings.

The comedic television personality, Chef Pepin, led the presentation and amused all with his loud expressive tones. 

Also featured were various presentations celebrating the Cuban traditions of salsa, folk song and dance. 

This 'breakfast with a purpose'  raised scholarships and other funds and provided a different way of honoring Marti's name. 

Many of the sponsors of the event were present, such as Pepe Badia of Badia Spices.

Three students from both Miami-Dade College and FIU were honored at the breakfast with scholarships; Nicole Salazar, a senior majoring in chemistry at FIU was one of the winners.

"I [the flier for the scholarship] and was interested to find out the impact that Marti has on the rest of the countries in South and Central America. I wanted to know who he was as a person and know more about his literature," Salazar said. 

Salazar is also a member of the Biscayne Bay Campus Science Club.  The group prepared a photographic presentation at the beginning on the breakfast of the tropical Cuban landscape.

Though the presentation was focused mainly on Marti's impact in other countries, the Cuban majority present was obvious by the sighs heard and the passion that was felt when the Cuban National anthem was sung a cappella by Rolando Montoya, the president of MDC. 

Haza spoke of Marti's various relationships with the elite as well as those who loved and respected him.

"Marti's love extended to all the Caribbean because he was a man with great depth and a great ability to love," Montoya said.

Marti's international consonance was shown when Gideon Shavit, Israel emissary and regional director of the Jewish National Fund, presented a sign with Marti's name in Hebrew and English.  The sign referred to a water resvoir that would be placed in Israel in Marti's name. There is also a forest named after Marti in Israel.

"Though I am not originally from Cuba it is good to gather and remember his message [was] not just for Cuba, but for all," Shavit said.

Oscar Haza, a well-known journalist  who has worked for Univision and Telemundo, gave an informative oration on Marti's influence in the Dominican Republic. 

Haza emphasized the need for Marti's message to live on.

"Today's generation need[s] to keep the thoughts and identity of Marti alive, as the character of the Cuban people. His legacy spans countries," Haza said. 

Haza describes Marti as someone who relate to the rich and the poor.

"Marti was a man of the people, that's why he suffered and people envied him," Haza said. "With the death of a man comes myth and immortality, destiny granted him immorality."

The BBC library has also taken part in this tribute adding the "Rincon Martiano," a display near the entrance featuring books, plays and other pieces of Marti's work.

Senior and spanish major  Charilyn Gauiria attended the event with her mother and represented the Cuban Research Institute at FIU.

"It was a pleasure for me to come and enjoy the breakfast and remember Jose Marti because now I see the symbol he was of a free Cuba and a representative of Cuban and American ideals. He was known in all parts, not just Cuba," Gauiria said.

Headline: New agreement answers faculty concerns
Author: Ruben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After three years of stalled contract, the executive committee of FIU's Board of Trustees approved a new collective bargaining agreement on Dec. 30, the result of four days of intensive compromises between both the administration team and the faculty union bargaining teams. 

At one point, the faculty union had taken the administration to court at the state level citing "unfair labor practices." Thus, with the new agreement, both the faculty and the administration state they have reasons to be pleased.

"I am gratified that we have reached an agreement that allows for the continued growth of the academic community," said Ronald Berkman, interim provost. "With the agreement, we can rest assure that the faculty will be energized and more actively engaged in the University."

Among the highlights of the FIU United Faculty of Florida's collective bargaining agreement are a 3.6 percent salary increase across the board, a 10-12 percent raise on promotion, substantial sabbatical benefits, abolition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, expanded academic freedom and a new parental leave policy.

The administration team and the faculty union bargaining team comprised of faculty union head Alan Gummerson and faculty members Joan Baker, Paul Warren and Lorna Veraldi, who acted as chief negotiator. 

Faculty union head Alan Gummerson, who worked with Berkman on negotiating the terms of the agreement, was particularly happy with the new parental leave policy and the changes made to the current academic freedom policy.

The new parental leave policy offers a one time, six-month leave at full pay for a new parent, in addition to the right of using unused sick or annual leaves.

"We can attract a better faculty now. Those coming out of graduate school looking for jobs but who may be thinking of having children will be attracted to this place," Gummerson said. "FIU is the first university in the state to agree to such a policy. It's maybe the best policy in the country." 

According to Gummerson, the academic freedom policy expands beyond the faculty member's academic subject and allows the faculty to speak freely on all matters of university governance, as well as the freedom to speak, write or act as an individual - all without institutional discipline or restraint.

Clarity about academic freedom was a concern for faculty members because the old contract was much more restricted. The old agreement gave faculty members the freedom to speak only within their academic qualifications. 

"The new contract allows them to speak freely on all matters of university governance without the fear for their job," Gummerson said. "If you go downtown and march against the war in Iraq, the university can't fire you."

Two issues the faculty union is still working on with the administration are copyrights and patents. 

This deals, in part, with the ownership and control of intellectual property.  

Bruce Hauptli, president of the Faculty Senate explained this issue.

"Imagine a faculty member writes a book and says 'I want to own it.' But at the same time imagine the administration saying 'I pay you so I want to own the book.' There are clear agreements and disagreements," Hauptli said. "There are ways [to] deal with these things and I'm confident that the two sides will work it out." 

For the last 30 years there was a state-wide contract between the state university system and the UFF. 

This contract included the 11 major public universities. 

The contract ended when Florida Gov. Jeb Bush dissolved the state-wide university system, the Florida Board of Regents, in 2001. 

The state-wide university system was succeeded by the local board of trustees who were hoping the faculty wouldn't need a union. 

These events led up to the need of an agreement between the administration and the faculty union. This issue was a highly contested one for two years.

"There was a lot of labor unrest during the last three years. [The faculty wasn't] happy that the administration was trying to convert a lot of issues out of the contract and into a policy. Good relationships between the two sides [went sour] after this extended period of uncertainty," Hauptli said. "Now both sides have a collective agreement that they think is very good."

The new bargaining agreement, approved by the board of trustees, now awaits ratification from the faculty union who are widely expected to vote in favor of it. 

The ratification election is to be held Feb. 14 at the Biscayne Bay Campus and Feb. 15 at University Park and the Engineering Center.

"In the end, we're happy that we've finally come to an agreement and now the faculty can concentrate on their jobs without worrying about this anymore," Hauptli said.

Headline: Budget management cuts debt
Subheadline: Appropriate procedures assure stability
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For college students, proper money management is a learned skill. With classes, jobs and other personal matters filling up students' schedules, it can be very hard to monitor expenses and very easy to fall into debt. Loans and frequent credit card offers just add to the complications of managing money. 

Luckily, there are plenty of ways to easily cut down on spending money while attending college. Sacrifices will have to be made but your wallet or purse will thank you after graduation. Here are a few tips to help you save money and escape from college debt-free:



Make a Budget



Your first step toward financial stability should be figuring out exactly how much money you're earning and spending each month - calculate your income and add up all your expenses. By forming a budget, you can view exactly where your money is going and change your spending habits accordingly. Without a budget, you won't have a strong grasp of your financial situation. 

University Credit Union member service representative Valerie Henry strongly suggests creating a budget.

"College students should mainly focus on creating a budget and establishing credit for future purchases," said Henry. 



Join a Financial Institution



Go to a local bank or credit union and research the various services the institution offers. Open a savings account and regularly deposit money into the account. Aside from a savings account, institutions offer different services for different needs. The on-campus University Credit Union has several savings options such as Money Market Accounts and Individual Retirement Accounts. 

"The University Credit Union is a non-profit organization, so any investments made are going to benefit the member," Henry said.  



Find Cheaper Alternatives



If your budget shows that your income isn't enough for your expenses, start searching for less expensive items. 

Textbooks are a major expense for any college student; try looking online for better deals or ask your friends if they previously took the class and buy the needed book from them. 

Similarly, simple changes in daily routines can save you several dollars. Bringing your own lunch instead of buying food at campus dining locations can curb small expenses such as campus lunches. 

"I've saved a lot of money by bringing my own lunch. I only save a few dollars a week, but every cent adds up when you're a college student," said sophomore Juan Vega. 



Avoid Credit Card Abuse



Although the free shirt might be tempting, think twice before signing up for another credit card offer. One credit card should be enough for most college students - don't go overboard. Instead of using your credit card, students should make purchases with cash. With a credit card, students tend to think they have more money than they really have. If you make purchases with cash, the feel of your wallet, or purse, getting lighter will make you rethink spending your money. 

"Students shouldn't take every credit card offer they get. Students with credit cards tend to spend more than their income. Always spend within your limitations," Henry said.



Get More Money



Because cutting costs may sometimes seem impossible, find ways to increase your income. Working more hours at your job or finding a higher-paying job can give your income a significant boost, but don't let the increased responsibilities affect your grades. If you're already working too much, search for alternative sources of income. Grants and scholarships can help out students in financial need. All you have to do is look for these items online and apply. 

"I live off my scholarship refunds. Because of my erratic schedule, I can't work but my scholarship money helps with my expenses," said sophomore Alex Rodriguez.

Headline: Independent film event hosted by alumnus
Author: Leoncio Alvarez and Alicia Bustamante / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Justin Routt, FIU alumnus and now renowned filmmaker, hosts a variety of film events throughout some of Miami's most exotic and prestigious hot spots. The most recent was the Sundance After Party held Jan. 29 at the Marrakech-inspired Shore Club Hotel's Skybar in Miami Beach. Here, hanging lanterns, plush couches, soft red lights and a laidback atmosphere greeted movie goers as Routt showed three short films: Hairless, Shelter and Candy Paint. 

Hairless is a light-hearted yet warm look at a woman afflicted with alopecia universalis - a total loss of hair all over the body. In such an image-conscious society, especially for young women, it was refreshing to see the main character Alyssa (played with genuine heart by Angelique Little) shuck mainstream conformity to be happy with who she is: bald and beautiful. Writer and director Sarah Johnson tells a well-rounded story utilizing humor without losing depth - a difficult task to accomplish within the confines of a 17-minute running time. 

The showing took a somber turn with the presentation of Shelter, a film where the main-characters' storylines cross through the act of seeking shelter from the rain. A quiet film where dialogue and close-ups were the main focus, Shelter toes the line between drama and melodrama - especially when a crisis counselor's mantra of believing in a six percent chance of sunshine versus a 94 percent chance of rain is discussed. At 18 minutes, the film felt much longer, which is more a testament of a barely engaging plot than one's complete immersion. 

Candy Paint, an energetic and youthful film, was the most mainstream of the three. Revolving around high school senior Brad Miller and his quest to take the most popular girl to prom, Brad goes through a series of comic events (pawning a prize-winning Pomeranian dog, buying Gwyneth Paltrow's Oscar dress, selling a low-rider adorned with the image of the Virgin Mary, among many others) in order to accomplish his goal. 

The film felt like it could have been in a toned-down American Pie series, especially with small roles from Nickelodeon's Kenan Thompson and the mom from "Home Improvement," Patricia Richardson. As the longest of the short films, a surprisingly fast-paced 27 minutes, it was able to tell a fully developed sitcom-style story.

This particular event was free of charge, but that doesn't mean the extras available were even close to complimentary. Drinks were offered throughout the night and not at a cheap price. 

The audience was encouraged to stay after the showings and shoot some rounds of pool while listening to a mix of hip-hop, reggae and '90s music, provided by DJ Tommy Ryk.

Along with his independent film company Birch Creek Films, writer and producer Routt has held other film events at locations including B.E.D, The Delano Hotel, Hotel Victor, Miami Museum of Science Planetarium and The Biltmore Hotel.

Routt's next event will be at the Coconut Grove Art Festival held Feb. 18 - 19.

"This will be the first time movies will be shown at the Art festival and I am glad to be part of this project," Routt said.

The audience of Routt's events vary in age but he hopes to attract a more college-age group.

"The films I show are meant to catch the eye of younger crowds," Routt said.

Along with continuing to hold film events in Miami, Routt hopes to expand his horizons by holding different kinds of events - including a fashion show in Sarasota this spring.

Subheadline: Student geared program mixes high culture with low prices
Author: Nicole Acosta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Students will now be able enjoy a variety of cultural events for a price that won't drain the bank thanks to Culture Shock Miami. 

The program is a service that offers students between the ages of 14 to 22 a chance to go to cultural events and performances ranging from theater and dance to music and festivals throughout Miami-Dade County for only $5 per ticket. The first ticket must be used by a student but each additional ticket can be given to anyone the student wishes to invite.

"Arts [events'] audiences are aging," said Gerry Landreth, program administrator for Culture Shock Miami. "They need younger audiences but [youth's] resources are very limited. We have taken away the barrier of price," he said.

 Aaron Margolis, a sophomore voice performance major, said he goes to cultural events as often as he can, usually spending anywhere from $20 to $80.

After hearing about Culture Shock, Margolis thinks it is was a good idea. 

"It promotes student involvement in cultural activities. It makes it more affordable and more practical for students to enjoy events or functions we otherwise would not be able to enjoy," he said. "We won't get a future audience if we don't get them now."

Ashley Hill, a sophomore music education major, goes to cultural events less frequently than Margolis, even though music is a passion of hers. The reason why: high ticket prices. She now plans to take advantage of Culture Shock Miami.

"I definitely will use it because it's extremely affordable," Hill said. "I'm excited to start using this service and to see how it really promotes the arts."

Culture Shock Miami, which is made possible by the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, created a partnership with Ticketmaster and cultural organizations to make the actual process of buying tickets to an event advantageous to the student. 

It even has two-for-one deals for admission into some of Miami-Dade's museums, which include Miami Metro Zoo, Vizcaya Museum and Gardens and The Wolfsonian.

Phillip M. Church, associate professor of theater and head of performance program, thinks Culture Shock is a good program for students.

"Culture Shock is good if it means bringing in new young people to discover the arts," he said.

Church realized the long-term benefits of luring students to go to cultural events at affordable prices.

Hill is glad that Culture Shock Miami is available.

"It allows people to do things that enhance you on an educational level. It gives more opportunities to do something different that most people wouldn't be able to do on a regular basis," Hill said.

Landreth said that Culture Shock Miami's goal of making the arts easy and accessible to young people seems to be succeeding.

"We've doubled our sales over the previous year," he said.

As long as Culture Shock keeps making ticket prices affordable, it will attract students like Hill, who believes it's important to promote all forms of art in this generation, but would also like to see more affordable cultural events. 

According to Culture Shock Miami's website, tickets are limited for each event, and encourage students to order their tickets in advance.

To get tickets online, students must visit www.cultureshockmiami.com to find an event they would like to attend. 

If a student wishes to pay with cash, they must visit any Ticketmaster outlet with proof of their age. They must give the sales agent the name and date of the event they wish to attend.

Headline: Star forward expecting baby, excited to be father

Continued from the Jan. 30 edition of The Beacon

Q: Who do you think are the guys that are going to have to step up their play in order for this team to succeed in the post-season?

When you have a lot of new people, that is the problem. One day one feels that consistency is the most important thing. 

I try and play hard, a person plays well, another day another person plays well. With me, if I have to get 15 rebounds every game I try to do it. 

Sometimes, I don't score that much but someone else does. As a team, we need to play well together. If someone makes a mistake then someone made a mistake. 

Some of the young guys are going to have to step it up. Kenny [Simms] is just a sophomore but he is our big guy. I think he has been playing pretty well since the conference started so I have confidence that he will do well, especially when the conference tournament starts. 

Ish [N'Diaye] has probably been struggling the most. His offense hasn't been there but his defense is much better than last year, so it is not about just what you do offensively in a game. 

Sometimes the stat lines lie. You see a stat and say 'he isn't doing anything this year' but you come to watch the game and you see the guy he is guarding, a guy that scores 20 points a game and when he comes to us he scores four or five. I think if we keep playing hard - the guys that were here last year - the new guys will step it up. 

Q: Since you stepped on the court last season for the first time at FIU, you have led this team. What do you expect out of yourself every night?

I expect myself to go out there and play hard. When I got hurt during the Michigan State game, I think I came back sooner than I should have. The injury was bothering me a little bit and I had a couple of games that I wasn't trusting myself in what I could do. 

I had a couple of meetings with the coaches and they told me to just go out and have fun. I came into the season thinking 'this is Ivan Almonte and he is going to come out and score 20 [points] a game' and for a couple of games I wasn't having that much fun. 

Now, I just want to go out and have fun, play basketball and play hard. If I happen to have a good night, then I had a good night, if not, I just hope the team wins. I try to play hard every night for myself, but I am not a finesse player. I try top out play whoever is playing me, getting rebounds, trying to score when I can and trying to get everyone on the team involved.

Q: Finally, you are about to become a father, when is the baby due and have you thought of any names?

The baby has a couple more weeks left, no, one more week really. They are going to induce here on [Feb. 5] if she hasn't had the baby. We just went to the doctor and he said that she has a pretty good chance of having it soon, so they may not have to induce her. 

We picked the name a long time ago - Kyan. We are pretty excited about that, I know it's going to be a little difficult, I know it has been a little difficult for me playing on the road. 

When I'm in the game I am focused on the game, but as a human you have feelings and you are thinking 'what is going on with her?' Everything has worked out well and we are happy he is coming pretty soon.
