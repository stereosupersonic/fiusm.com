Headline: Venezuela's Chavez ruins nation's spirit of democracy
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
Venezuela is a big part of my life. Although I was born in the United States, I spent nine years of my life there.

For the past few months, my political conscience in conjunction with the love I bear for the country my parents came from have been urging me to voice all the resentment I bear for the man who currently stands as president of that nation.

Hugo Chavez does not deserve the title of president, because he is nothing short of a tyrant, I hold no respect for him, because he deliberately deceives a whole nation and destroys the essence of true politics.

It is true that previous Venezuelan leaders were corrupt and crooked as well, but this man has not only adhered himself to corruption, his presidency has brought a greater evil. 

Chavez purposely inflicted a wound on the Venezuelan people.  The wound of social resentment.

In an absurd manner, he has returned to socialist, almost communist, ideals and has turned the poor against the rich.  In the year 2002, he relies on archaic terms such as "proletariat" and "bourgeoisie" with the purpose of annihilating the Venezuelan middle class, at which he has been very successful.

We complain about George W. Bush's long speeches, but the Venezuelan people have it much worse.  The egocentric Chavez subjects the nation to weekly speeches, which usually run about three hours long, speeches which are always filled with words that inspire hatred and separation and sometimes information about his sexual life.

He condemns anybody who owns a house or a car and labels them as "aristocrats."  He presents himself as the king of the poor and displays all kinds of stereotyped behavior in order to identify with this social group.  However, this is far from the truth because this man has indulged in a life of travel and pleasures ever since the beginning of his presidential term.

I believe his politics disrespect the basic essence of any democracy.  Supported by a non-representational and biased Congress, he has stepped all over the Venezuelan Constitution.  He refers to it as "la bicha," which literally means "that thing."  

I believe a Constitution is the fundamental basis of a nation's structure and should always be approached with discretion.  Treat it carelessly and you will have a country without a sense of identity, which is the strong force that binds people under one nation.

He has injured the image of the Venezuelan people by disrespecting foreign cultures in his travels as a diplomat.  Proof of this was the embarrassing image broadcasted around the world of President Chavez trying to touch Queen Elizabeth.

Moreover, as a journalism major, I feel offended by his open attacks on the media, which is an essential institution to any democracy. It is shameful to see how Chavez gets away with dishonorable things such as paying delinquents to attack the offices of "El Nacional," a respected newspaper that is dedicated to searching for the truth.

I consider despicable the fact that he upholds a fraternal friendship with the renowned terrorist Carlos Illich Ramirez (a.k.a. "The Jackal") and am not surprised by the recent evidence that links Chavez to the Colombian guerrilla and that reveal he might have received funding from totalitarian Arab regimes for his presidential campaign.

I admire the Venezuelan people for displaying an incredible amount of civility in view of all these situations.  It must be hard to not go crazy when witnessing Chavez's recent purchase of a $60 million plane while the bolivar is overly devalued and the economy is crashing.

I applaud the opposition's peaceful civil marches and protests, but I believe that this civility will not last long. Chavez has created a new enemy, PDVSA, a government oil company, which is sick and tired of the demented leader's ludicrous and senseless act of giving away free oil to Cuba.

Pressure keeps on building and if strong measures are not taken to obtain Chavez' resignation, he will stay up on the throne long after his term is over, in an attempt to imitate his idol, Castro.  Venezuelans will continue to be governed by Chavez and his friends in a bureaucratic system.

I dream of a beautiful country that has much to give if guided by a good leader.  I just hope for the day when Chavez, who only brings political, social and economic plagues to Venezuela, vanishes from politics.  

Only then will the nation start searching for that sense of identity that it lost along the way.

Headline: In Our View: FIU should be more inclusive with College of Engineering
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
And you thought Biscayne Bay students were excluded. Tucked away on West Flagler St. is the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences, the only FIU school not located on either University Park or Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Though not adjacent to the University Park campus, the engineering school is in fact considered part of it. Unfortunately, the campus does not receive all the amenities offered to the schools that actually reside on the UP campus. 

Students taking a majority of their classes at the island campus are cut off from most of the events at University Park. That's obvious. But the best way to remedy that is to at least make an effort to keep the students on the engineering campus informed about what's going on. 

If there's a speaker or an event at University Park, students at the engineering campus should be informed with flyers, e-mails or some kind of announcement. 

Perhaps even having a shuttle set up to ferry students from the engineering school to UP would save students the hassle of making the drive themselves and finding parking. 

Though we disagree that the distance between the engineering campus and University Park is all that much, it is essential that the students taking classes not feel disenfranchised and out of the loop. All it would take is a bit of effort.

Headline: Tennis enjoys 'underdog' role on way to 7-3 start
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU tennis team entered this season as an unknown, but that will not last much longer if the Golden Panthers' success continues. It is that underdog role that has helped FIU achieve a 7-3 record through the season's first 10 matches.

"We're all fighters who don't give up. We're pumped up until the last point," Anneliese Rose, the team's top singles player, said. "There's a positive energy to this team."

After going 22-4 last year, advancing to the second round of the NCAA Regionals and jumping out to a 7-3 start this year, the 31st ranked team should no longer be hearing "F-I-who?" when playing at the national level.

"If you had told me at the beginning of the year that we would be 7-3 after the first 10 matches, I'd [have been] pretty happy," head coach Ronni Bernstein said. "We've had a few good wins versus some quality teams. We just have to keep it going and keep plugging away."

Part of this confidence comes from a Feb. 3 victory over Sun Belt Conference rival South Alabama. The Jaguars eliminated FIU from the conference tournament each of the past three years, but the Golden Panthers picked up a 4-3 win earlier this month.

"We usually lose to them, but this time it's a conference win that will definitely help us in the conference tournament," Christina Campana, Rose's partner on the 18th ranked doubles team, said.

Like the win over South Alabama, a loss had a similar effect on FIU. The Golden Panthers dropped a contest against the No. 3 ranked University of Florida on Feb. 8. FIU went on to win four of its next six matches.

"If we would have beaten Florida, I probably would have retired," Bernstein said jokingly. "But losing to the number three team in the nation doesn't hurt that much, because of strength of schedule."

FIU has secured wins over ranked teams such as Mississippi State, Southern Methodist and South Alabama. The team points to its underdog role as a positive.

"Being the underdog keeps us very loose. We are more focused and have more initiative to win," Rose said. "Coach Bernstein has played a very big role the past two years in getting us from round one to being on the map. We've beaten so many schools that never thought we would beat them."

Campana agrees.

"We don't care if we're the underdog or the unknown," Campana said. "We show them on the court. We feel good with no pressure and play more relaxed. We've got nothing to lose and a lot to win."

FIU's roster features players from eight different nations. The United States, Trinidad, Ecuador, Colombia, Hungary, Egypt, Australia and Chile are all represented.

"Having different players from different parts of the country and different parts of the world definitely contributes to team unity," Rose said. 

"Everyone on the team is hard working."

"We all get along great, care for each other and work hard," Mei Ly said. "It's like a little family."

The tennis team hopes that this family atmosphere, combined with its persistence pays off in May at the NCAA's.

FIU 1, Southern Illinois 0

Leslie Gillen scored an unearned run on a dropped third strike in the bottom of the second inning to give FIU a 1-0 win over Southern Illinois.

Gillen reached base to lead off the FIU second after she was hit by a pitch. Nicole Dubovik then sacrificed Gillen to second before a Marleah Staph goundout pushed her to third. 

With Crystal Boyer at the plate, SIU catcher Karrie Fortman dropped the ball on Boyer's third strike allowing Gillen to score from third.

Preston who started the game and took the loss. 

The only two hits for FIU came from Kelly Nicosia and Gillen.  Both hits were singles.

Headline: Three women's basketball players say farewell to home court
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
In what was the final home game of their collegiate careers, Gergana Slavtcheva, Cheryl Moody and Karen Roxborough felt like they had much more to accomplish.

FIU would only return home this season in the case that the team hosts a NCAA Tournament game.

"It really doesn't feel like the end, because we have a long way to go," Slavtcheva said.

Slavtcheva, who will leave FIU as one of the top players in the program's history, was talking about the women's basketball team's championship hopes that FIU will try to realize next week. 

The Golden Panthers (22-5, 12-1 Sun Belt) will travel to New Orleans with the aspiration of winning the school's first Sun Belt Conference championship. FIU ended the regular season with the best conference record. An NCAA Tournament berth will likely follow the conference tournament.

Slavtcheva said that the fact that her days of playing at Golden Panther Arena are over will "probably" affect her more when the team's season is concluded. The Bulgarian native, who has made her home in Miami for the past four years, will miss the success and her head coach most of all.

"I will remember how successful we were," Slavtcheva said. "We had a successful team."

The three seniors have been a part of four Golden Panther teams that have combined to go 81-35. The team's home court record over that time is 48-13.

Slavtcheva gives head coach Cindy Russo a lot of the credit for that success.

"Coach Russo is a great coach," Slavtcheva said. "[Leaving her] will probably hurt me the most."

For Russo, the feeling is mutual.

"We're definitely going to miss them," Russo said. "They're not only three good basketball players; they're also some of the best young women that we've had. They're not the only ones, but they are definitely [three] of the top."

The seniors hope that they can prolong their season by winning.

"It has been a dream season for us," Moody said. "I agree with Gergana that we still have a long way to go this season."

The experience of the last four years was better than was ever expected, according to Slavtcheva.

"Sometimes, I think its too good to be true," Slavtcheva siad. "But it is [true]."

&nbsp;
In their final game at Golden Panther Arena, Gergana Slavtcheva and Cheryl Moody made their performances memorable by leading the women's basketball team over Arkansas State 73-61, in front of 609 fans on Wednesday.

Prior to the game, Slavtcheva, Moody and fellow senior Karen Roxborough were honored for their time at FIU. 

"We're definitely going to miss them," head coach Cindy Russo said.

The win over ASU (12-15, 6-8 Sun Belt) was the eighth straight for FIU (22-5, 12-1) and avenged the team's only conference loss. The win improved the Golden Panthers' record on the team's home court to 13-2.

Slavtcheva led all scorers with 22 points on 7 of 11 shooting from the field. She also grabbed five rebounds and had five assists. Moody had 19 rebounds and 13 points for her 18th double-double of the season. Roxborough started her first game, in the place of Cormisha Cotton, and scored two points in six minutes.

FIU took control of the game early and looked as if they would cruise to a victory. The three seniors combined to score 12 of the first 14 Golden Panther points as FIU jumped out to a 14-10 lead.

A Mandy Shafer three-pointer from the left wing with 11:09 remaining in the first half started a 41-10 Golden Panther run that would last unitl five minutes into the second half. Slavtcheva scored 11 points during this span.

The Golden Panthers' largest lead of the night came when Silvia Mesa scored in the paint off a Slavtcheva assist, and FIU led 55-32.

Arkansas State would continue to fight throughout the second half and closed within nine points on four different occasions, thanks to a 21-6 run. Rae-Ann Smith and Chiquita Tucker scored 17 of the Lady Indians' points during the eight minute time span.

"I think we let up a little in the end,"  Russo said. "I think we had control of the game though."

FIU held off the ASU comeback in the final two minutes, converting seven of nine free-throws. 

Cormisha Cotton added 15 points to the Golden Panthers' effort.

FIU 70, Arkansas-Little Rock 55

Slavthceva again led the team with a game-high 20 points and 11 rebounds. Moody grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds and scored 17 points for her 19th double-double of the season.

With three minutes remaining, UALR closed FIU's lead to 61-55. FIU would then go on a 9-0 run to close out the game.

Next up

FIU will travel to New Orleans for the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. The No. 1 seed in the East Division will have a first round bye and will play a second round game at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday.

Headline: Men's basketball loses seventh straight
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
A week's worth of preparation served no purpose when the FIU men's basketball team took the court at Arkansas State Thursday night. And the upperclassmen's lack of support was especially noticeable at Arkansas Little-Rock on Saturday.

FIU (10-19, 4-10 Sun Belt), ranked last in the Sun Belt Eastern Division, finished the regular season with two losses, taking the losing streak to seven games. Head coach Donnie Marsh was left with the need to insert new players into the game in Little Rock, to see who can help in the SBC tournament first round opener versus North Texas this Friday.

FIU lost 54-64 versus the Arkansas State Indians (14-15) and 54-79 to the Trojans (17-10).

ALR 79, FIU 54

Ranked 26th in the nation in field goal percentage, ALR continued the trend, shooting 60 percent in game, which was started off with back-to-back three-point shots by Nick Zachery, the game's leading scorer, and Mark Green, who had 21 and 16 points, respectively.

On the other hand, FIU's leading scorer Taurance Johnson was kept to just one basket and five turnovers in the first half. It was Rodrigo Viegas who came through for the Golden Panthers on the weekend, scoring 19 points with five assists and three steals Saturday.

"The team was real physical and they banged him, doubled him," Marsh said of Johnson. "He now knows that come off-season, he has to get into the weight room and get stronger."

Right before half time, FIU went on a 11-0 run, cutting the Trojans' lead to one off a three-pointer by Slavcho Slavtchev. Together with Javier Cuenca, they saw more minutes than in any other game this season. Freshman guard David Luber, who had not seen any action in the last six games, also contributed.

"I think they're tired of coming up short. No freshman has been in this situation before," Marsh said of his freshman starters Johnson and Carlos Morban, who together with Viegas have been left to carry the load. "We have been truggling with the upperclassmen's performance."

"It's disappointing. You'd think they'd come with enough experience but individually it hasn't been there," Marsh said. 

Marsh had to resort to Luber at guard once junior Fab Fisher was unable to help in the second half. Chris Carter and Haven Jackson were unable to score baskets early in the game and saw few minutes later on. Nic Novakovic was unavailable against the Trojans after suffering a hip flexor strain in practice. He is expected to be ready for the Sun Belt tournament.

ALR went on an 11-0 run, marked with three back-to-back FIU turnovers. FIU had 2 3total.

"We're trying to get past where we are [after the ALR loss]," Marsh said. "We have to put the regular season behind us."

Arkansas State 64, FIU 54

With Morban slowly becoming the team's mood-setter, things didn't look well from the start for the Golden Panthers, who opened up in Jonesboro, AR, with a missed Morban dunk. FIU went 0 of 11 from the field in the first 10 minutes.

Morban, who had 13 points, scored the first basket for FIU midway through the first half. By then, the Indians led by 11 points. Johnson was held to seven points. The forward contributed elsewhere, grabbing eight rebounds, four assists and three steals. Viegas led the team with 17 points.

"Taurance is our lead scorer and their game plan may have been to take him out of the fix," Marsh said. "[But] right now we depend on everybody. We need everybody."

Although FIU recorded 20 field goals (37 percent) to ASU's 16 (39 percent), the Indians were at the line twice as much as the Golden Panthers, scoring 24 points from the free throw stripe.

ASU's seniors Kolin Weaver, Jason Jennings and Nick Rivers, who returned from a leg injury and whose early three point basket in the game served as the Indians' motivating factor, combined for 37 points.

Next up

The FIU men's basketball team will play Western Division fourth seed North Texas on Friday at 12:30 pm in the first round game of the SBC tournament.

Headline: Wilson voted Sun Belt Most Outstanding Female Track Performer
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
FIU's Vronique Wilson was voted the Most Outstanding Female Track Performer after the sprinter won both the 55-meter and 200-meter dashes at the Sun Belt Conference Indoor Track & Field Championships in Murfreesboro, Tenn.

Wilson set a new SBC meet record in the 200m with a time of 23.72 that also provisionally qualified her for the NCAA Indoor Championships at the University of Arkansas in two weeks. The time broke the old meet mark of 23.84 set in 1999 by former FIU All-American and Olympic medal-winner Tayna Lawrence and was just two-hundredths of a second off NCAA automatic qualifying.

She captured the 55-meter dash championship with a time of 7.01.

Freshman Jamare Clarington also provisionally qualified for the NCAAs when he won the men's 55-meter hurdles, tying the meet record of 7.31 set last year by Middle Tennessee's Jasper Demps who wound up third this time. Clarington also scored points for the Golden Panthers with a fourth-place finish in the 55-meter dash (6.48).

Host Middle Tennessee came away with both the men and women's team championships. 

The Blue Raider women scored a league record 138 points, followed by North Texas (81) and FIU (70½). On the men's side, MT notched 126 points, ahead of Western Kentucky (100½). The FIU men finished seventh (48).

Other all-conference performances were turned in by Golden Panther women's 4x400-meter relay team of Wilson, Anita Edwards, Thera Johnson and Alexia Dean who finished third (3:50.00) and Michelle Lennox and Jessica Ghersi who were second and third respectively in the women's pole vault.

Men's all-conference recognition went to FIU's second-place distance medley relay team of Luiz Prestes, Greg Johnson, Sean Prospect and Elliott Mason.

Just missing league honors were junior Rebecca Rodriguez who was fourth in the women's 3000-meter run (10:20.10) and her brother Eddy Rodriguez with a fourth-place showing in the men's 3000 meters (8:47.18). Prestes also ran fourth with a 4:16.48 men's mile.

Subheadline: No. 25 Golden Panthers suffer season's first losing streak at Homestead Challenge
Author: Alex Braswell, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After disposing of Bethune-Cookman on Wednesday 14-5, 25th-ranked FIU lost to Miami and beat Kansas State at the Homestead Challenge.  

FIU went 1-2 losing to the Hurricanes and suffered a loss to Lipscomb for their first two game losing streak.

FIU 9, Kansas State 3

FIU (9-3) beat Kansas State (4-3) 9-3 to win their only game in Homestead. Derek DeCarlo (2-0) pitched six innings, allowing six hits and one run with six strikeouts. 

FIU extended their lead to 4-0 in the bottom of the fourth on back-to-back doubles by Alex Ansoleaga, who went 4-5 with three RBI, and Adam Summerall. Ansoleaga' hit brought in Dean Adams. Summerall later scored on an error by the Wildcat's Tim Foley.

FIU scored four more runs in the bottom of the eighth. The last two runs were scored on a wild pitch  and an error by Ty Soot. Kansas State put up two last runs in their last inning to make the final score 9-3.

"We were better focused to come out and play," head coach Danny Price said. This is a club that will learn when we have a setback to gather yourself and move on."

Lipscomb 8, FIU 6

FIU suffered its first two-game losing streak of the season as they fell to Lipscomb (2-7) 8-6 in 14 innings, the second longest game in FIU history.

In the top of the 14th, the Bisons scored the go-ahead run. Ryan Abrams, who went 5 for 6 with four RBI, was walked. Mark Candler put down a sacrifice bunt and Abrams scored what was to be the game winner. FIU relief pitcher Alan Mendez overthrew to Dean Adams. Jeremy George then scored on a double play to make it 8-6.

FIU would not score until the bottom of the fifth when Solomon Frieder doubled to bring in Dean Adams and Orlando Garcia. Frieder would then advance to third on a passed ball and score when Diaz singled up the middle and FIU took a 3-2 lead.

FIU would score two more runs in the bottom of the seventh when Daniel Bustamante hit a two RBI single to left field to bring in Garcia and Frieder.

The Golden Panthers led 6-2 going into the ninth inning, but the Bisons never gave up, scoring four runs on the usually reliable reliever Luis Gazitua to tie the game at 6-6. 

"It's a very disappointing loss," Price said. "They played better than we did and they wanted to win more than we did."

FIU 2, UM 6

The second meeting between cross-town rivals  was nothing like their first meeting several weeks ago, as this time UM took the victory 6-2 at the Homestead Challenge in front of 3,904 fans.

FIU starter, Josh Banks (2-1), who had held UM to one hit and struck out 11 in the first meeting Feb. 6, was hit early this time around, allowing four runs on six hits before he was replaced by Carlos Sanchez in the bottom of the fifth.

Javy Rodriguez led off with a single to left field and then stole second and third base and stole home. 

"It was a bang-bang play," catcher Tommy Dueñas said. "Javy got a good jump of Banks. It was a tough call for the umpire, but I though he [Javy] was out."

FIU would take a 2-1 lead in the top of the fourth inning, Skip Adams' double hit brought in Bernie Gonzalez and Dean Adams. The lead was short-lived as UM came back with three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning to recapture the lead. Jim Burt doubled to left field. The ball hit the top of the left field wall but bounced back into play as Danny Matienzo and Kevin Mannix scored. Two batters later, Hass Pratt hit a double to bring in Burt for a 4-2 lead.

Matienzo would hit a solo homerun one inning later to make it 5-2. UM would score their last run in the bottom of the seventh inning as Matienzo reached base on a single then would later score on an error by relief pitcher Derek Taylor.

FIU threatened several times during the course of the game to score more runs but they would always end up rallying with two outs in an inning including abases loaded situation in the second inning. 

"The difference was that we lost," Price said about the difference between this game and the game, which FIU won 7-1 in Feb. "We have to keep our cool and just move on."

Headline: BBC metered spaces part of campus parking problem
Author: Catherine Perez, Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The aspect of parking availability at FIU is of great continuing concern to students and rightfully so. Being that I am a recent transfer to this university I had no idea that it was such a problem. 

However, I learned quite quickly that arriving just a few minutes later than usual can mean the difference between being able to park relatively close to the academic buildings and having to make a long trek across campus. Like most human beings, there are times when unavoidable factors can cause delays.  Traffic, accidents, and those drivers who should have never gotten their licenses but yet seem to abound everywhere are just a few excellent examples that come to mind.  

In these situations, it is vital that we engage in relaxation techniques so as not to exhibit the familiar signs of road rage that have become all too prevalent. In those agonizing moments in which you traverse the parking lot in search of just one unoccupied space, it is impossible to not feel extreme frustration.

On BBC alone there are rows of them in the lots by the library and even more in the other lots by the academic buildings that basically go unused.  

In all the time I have attended this university I have never seen those spaces put to much use.  In fact, each morning I drive passed them and wonder why in the world no faithful student is able to use them.  

The probable argument is that the spaces are for visitors or any individuals who do not attend the university on a regular basis. Another factor may be the revenue generated from the meters.  But is it truly necessary to have so many when the number of visitors each day cannot possibly amount to the same number of spaces set aside for them?   

All students are aware that professors do not look too highly on those students who arrive late. It can also be very difficult to make up for any information presented in the beginning of class when one is not able to be present.  In fact, I can recall one particular day in which I came face to face with the real severity of the problem.  

That morning I began my commute to the university as usual.  My eyes on the road, my ears in tune with 93.1(Miami's real party station), and my mind on the busy day ahead; I continued on my way. However, once I reached a critical part in my commute, I was greeted by a grisly site. In front of me was a stomach-turning accident.  Two cars had collided with each other, leaving not much of anything in their wake.  

Needless to say, it was evident to all of us caught in the traffic jam that we would be stationed in our cars for an indefinite amount of time.  My grave concern as I sat in my car and as the minutes ticked by only intensified as more time passed.  

I finally reached the BBC's parking lot.  My worst fear came true when I realized I had to spend even more time that I could not afford looking for a space. I had an idea that I admit now was not one of my brightest.  I took a chance and parked in a metered space, knowing I did not have any quarters on me at the time.  After rushing to class, and enduring the annoyed look of my professor, the remainder of the class flew by.  

On my way back to my car, I said a silent prayer hoping that my harmless little parking violation had gone unnoticed.  Unfortunately, it had not.  In fact, there was a yellow parking violation ticket waiting for me on the windshield of my car. It was then that I began to question the true necessity of the many metered spaces. If there is such a parking scarcity, why is that there are so many metered spaces?

Moreover, if these spaces largely go unused then how much money can the university truly be receiving from them?  My suggestion is that at least some of those spaces be designated as student spaces since we seem to be the ones most greatly affected by the dire insufficiency in parking.  

Honestly what is the logic behind having unsued parking available when there is such a great need for a solution to the parking shortage?

Headline: Raw Deal meaning lost on ignorant Miami crowd
Author: Anaite Lopez, Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Like most students, I had been caught up with the commotion regarding the highly controversial documentary "Raw Deal: A Question of Consent." The prick in everyone's mind was the warning of the explicit sexual nature of the film.  

Everyone knew it was about a rape and for the most part, it was the actual witnessing of a rape scene that may have been the major motivating factor for many who saw the film. Very few (I would even go as far as to say none) knew exactly what they were about to endure. 

I recall the day of the screening and the anticipation amongst the crowd. The majority of people walked in to the auditorium murmuring, anxiously awaiting to be disturbed and shocked by the sexual "pornographic" content of the film.  

Most expected a straight-out textbook rape scene with a victim and a criminal and lots of racy footage. Their expectations could not be further from the truth.  If rape was the motive for viewing the film for the audience, rape would become the reason why many walked out.  

Billy Corben's  "Raw Deal: A Question of Consent" is not only about a sexual rape, it is  about a personal questioning of oneself, of the society one lives in, of the moral, political and ethical codes we abide to. Sadly, I discovered that the majority of FIU students were not prepared for this mental discourse. I walked in expecting to be appalled by the film's sexual content, but unfortuneatly, I ended up feeling more appalled by the audience's reaction. 
The nature of the film itself gives no answers or straight-out revelations. The movie merely asks the question, on February 1999 did an actual rape crime take place at a University of Florida frat party?  Billy Corben presents the argument as objectively as possible and gives every side to the story with the actual footage of the rape scene and allows the viewer to witness and judge. 

There is no manipulation on any part nor has the director sided with any particular verdict. It is entirely contingent on the viewers and their personal beliefs.  

The events are as follows: an exotic dancer is hired by a fraternity to attend one of their events. She is highly intoxicated and throughout the night engages in some sexual activity with some of the frat boys. 
All of the events are videotaped. The dancer at moments appears vulgar, seductive, "trashy."  She slaps her private parts, lures the boys with sexual talk, humps them while buck naked, etc.  
However, in my opinion, at no point does she agree to sexual intercourse with any of the guys.  There is clear-cut evidence of her rejecting any form of penetration and one of the guys coercing her into having it. At one point he goes as far as to choke her.  

Of course at this point, after witnessing her scandalous sexual behavior on tape, no one including the police and the audience themselves, are willing to accept that she in fact had been raped.  In their eyes, even if she was raped,  she deserved it.   

It is she who put herself in that compromising position. Afterall, many might wonder, how could a woman behave that way and then have the audacity to say she was raped? I distinctly remember the laughter that overcame the audience after the victim admitted to just wanting to go home to her children during the rape.   Apparently no one could believe that a stripper, could be a mother.  Even women were laughing, which was unbelievable to me.   If someone doesn't behave according to moral and social standards, does that make a person any less human?

Do we have any right to chastise anyone for behaving contrary to social norms?  How do we justify going as far as to take vengeance on them, on a woman for being sexually liberated, for being a "whore," to jail her, the victim, instead of the criminal? 
Let us not forget, in this male-structured society it is the woman who must take all precautions in order to avoid being raped.  If she does not, then she is at fault for putting herself in that position.  But should there not be a general rule that says "Hey men, you shouldn't rape a woman no matter what vulnerable position she is in?"   

Unfortunately, the inappropriate bouts of laughter, the constant idle chatter during such disturbing scenes, and the ludicrous comments during the director's question and answer session proved to me that not even the most liberal minded students can separate from society's grasp, at least not in Miami. 

The most commonly asked question to the director was: "What do you feel is your responsibility in presenting this film?" The most vital significance to this film is the director's objectivivity in presenting the argument.	

Isn't subjectivity, letting his own perspective intefere, exactly what he's trying to avoid?  And yet, the audience bombarded him with questions like that. Many may also wonder if there is an actual social significance to the film or if it is just sensationalist. 

Sensationalism?  Doesn't anyone get the point? If this type of reaction is, like the director felt, only a reaction from a narrow-minded, conservative Miami crowd, then clearly this is just an example that we have many other social issues to deal with and maybe I should get a one way ticket out of town.

Headline: Winter Olympics tarnished by controversy
Author: Heather C. McCalla, Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
There's just something about the Winter Olympics. There's a certain magical aura that surrounds it: the skiing, the bobsledding, the snowboarding and, of course, who can forget the scandals associated with the ice skating competitions? 

As a child, I can recall vividly watching the opening ceremonies. I would sit on the floor, way too close to the television, trying to get as close to the action as possible. I remember getting those warm fuzzy feelings all over. I remember watching those athletes in awe of the talent that their hard work and dedication had created through intense training. I remember wishing that I had one ounce of the grace that those beautiful figure skaters possessed on the rink. 

I recently heard criticism about figure skating on 94.9 ZETA. I believe it was Toast who declared that this sport was still in the Olympics merely because of the scandals involved. As a fan of the sport, I found this ridiculous. What, is figure skating not challenging enough now? Try merely standing on skates; believe me, you'll appreciate what it must take to land a triple axle. 

So what do you propose we replace it with? The grand event of curling, which is nothing more that shuffleboard on ice? Hey, Toast, learn how to do a triple Lutz. Then we'll talk.

I can't deny, though, that the games have been somewhat tainted.  What happened to the Olympics, the great sporting event I have come to know and love?

This year, perhaps more than any other, the once beautiful sport of figure skating has been corrupted, not that it was entirely pure to begin with. In the 1994 Winter Olympics, the Nancy ("Why me?  Why me?") Kerrigan and Tonya Harding incident showed us just how intense the competition could be. 

Although there was always some suspicion of foul judging in figure skating, nothing brought out the ugly side of Olympic competition more than the now infamous judging controversy in the pairs event this year. Two skaters who worked so hard were tossed aside because of what, tradition? Because the Russians held the title for some 60 years? That's not exactly the kind of tradition I think of when I looked back on my childhood memories.

Now, I know the Canadians were awarded the gold medal to be shared with the Russians. Although most would say that was only fair, I think it sets a terrible precedent. Now everyone will cry "unfair judging" when they feel they didn't get the scores they deserve, like the Lithuanian ice dancing pair. 

Hey, I sympathize; I am sure it's not easy to work for years, spending hours upon hours in a day, perfecting a five minute routine only to have it tossed aside by some guy who didn't like your outfit or some other minute detail. At times disappointment accompanies sports, and it is those times when you just have to grin and bear it and move on.

I think that the Olympic games carry a sense of tradition. For me, and hopefully many others, it holds a sense of pride. 

After the tragedy of the past year, I think I was searching for these games to rekindle some sort of inner child that wants to believe everything will be OK. But sadly enough, the Olympics end and reality remains. 

I am in no way saying that watching the United States win numerous medals does not make me proud. Nor am I saying that Salt Lake City didn't do a wonderful job entertaining with their surreal opening ceremony. It's just that the Olympic games seem to have lost their luster. Sadly, once something wonderful is scarred, it is almost impossible to fix.  The inner child in me certainly will never see it in the same light.

Losers

Russia: Threatening to pull out of the Olympics because you're not happy with the outcome is just plain sad.   We call that being a sore loser. Lucky for you, you are responsible for Vodka, otherwise we'd boycott you too.

Queen of the Damned: How creepy is it to have Aaliyah playing a vampire from beyond the grave? Unfortunately, the boost her death will give the movie will probably encourage the making of more movies based on bad Anne Rice novels.

Michelle Kwan: You know what they say, history repeats itself.  Time to give up your Olympic dream. I guess its just easier for 16 year olds to land triple axles.

Subheadline: Readers divided on musical merits of Creed
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

Two weeks ago, The Beacon featured an article, by Alex Segura, in which Creed was once again lambasted as a "Christian" band with a "lack of talent" and as being an "establishment-friendly band." It is for these reasons that Alternative Press Magazine named them "Rock's Most Misunderstood Band." Unfortunately, those who would chastise the band usually make it painfully obvious just how little they know about the band or their music. 

The most common misconception that goes along with Creed is that they are a Christian band. Creed does not like this title, nor do they agree with it. They confess that they are all Christians, but they do not consider that that's what constitutes a "Christian" band. According to lead singer Scott Stapp, Christian bands have agendas. Stapp says Creed has a message, not an agenda. It seems that a lot of the misconceptions stem from their lyrics. 

One song that is often cited by those who would label them as the new voices of Christian youth is "What's This Life For." Stapp, inspired by a friend who committed suicide wrote the song for their My Own Prison album. In the song, Stapp proclaims, "We all live under the reign of one king." However, the band faced criticism from Christian groups for that same song because of his lyrics, "We don't have to settle no goddamn score." 

The band actually went on the offensive on a radio broadcast just before the release of their sophomore album, Human Clay, by telling the Christian caller to RockLine that they hate the holier-than-thou attitude that only they will attain salvation of many in the religious right. Creed addresses spiritual issues on their albums, among other things. No "rock fan" attacks Robert Plant for writing "Stairway to Heaven" because it deals with spiritual issues. Why should Creed be attacked for the same?
 
Segura also claimed that the members of Creed were not talented. 
Again, further evidence that those who would attempt to attack them know little about them. Creed's guitarist, Mark Tremonti, has been the of focus of the guitar-playing world ever since 1997. In fact, he was voted the best rock guitarist in both 2000 and 2001 by Guitar World Magazine.

He has been recognized as a talented player to the extent that Paul Reed Smith Guitars, often recognized as the highest quality guitars available, issued the Mark Tremonti Signature Model. Their music has already won them numerous awards, from VH1's My Music Awards to the Grammy's. They are one of the most talented bands around, plain and simple.

Another claim that often goes along with Creed-bashing is that they are safe, that they are establishment-friendly. On their debut album, Creed included a song called, "One." In it, Creed addresses the presence of racism and attacks the government's attempts to deal with it.  

Creed takes their music seriously, as they do with music in general. What's wrong with that? In a time where music fans call for substance, for the public executions of the members of the Backstreet Boys, it seems odd that we would attack the members of Creed for providing this substance. The Alternative Press also reported that they once picked a fight with the members of *Nsync for not having the guts to write their own songs.

Granted, Creed has it's faults. Scott Stapp is arrogant and pretty conceited. But again, he's not the first lead singer of a band to have that trait. When Jim Morrison had this trait, people called it by a different name: stage presence. However, no matter how you feel about the members of Creed, their music speaks for itself.

Creed is a band that has it's roots in hard rock, that obviously puts a lot of effort into its songs, both musically and lyrically. Instead, Segura would have us listen to old Ramones' albums, listening to the true lyrical ingenuity of Joey, "Hey, ho, let's go!" 

Maybe Creed isn't the most anti-establishment band, and I even wish that they would take a lesson from Rage Against the Machine. Still, Creed is one of the best bands out right now. I am glad to see that rock is beginning to regain the throne in music, rescuing it from the stranglehold of boy bands and pretty little blonde girls.

To the editor:

Your article on Creed was right on the money.  Their music makes me physically ill.  When I stumble upon one of their putrid songs, I get nauseous.  I have been trying to figure out why they are so popular and all I can come up with is the fact that most people are human cattle.  They don't even know what they like, they just like what they're supposed to like, in this case, Creed.  I've gotten into many arguments with Creedlodytes after informing them that they have horrendous taste in music.

I'm sure for every letter like mine you'll get five from Cock-Rock loving idiots trying to defend the music they think they love so much.  I imagine you laughing at them as I know I would.

Headline: In Our View: Construction should focus on classrooms
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
According to the university expansion program taking shape around campus, by Fall 2002 students will see a new Health and Life Sciences building, Executive Center and dormitory hall rising from the construction areas.

Barring any major weather setbacks, the buildings will soon add a new look to the FIU landscape and pose the question: What's next?

Each new building will have a significant role in the coming years, but as the university expands, it is vital they look at a pressing need that is only partially filled: classrooms. 

The Health and Life Sciences building resolves some classroom size problems, but its focus is on one specific type of student. 

The university should by all means continue its expansion, especially in the area of student dormitories. 

With an increased number of students living on campus, FIU will inch closer to becoming a more traditional university, which seems to be the goal of the administration. 

But with an increase in students on campus and a continued rise in student enrollment in general, the already visible classroom size problem will only get worse.

There are other possible solutions. Instead of continuing to increase enrollment, the university could become more selective, which seems to be where things are headed. 

But regardless of that, new classrooms are still essential to continue the university's expansion.

Building expansion seems to be moving forward with a definite plan, but with space at such a premium, it is vital for FIU to set aside some of that space not only for student parking and dormitories, but classrooms. 

Unless FIU can move out and purchase more land adjacent to the current campus, the university has to work as if this area is as large as the campus can get.

Since space is limited, and we seem to be building up instead of out, the focus of the next wave of construction should look forward more than a few years. It should work under the assumption that the campus will not get any bigger.

Headline: Haitian concert closes BBC Pan-African celebrations
Author: Neressa Joseph and Marlynne Boyer, Contributing Writers
&nbsp;
Hundreds of students danced into the night with the music of the Haitian "compas-singing" band T-Vice on Feb. 21, at the Wolfe University Center Ballroom on the Biscayne Bay Campus.

As the grand finale for the 2002 Pan-African Celebrations, the concert was the first in the history of FIU to feature a Haitian group. 

T-Vice consists of Roberto Martino, 26 on guitar and lead vocals, Reynaldo Martino, 23 on maestro, Gerald Kebreau, 30 on bass, and James Cardozo, 29, also on vocals. The group's manager Jessie Al-Khal is Roberto's and Reynaldo's mother.

"It's a beautiful thing for me…I'm more than honored to play for FIU," Roberto Martino said.  "We just arrived from Haiti and we were supposed to be on a three week vacation, but we decided to play for FIU instead."

Brochner Louidor, 21, Pan-African Celebration Chair, said he felt it was a good idea to put on a Haitian concert at FIU and advertised at the Haitian radio stations Touchem Douce 90.1 FM and Radio Carnivale 1020 AM.  
Louidor had no qualms about asking T-Vice to come and play for FIU because he felt the concert was a great opportunity to promote cultural diversity on campus.

"If you don't embrace your culture in a society where there are so many ethnicities, you lose it," Louidor said.

"When you get a big group like T-Vice, people will come," Louidor said.
T-Vice, inspired by Roberto and Reynaldo's father Pierrot Al-Khal, started when Reynaldo, also known as the "baby" of the band, was only 12 years old. 

T-Vice branched off from Pierrot Al-Khal's band Top Vice, which played Haitian music for the "Old School" Haitian generation.

"I'm familiar with the 'Old School' generation where old Haitian bands like Top-Vice and Tabou Combo were famous," High School teacher Dannielle Carmelle, 24, said. "The Haitian culture is trying to combine both schools – the 'Old School' and the 'New School.'  T-Vice is from the "New School." 

The concert was a good opportunity for the Haitian community to publicly enjoy their culture. 

At the concert, the Haitian Student Organization (HSO) sold Choucoune – Haitian sodas – and food such as rice and grio – pork.
Student Kalryck Powell, 21, originally from Jamaica came to the event with some friends from Africa. 

"I came for the experience, to learn more about the culture, and to look at the pretty girls."  Kalryck said.

Tyrone Moorehead, 27, from St.Croix said he found out about the event from his Bahamian friends. 

"It was very nice and I will come again to other Haitian events," Moorehead said.

Roberto Martino said that they are known all over the world.

"We are also known in Europe.  We play in Paris, Switzerland, French Guiana and lots of French-speaking countries," said Roberto, who is fluent in Creole, French and English.

The T-Vice concert was the final event for the 2002 Pan-African Celebrations that lasted from Feb. 11 to Feb. 21. 

Other events included the Urban Hair & Fashion Show, sponsored by Student Programming Council and Panther Power.  
The hair and fashion show featured FIU students modeling designs by Steppin N Style and sporting Hairstyles by Jacques Ahead of Time Beauty Salon.

Jazz Soiree featuring Haitian artwork held by HSO as part of the Sa Kap Fet Festival, and Pan-African celebrations.

Headline: New buildings done by summer
Author: Rasheed Cordero, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Keeping with the expansion program currently underway at the university, the Health and Life Sciences building, the Executive Center, and an unnamed dormitory hall are all scheduled to open by the beginning of the Fall 2002 semester. 

 "These buildings are three of the major capital improvement programs right now," Assistant Vice President of Business and Finance and Facilities Management Victor Citarella said. "[They cost] about $250,000." 

Barring any major delays, such as weather or other unforeseen conditions, the buildings should be done by the summer, with students and staff expected to occupy them by the fall.

The Health and Life Sciences building is located north of the Graham Center and east of the Owa Ehan building. It is a two-phase project that will accommodate students and faculty, with the second building currently in the planning and development stage, said Robert Griffith, associate director of Facilities Management. 

Funding for the construction came from "PECO (Public Education Capital Outlay) state funding.  That's the fund source that we get for most academic buildings," said Griffith.

Another building under construction, the Executive Center, will have some unique aspects.

"It's being built right now just south of the PC building, west of the parking garages one and two."  Citarella said.  "It's a five-story facility; [and] it was built with monies assigned by the FIU foundation."

This building will house the new offices of President Modesto Maidique and other top university officials.  Citarella also mentioned an interesting aspect of this new facility: tenants will pay rent to the FIU foundation, which will then pay the mortgage on the building.  Once the mortgage is paid in full, the building becomes the property of the university.  

With the surge in enrollment and the university expecting a two to three percent growth in the number of students in the next five years, a new dorm was also included in the expansion plans. 

"[The dorm is] being built right next to the existing towers" Citarella said.  "And it has three five to six story buildings with a total of 348 beds. 

That's supposed to be open by the summer, so that the students coming in the fall semester of 2002 will have additional facilities where they can stay at."

Funding for the dorm came from the State of Florida in the form of revenue bonds, which will then be paid back by the students' fees for staying in the dorm.  The estimated cost of construction for the dorm is $19 million.

Design and architecture for all three new facilities was contracted to Harper Partners, while the actual physical construction contract was awarded to the Turner Construction Company.  

With the addition of these three new structures, an area of major concern is parking.  Keeping in mind the expected number of cars that will soon fill FIU's already-congested roadways, the facilities management department has recently awarded a consulting contract to Walker Consultants, who Citarella said, "are a firm that specializes in designing and building parking garages all over the United States."

Once the plans are in place, construction will begin on two parking garages, which will hold approximately 1,400 cars each.  One location has already been decided: the intersection of SW 8th Street and 109th Avenue.  The other garage is slated to be built somewhere close to the Golden Panther Arena, although a final location has not yet been selected, Citarella said.

Finally, with all the increased activity and students, security and safety are one of the top priorities for the administration.

 "Security has become a major issue on campus after the Sept. 11 situation," Citarella said.  "We have cameras in different locations in different buildings, all in public areas."

Author: Hans and Jackie
&nbsp;
Q: How come there hasn't been a Question Time in weeks? You've deprived me of that insightful goodness that I crave weekly like Cuban crackers covered in a delicious mixture of peanut butter and heroin. Hans, Jackie, I love you! Come back, please! I want to be hugged by your philosophical repartee and tender arms the color of crayola crayons.
Curious Moron 

H: The state imposes a limit on the amount of fun a newspaper can offer. We were about to exceed our quota, hence it was deemed necessary that we slow down for a while. That, and all the hate mail kept us on the low down for a while. 
J:  Because everything that is important to you suffers from budget cut-itis, including us. Also, remind me to issue a restraining order against you, you freak!

Q: My boyfriend told me he had this wonderful dream in which we made passionate love, (according to him, the best he ever had). I was really kind of flattered until he happened to mention that, actually, in his dream I was a hot Chinese slut with the body of Pamela Anderson and the head of Nicole Kidman. Does this even make sense?
Shayna S.

H: It only makes sense if she also had the hands of Charlize Theron and the stamina of a Swedish hair-dresser. If she did, then I think I've bumped into this chick in my dreams as well.
J:  Yeah, it does make sense girl!  I've had a dream like that, only it was a black vampire stripper with the body of Kid Rock and the head of Tom Cruise. 

Q: Every time the Academy Awards comes around I wonder: Who's Oscar? Does he have a last name?
Movie Buff

H: His last name is Mayer and he's a Wiener.
J:  He's a little man, just like Hans phrased it, who paid the Academy a lot of money and in return they made trophies that looks nothing like the real Oscar. Wilde, that is.

Headline: Trashy "Queen of the Damned" sucks fun out of vampire genre
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
"Queen of the Damned" is a sequel of sorts to the infinitely superior "Interview with the Vampire." I'm reluctant to call it a sequel because it's not being billed as one, and it is simply in bad taste to imply that this sucking waste of CGI is in any way related to the very decent vampire vehicle that starred Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, Kirsten Dunst and Antonio Banderas. It's like calling gonorrhea a sequel to love.

All the original actors are gone, the original director is gone, the original sense of style is gone. You could say the two movies share some of the same characters, but then again, there are no such things as "characters" in "Queen of the Damned." There are bad actors with outrageous accents licking their lips and trying real hard to appear intensely sexual, but no characters. When you take the dizzying plunge and cast Stuart Townsend instead of Tom Cruise as your main character, the vampire Lestat, you know you're in trouble. Who the hell is Stuart Townsend anyway?

Lestat wakes up in the present after a sleep of many decades to promptly start a Goth-rock band that we are meant to think is wildly daring even though they have a keyboardist that looks a lot like Cindi Lauper. Armed solely with his heroin chic looks and his laughable sense of lyrical composition, Lestat's band makes it to the top of the charts. (You know they made it because in true Hollywood movie fashion, there's a random shot of MTV News reporting on how great Lestat's music is.)

Lestat has a big plan that is so moronic you end up feeling sorry for him. He wants to become a big rock star and cryptically give away secret vampire hang-outs through his songs, in order to annoy other vampires. Never mind that "cryptically giving away secrets" smacks of the oxymoron; never mind that it takes a crack team of investigators known as the Talamasca to find out there are secret messages in his lyrics in the first place; never mind that even their discovery is so far-fetched that no reasonable vampire could take Lestat's songs as a serious threat to their anonymity.

Lestat intends for every vampire in the world to attend his giant concert (apparently, it's a one-night-only tour), to demonstrate their hate… or something like that. What he intends to do when they actually get there is never quite clear, and luckily we are saved from finding out by the appearance of Akasha (Aaliyah, in her final role), which is a relief because Aaliyah is the only remotely recognizable human being in this movie, even though she's the Queen of the Vampires.

I am almost tempted to say complimentary things about Aaliyah, given her tragic death and all, but the fact is that her snarling Queen makes her role in "Romeo Must Die" seem Oscar-worthy. Well, maybe Golden-Globe-worthy. She's still the best thing here.

"Queen of the Damned" condenses two of the novels in Anne Rice's wildly popular "Vampire Chronicles" series, but does it with all the elegance of a Reader's Digest abridgment. It's one of those movies where there's always a lot happening but nothing really happens; where wonderful special effects keep being thrown your way merely as a way to keep you from walking out or dozing off. You can almost hear the desperate whine in each and every frame: "Please don't go! I know I have no story to tell or people to care about, but look: I've been edited in real nifty fashion and my soundtrack is so loud, you couldn't possibly fall asleep!"

At least the movie is visually enticing; it gives you things to look at even though it makes it hard for you to care about them. And on the plus side, the plot is always too incoherent to be predictable. The final showdown in particular is a marvel of ineptitude. These vampires suck blood from their victims; they suck IQ points off the audience. They just plain suck. Poor Anne Rice. She must be rolling in her coffin. Yeah, I know she's not dead, but she probably sleeps in a coffin anyway.

Headline: All Access: Bonus tracks make CDs go bust
Author: Alex Segura, Jr. / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Now with two new bonus tracks! Featuring never-released demos! With a FREE interview CD!

The multi-colored stickers jump out as you browse down the alphabetized CD racks. They're impossible to miss and offer strangely tempting bonuses. But are these CD Easter eggs really necessary? 
How important is it to have the demo version of The Beatles' "Penny Lane"? Or the original bootleg recordings that lead to the Velvet Underground's "Heroin"?

It's great fun to have some insight on the music process. Or to see what songs didn't make the cut on your favorite albums. But the new tracks only clog up otherwise great albums and taint your view of great artists.
I'll admit, I was the first in line to buy Beatles Anthology 1 (and 2, and 3), and I own a bunch of Elvis Costello's re-mastered early albums. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
 
Getting the chance to get something extra with these albums seemed like a win-win situation.

But it's not.

Whether these re-releases are supervised by the original artists or not is irrelevant. Once the novelty wears off, the extra tracks are just that: extra, and extraneous. I'm sure some will argue that the best songs on the newly re-mastered Velvet Underground and Nico are the outtakes. But the fact is, if these songs were so great, why weren't they put on the album when they came out? It's easy to explain why they're being released now.
 
Adding and re-working albums muddies the artist's original intent. Albums aren't meant to show a process, but a moment and message of the artist's choosing. Adding, rearranging and mucking with a piece of music is akin to touching up a painting or sculpture years later to make a few bucks. 

Do yourself a favor. Buy the original albums, on CD if you can, or ignore the extra window dressing. It makes for a clearer, better listening experience.

Headline: Great performance accounts for "Zora"'s triumphant run
Author: Marlynne Boyer
&nbsp;
By charming her audience with storytelling and sassy struts, Carey Hart gives a spirited performance as the late African-American female writer Zora Neale Hurston in the play "Zora" at the Mary Ann Wolfe Theater.

"Zora," written by Laurence Holder and directed by Jerry Maple, Jr. from the M Ensemble Company, attempts to project the image of a proud, independent, animated Zora. With vivid imagery and personality, Hart involves the audience in hearing about Hurston's life – including her experience in the "Big-Time" Jazz Age, her relationships and racism.

The play is a two-hour soliloquy that opens up with Zora taking authority by hushing barking dogs in Scene I. As the barking dies down, the ragtime melody "Sentimental Journey" is played. It is morning in Eatonville and the birds are chirping. Zora hums softly to herself as she washes her clothes in a tin bucket. With her hair wrapped in a brown-sequined scarf and wearing a long ruffled skirt with her shirt sleeves pulled up, she tells the audience about how she got to the "big time." She reminisces about her Harlem Renaissance days as an aspiring writer in New York City.

With gleaming eyes she looks at her audience and talks to them. She talks about her journey of success with the Gilbert & Sullivan Dramatic Troupe and her years at Howard University in Washington. The audience becomes comfortable with the position as "Zora's friend" and continues to listen to her. She lifts her skirt up slightly above her ankles and struts across the stage. The "strut" is a classy dance that African-Americans did at parties in the 1920s. When she talks to her audience about her love life, the audience laughs and smiles coyly. 

But when the subject of racism is brought up, the audience is silent and serious. Suddenly, the whole theater forgets about their moment of laughter because Zora's stories of racial discrimination in the Roaring '20s is no laughing matter. And so, the audience listens again as Zora says, "Mama always told me to grab the broom of anger and drive away the beast of fear."

Zora displays all sorts of emotions. At times she is nonchalant and relaxed. 

But there are moments when the memories of her past appear to bother her and cause her to be angry, like when she "sells-out" to the white man just so that her works can get published, or when her first love, Herbert, leaves for medical school. When Zora "sells-out" to white publishers, she begins to have belly-aches. These belly-aches are symbolic and intentional.

They are symbolic in that when Zora denies her African pride to conform to what is accepted by the publishers, her spirit aches. They are also intentional because Hurston had health problems and Hart wanted to give Hurston's character more depth. There are also moments when Zora tells her audience about how her works were even criticized by African-Americans, especially by Richard Wright. These sentimental moments are all a part of Zora's huge sentimental journey, and the audience can only sigh as they reflect upon these moments with her. "The real problem is that I was a single woman at heart," says Zora, as she reflects upon a failed marriage and a disheartened love life. 

The lighting concept of the play reflects upon Zora's passionate moments with her lovers and upon the moments that she embraces her African heritage. The lights upon the dimmed stage turn red as she discusses African roots with the audience, and Zora becomes proud and her vivacity intensifies. When the discussion is about her lovers, the lights turn red again to symbolize love and adoration for her past male companions. 

Overall, the life of Zora Neale Hurston was more than just a brief overview of her successes. Holder's play allows people to see the personal side of Zora – the side that people do not come in contact with through a two-page report. It allows a member of the audience to see Zora as a person; not only as a Black History heroine. The work is a worthy effort and very original.

Headline: "Monster's Ball" flirts with implausibility
Author: Danielle Biennenfeld
&nbsp;
When you find yourself wondering what's happenning within 15 minutes of a movie's beginning, you know something is off beat. Interestingly enough, three days later, I am still thinking about the film's weirdness but I cannot put my finger on exactly what was so bizarre. In "Monster's Ball," we are presented with several different captivating stories that revolved around "Monster's Ball," an old English idiom for a convicted man's last living day. After we are presented with each story, we finally begin to understand how the stories intertwine. However, how each thread links to the next seems slightly implausible.

Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) is a Georgia corrections officer who lives with his father, Buck (Peter Boyle), and his son under one roof. Buck is a bigoted, angry, bullying and sickly man who raises Hank to be a replica of himself. Neither of them is too pleasant to hang around. Hank is a terrible father, who shows his son no love or support. Unexpectedly,  the kid shoots himself. 

Then there is Leticia (Halle Berry), an alcoholic who, like Hank, is not big in the "parenting skills" department. Struggling to support herself and her son, Tyrell, she works as a waitress at a local diner.  Her ex-husband, Lawrence, is on death row, awaiting his final moment in the same corrections facility where Hank works. Hank and Leticia officially meet when a car hits Tyrell. He coincidentally drives by and hears Leticia screaming for help. Hank stops (even though he is a bit of a racist) to take them to the hospital. Tyrell doesn't make it alive. Did I mention that this movie is a not exactly uplifting? 

The main section of "Monster's Ball" begins from this point on, with the relationship between Hank and Leticia taking center stage. It's a relationship born out of serendipity and despair. When Hank takes Leticia home from the hospital, they have wild sex. Apparently, there's nothing like losing a son to kick-start the old libido. Sure, they are both in desperate need of security and love, but the sex scenes are so fiercely raw and highly explicit that they seem simply out of place.

This isn't a movie about a couple's mating activities, though; it's a serious movie about some of life's toughest tests. The next thing we learn is that Hank is no longer a spitting image of his father. In fact, he becomes a wonderful man and feels no hostility towards anyone with a darker skin color than his own. His character completely and unexpectedly alters. This would seem more understandable if they had shared some enlightening experiences together over a lengthy period of time, but he sleeps with her and miraculously his racist days are over. Hank also quits his job as a corrections officer, buys a local gas station that he names "Leticia," gives her a Jeep and then non-verbally suggests that Leticia live with him when a police officer posts a second eviction notice on her door and forces her to leave. This is all rather, shall we say, abrupt?

Indisputably, one good thing about this movie is that it teaches valuable life lessons. Racism slaps you in the face. The power of love, hatred and tragedy are highly explicit. Although the integration of the stories seems a little strained, the lessons that this film teaches are all significant parts of everyday life. At times, you can't help but to feel sorry for some of the characters, despite any confusion about the movie itself. The separate stories that eventually come together all surround "Monster's Ball" and each also adds to the anticipation of the film. We never find out what Lawrence does to deserve execution, but the reasons are not significant to the movie. His character and execution are strictly vehicles to bring the story lines together. Suspense begins to build because those reasons are never disclosed. With the progression of the movie, while each story becomes increasingly abrupt, the curiosity intensifies. 

In this way, the movie definitely kept my interest. Although I wasn't so certain as to where the movie was headed at times, the ambiguity definitely saved me from falling asleep. This was certainly the case for the last scene of the movie, of which I am still asking: "What?" I never thought something with abrupt changes could work dramatically, but "Monster's Ball" has proven me wrong, for its very abruptness is the element that saves it from utter boredom. Still perplexed, all I can say is that "Monster's Ball" is an appealing idea, that it teaches valuable life-lessons, but that's all a bit improbable.

Headline: Women's basketball moves on to SBC semifinals
Subheadline: FIU defeats New Mexico State 88-57
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Mandy Shafer hit a jumper. Deniz Boz found Cheryl Moody for a jumper. Cormisha Cotton scored of a Gergana Slavtcheva pass.

As quick as the FIU women's basketball team hit those three shots in the first seconds of Saturday afternoon's Sun Belt Tournament quarterfinal, the Golden Panthers were able to put away New Mexico State (13-16, 7-10 Sun Belt), 88-57.

Led by Moody's 19 points and Slavtcheva's 16 points and 12 rebounds, the Golden Panthers advanced to Monday's semifinals.

FIU (24-5, 14-1 Sun Belt) will now play the winner of Sunday's game between Denver (15-12) and Middle Tennessee (16-12).
 
"I think mentally we're where we want to be," FIU head coach Cindy Russo said. "When you go out and play a tough schedule as we have this year, it either helps you or slaps you. Fortunately it helped us. We're prepared."
 
The Aggies were held to two points in the first eight minutes of the game. A late first half run, led by Leah Welch and Sinnamonn Garrett, put New Mexico State within 15 at halftime, but FIU, led by its versatile, team-oriented game, dominated the remainder of the contest. 

FIU led 56-31 at the half, two points short of the SBC tournament high for points in a half.
 
"We needed to play near-perfect basketball," Nikita Lowry, the Aggies' head coach, said. "They have an inside threat. They have an outside threat. They have all the necessary tools to be a championship team."
 
FIU, whose confidence shows both on and off the court, is focused on one thing.
 
"I think we can improve. We can always get better. We have a long way to go," Slavtcheva, who had her seventh double-double of the season, said. "We're happy for the win, but we're not satisfied. We're here to win a championship."
 
Slavtcheva and Shafer combined to go 5 for 5 from behind the three-point arc in the first half, and the team shot 51 percent from the field in the game. The Aggies shot 39 percent. 

FIU out-rebounded New Mexico State by 15, making it difficult for the Aggies to get second chance opportunities.
 
Karen Roxborough was the surprise player of the game for the Golden Panthers. The senior, who saw just 37 minutes in the entire season due to not being completely rehabilitated from previous injuries and the flu, played 15 minutes and set a new career high with 13 points off the bench. 

Cotton and Shafer each added 11 points.
 
"I've had the opportunity of playing behind great players like Cheryl Moody, Gergana Slavtcheva and Cormisha Cotton," Roxborough said. "I'm glad I had the opportunity to play and play well and I hope this is how we're going to be for the next couple of games."
 
The Golden Panthers will play its semifinal game on Monday at 2pm. FIU defeated Denver 67-59 earlier this season, as well as sweeping Middle Tennessee. Denver knocked FIU out of last year's conference tournament, in the semifinals.

Headline: Men's basketball falls in first round
Subheadline: FIU exits SBC Tournament with 84-71 loss to North Texas
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Another airplane ride was something the men's basketball team wasn't looking forward to, especially after playing six of the last seven games on the road. But again, the Golden Panthers were dressed in their blue away jerseys in New Orleans, LA on Friday.
 
Again, the road hurt the Golden Panthers. But this time, it hurt a lot more.
 
FIU (10-20) ended its 2002 season with an 84-71 loss to North Texas (15-13) in the first round of the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. North Texas moves on to play the East Division's No. 1 seed, Western Kentucky (25-3), on Saturday night.
 
Haven Jackson, the senior captain who had become a regular starter for the Golden Panthers, was in street clothes, riding a one-game suspension, due to what head coach Donnie Marsh described as conduct detrimental to the team.

The Golden Panthers were out-played by North Texas in every area of the game.

"[North Texas] did the better job all the way around. They deserved to move on," Marsh said. "Being on the road takes a lot out of you, but [the conference finals] was a new season that needed an additional amount of adrenaline today."
 
While it was a flurry of FIU three-pointers late in the game that secured the win for the Golden Panthers during a January regular season game at North Texas; it was a an eruption of three-pointers from North Texas' Chris Davis in the first half that allowed the Mean Green to walk away with the game.
 
It was Davis who missed a crucial, late free-throw that cost his team a win over the Golden Panthers earlier in the season.
 
"Yeah, there was a little bit of motivation," Davis said with a smile. "We wanted to come out and play well since [FIU] came down to North Texas and they beat us. We wanted to come out and establish that we came to play our game."
 
Marsh said FIU "had no answer for [Davis]. He is a terrific player."
 
North Texas jumped out to an early lead 23-17 lead, with 12 of those points belonging to Davis.

A come-from-behind run, characteristic of FIU, came midway through the half. FIU closed the lead to seven, but the Mean Green responded and once again pulled away.
 
"I think their aggressiveness this time was a greater deal. Chris Davis and everyone on that team shot the ball very well," Taurance Johnson said.
 
Rodrigo Viegas had nine points, becoming the 18th FIU player to score more than 400 points in a single season. 

Johnson finished the season with 55 blocks, three shy of the school record. He and Nick Novakovic each added 16 points.
  
The Golden Panthers shot 43 percent from the field, compared to the Mean Green's 54 percent. The shooting percentages, combined with North Texas' 50 percent shooting from behind the three-point arc, were too much for FIU to overcome.
 
North Texas head coach Johnny Jones had nothing but compliments for FIU.
 
"I am very proud of our guys, but I think we played a very good FIU team," Jones said. "It's been a tough year for them, they've been close in a few ones, [versus Western Kentucky] I think they were close," Jones said. "[But] I feel we've beaten a very good team [whose] record doesn't reflect that."
