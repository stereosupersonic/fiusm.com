Headline: Marsh fired after losing season
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Wrter
&nbsp;
After four straight losing seasons, Athletic Director Rick Mello dismissed head basketball coach Donnie Marsh on Thursday.

FIU just ended its worst season in 18 years with a miserable 5-22 record and failed to make the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. In Marsh's previous three seasons at FIU, his teams posted records of 8-21, 10-20 and 8-21.

Mello rated competitiveness as the final factor in the decision to relieve Marsh from coaching duties.

"Wisdom, effort, integrity and doing the right things, you can ask no more than that from Donnie, but the main reason we made a change is that we weren't getting the results we wanted to," said Mello.

"The university is very appreciative of coach Marsh for the manner in which he led our basketball program," added Mello. "Donnie has always given 100 percent with the highest degree of class and dignity one could ask. We just feel from a competitive standpoint, that it is time to seek a new direction."

It was a year of injuries and suspensions that hurt Marsh's team and caused the coach to play players that weren't ready to play the long minutes they were being asked to. 

"There's no question we would have been better. The lineup I envisioned at the start of the season consisted of Junior Matias, Carlos Morban, Taurence Johnson and Eulis Baez. Because of different situations, this did not happen and the Marcus Robinsons and Byron Burnetts had to play more minutes than we would have liked," said Marsh.

As a result, Marsh's team averaged just 56.1 points per game, ranking at the bottom of the conference.

It's a challenge in a difficult league, but we did a good job of competing by how well we defended. But it comes down to scoring points and we didn't do that," said Marsh.

Marsh still had 20 months left on his contract. Due to a clause on the contract, the university can assign him to another position within FIU. Marsh has not made a decision yet on accepting another position.

"I don't know. At this point we have yet to discuss anything," Marsh said. "They [FIU] have the right to reassign me in my contract. We will talk again after I clear my head sometime next week."

With a possible return of Matias next season and players such as Robinson and Raphael daSilva with a year's experience under their belt, Marsh would have liked to have another season to provide results.

"I would have liked to have another year and I am disappointed we didn't show more progress. 

This year again we got hit by injuries and other situations, but in this league with four straight 20-loss seasons, losing the job is a possibility and that's what happened," Marsh said. According to Mello, a search will begin to find a replacement, but his efforts will be kept private. There is no preference for an experienced coach or one with South Florida ties. Mello would also like to wait for postseason play to be over in order to find candidates there.

"There is no kind of profile. Miami is a unique place and I just want to get someone who can fit our profile and do a good job at FIU, but you always try to get someone with as much experience as possible," Mello said.

&nbsp;
South Alabama junior Genevieve Delk's three-pointer with 12 seconds remaining dropped the Golden Panthers, 59-58, on Monday night in Mobile, Ala. With the loss FIU drops to 11-14, 5-7 in Sun Belt Conference play. 

The win clinched a share of the Sun Belt Conference West Division title and was the 20th win of the season for the Lady Jags, an accomplishment unmatched since 1988.

The Golden Panthers seemed to have the game locked up after hitting three of four free throws to boost their advantage to 58-53 with less than a minute to play. 

Delk grabbed a rebound for USA (20-5, 9-4) on a missed FIU free throw, passed to senior Sara Carter who drove down the court and sunk a trey to close the Golden Panther lead to two. 

FIU missed the front end of a one-and-one situation with 29 seconds remaining, and broke down defensively once again, allowing Delk to get free and sink the clinching three-pointer for the Lady Jags with 12 seconds to play.

The loss dropped the Golden Panthers to 1-7 this season in games decided by five points or less. More importantly, FIU is now in danger of missing the conference tournament.

 Only the top eight teams qualify for the postseason, single elimination tournament which is slated to begin on March 4 in Bowling Green, Ky. Additionally, at 11-14, FIU is facing the possibility of posting its first losing record in 23 years.

Milena Tomova finished with a game-high 23 points and eight rebounds for the Golden Panthers. Ivelina Vrancheva added 13 points, three rebounds and three steals. 

Vrancheva also moved up to fourth on FIU's all-time lists for most three-pointers made in a season with 100 thus far in the season.

Jello Moore chipped in with six points and seven rebounds.

Four Lady Jags finished in double-figures, led by junior Donyel Wheeler's 14 points, four rebounds and three assists.

The Golden Panthers close out their regular season at home against Western Kentucky on Saturday, Feb. 28, at 7 p.m.

&nbsp;
After getting their first Sun Belt Conference win against New Orleans, the Golden Panthers couldn't make it two in a row as the South Alabama Jaguars defeated FIU 62-46 at the Golden Panther Arena on Feb. 23.

The Golden Panthers trailed from start to finish and the team never had the lead. 

The closest FIU got was within eight, with 13:57 to play in the first half. FIU struggled from the free throw line during the first half, shooting only 37.5 percent, and entered halftime trailing 25-14.

The second half wasn't any better for the Golden Panthers. 

With 9:33 to go, the Jaguars led by 23 points, 48-25. 

Chris Young and Michael Phillips each added 11 points to lead USA. Henry Williams led all Jaguar scorers with 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting.

Coming off a victory, head coach Donnie Marsh expected his players to come out with a lot more energy, which wasn't the case.

"Coming off Saturday's win, it would really energize the kids to get two in a row and finish off at home with a win," said Marsh. 

I'm really disappointed with the energy level that we brought to the table from the beginning. It certainly didn't feel like a team that was excited about having gotten its first Sun Belt Conference win and wanting to get another one," he added.

Raphael daSilva led all scorers with 17 points in 38 minutes of play. Marcus Robinson added 13 points on 3-of-5 shooting from beyond the arch. FIU struggled offensively as the rest of the team combined for only 16 points. 

FIU shot only 36 percent for the game and had a tough time defending in the paint as the Jaguars hit 20 of 31 shots.

Marsh realized that FIU had no answers for the inside game of USA.

"We just got overpowered inside. It really just became man-on-man and we just got overpowered inside, and that to me was a sign of not feeling a sense of urgency," said Marsh. 

"I was really disappointed in that and I said that to the kids and hopefully they got the message."

Before the game, both Belco Bamba and Slavcho Slavtchev were honored as the seniors played their final home game. 

Bamba finished the game with a block and four rebounds as Slavtchev played nine minutes and hit two three point baskets.

DASilva named SBC Player of the Week

Just this past week, daSilva was named the SBC Player of the Week. 

The native of Brazil has scored in double figures in five of the last seven games. 

He led FIU to its first Sun Belt Conference victory of the season Feb. 21 against New Orleans by scoring a career-high 21 points, and adding five rebounds in 39 minutes.. 

The 6'6", 196 pound freshman is averaging 8.5 points per game since joining the starting lineup. He is the first Golden Panther to earn the recognition since Carlos Arroyo back in 2000.

"He is very much deserving and I was really proud and happy for him. The point we made to our kids was to congratulate [Raphael], which we did in the locker room," Marsh said.

"I made him congratulate his teammates because you only get recognized like that when you win," Marsh added. 

"We are all real happy for him as a team and it's a nice individual honor."

Subheadline: Unseeded FIU powers its way to upset of No. 4 Miami
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU may have already ended its five-game losing streak against Florida A&M with three straight wins last weekend, but it would have meant nothing without getting No. 4. As in the No. 4 team in the nation, the Miami Hurricanes, who made a cross-town trip to the west side of Miami on Feb. 26.

And FIU extended its winning streak to four games with an 11-7 win in front of 1,622 fans at the FIU Baseball Stadium.

"I think we actually played as a team today. We played like we can," said DeCarlo.

FIU had not defeated UM since May 2, 2002, a span of four straight losses, but the Golden Panthers didn't seem the least bit intimidated, jumping out to an early 8-0 lead by the third inning.

"Everyday I go out there, I expect to win. Our team expects to win. Other people might not have the same expectations as us, but everyday we go out there and expect to win," said FIU centerfielder Dennis Diaz, who was 2-for-4 with two RBI and two stolen bases. "Whether it's the Hurricanes or FAMU, it doesn't matter. We feel like we can beat any team in the country."

Already leading 2-0 in the second, FIU tacked on runs on back-to-back homers by first baseman Mike Lopez and right fielder Yahmed Yema, increasing FIU's lead to 4-0.

"I was just looking for a fastball high in the zone and I got it," said Yema.

With the bases loaded with two outs in the third, shortstop Luis Rivera hit the ball to UM third baseman Gaby Sanchez, who muffed it, giving FIU two more runs. Hurricanes reliever Chris Perez then threw a wild pitch, which scored Yema and gave FIU an 8-0 advantage.

FIU junior Derek DeCarlo started the game and dominated the UM lineup. He allowed only seven hits, two runs and struck out eight batters in seven innings of work, while feeding off the large crowd. 

"I felt good out there tonight. We had a lot of fans here. I could actually hear it when I was out there pitching. I think it helped out a lot," DeCarlo said.

"We actually had the home field advantage because usually when they come here, they have just as many fans and it seemed like it was a little lopsided in our favor this year," he added.

DeCarlo (1-2) ran into trouble only once, allowing two runs in the fourth on a wild pitch and an infield single, cutting the FIU lead to 8-2.

But DeCarlo cruised throughout the rest of the game, keeping the UM offense off balance all night.

"I think DeCarlo giving us six innings, because our [starting] pitchers hadn't gone past the fourth inning in Hawaii, really helped us," said head coach Danny Price.

Junior Danny Hernandez relieved DeCarlo in the seventh and wasn't greeted pleasantly. 

After allowing two singles and a walk, Hernandez allowed a grand slam to Miami first baseman Jim Burt, who drilled the ball over the right field fence, making the score 9-6. 

But FIU responded in the bottom half of the inning, when senior third baseman P.J. Lehmann sent a Chiqui Chirino pitch over the right-centerfield fence, good for two more runs and an 11-6 FIU lead.

"When Burt hit the grand slam earlier in the inning, I knew we had to respond, so I was just looking to get a fast ball up and drive it up the gap and it went over [the fence]," said Lehmann.

Junior Leo Calderon came on in the ninth and sealed the win despite allowing four hits in the inning. 

Calderon loaded the bases, but got UM right fielder Richard Giannotti to line out to shortstop for the final out.

"I thought we swung the bat extremely well and played really good, solid defense," Price said.

FIU improved to 5-7 with the win while UM dropped to 4-3.

Mallo's letter unfounded, down-plays facts about Bush administration

To the Editor:


I must admit that when I open up The Beacon and find a letter from Drew Mallo, I get excited. 

I know I am within seconds of having a good laugh, and that's exactly what I got while reading Mallo's off the wall comments while relaxing in the library. Just to recall, he refers to Bush as a "largely successful president." 

Let's examine what Mr. Mallo believes to be "successful."

President Bush sent young Americans into a war in Iraq based on the "fact" that weapons of mass destruction were undoubtedly posing a direct threat to our country. 

Thanks to David Kay, we now know Bush lied. 

What makes this situation even more pathetic is the fact that Bush refuses to accept any part of the blame for his decision that has cost more than 500 Americans their lives. 

Even Democratic presidential nominee John Edwards has personally accepted blame for the war because he simply voted in favor of it in the Senate. 

However, being commander in chief, Bush still believes he bears no responsibility for his decisions.  It's funny to watch Bush stutter and stumble in his "Meet the Press" interview, where he was forced into backpeddling into saying the war in Iraq was justified because there was the potential for WMDs. Nice.

Mr. Mallo believes the economy is another Bush political strength.  Upon taking office, Bush inherited the largest budget surplus in American history, thanks to what Mallo refers to as the "Clinton-Gore recession." 

Either I'm terribly off in my understanding of the word "recession," or Mallo simply is in denial like most other Republicans.  

However, we are now saddled with the largest budget deficit in American history. 

According to American economists, Bush's new budget proposal will do nothing but increase the deficit to where our own grandchildren will be paying it off. 

State and local programs will be cut, 65 federal programs will be cut with 63 more taking slashes, but it's ok as long as Bush's tax cuts guarantee his wealthy friends, and corporations, keep raking in the cash (think Halliburton).

Finally, Mallo downplays the fact that Bush shirked his duties in the National Guard. 

Follow me here Drew, because it's apparent you're not in tune with politics. 

Democrats are not saying it is impossible for a president to be successful if he did not serve in the military. 

Bill Clinton proved that. What Democrats are proving is that Bush is completely unreliable as a person and as a president. His disaster in Iraq and the economy has proven that already. 

However, the blatant disregard to serve his country, even in the National Guard, just adds on to his problems. 

What makes it all even sadder is how Republicans dare to question John Kerry's patriotism. 

This is a man who bravely led troops into fire in Vietnam and rescued fellow soldiers out of murky waters while under attack.

It's clear that Republcans, much like Mr. Mallo, are clinging for any traction nowadays. 

Polls are showing both Kerry and Edwards beating Bush, and Republicans are desperate for a change in momentum. 

Unfortunately, they won't find it. The American people have been tortured these past three years and most have stood up and declared they will not be forced to four more years of disaster. 

Come November, what will soon be the Kerry-Edwards campaign will wipe the floor with Bush-Cheney. 

My message for President Bush: Don't let the door hit you on the way out!

Headline: Employers recruit at FIU
Author: Enma Leyva/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With more than 70 businesses on display, FIU's Career Services department recently held its Career and Internship Fair. The fair was held at Biscayne Bay Campus where hundreds of students had the opportunity to talk to employers and apply for jobs and internships. 

"This is a great opportunity to make contacts that can help you in the future," said Craig Cunningham, Assistant Director of Career Services at BBC. 

This is the second year Career Services has hosted a campus-wide fair featuring a variety of businesses for students in different fields. Despite the rainy day, students flocked to the fair in professional attire for the chance to talk to recruiters from companies such as Sun Sentinel, The FBI, Holy Cross Hospital and more. 

The day was bustling as recruiters walked around and handed out flyers for students or just stayed at their table and explained to those interested what their business was about. For journalism graduate student Giselle Sanabria, this was an interesting first time experience. "I'm looking for an internship with a newspaper or channel," Sanabria said as she gave Telemundo her resume. "It's a great opportunity for students to know all about the companies."

Cunningham said the event took about three months to organize. 

The college charges a registration fee for employers to come to the career fair. During the day, Career Services provided breakfast and lunch for the employers. 

From real estate, to law enforcement, the variety of businesses gave students the chance to explore the different fields and gather information about their specific market. 

"I'm looking for a full-time job in accounting," said graduate student Maggie Chen. 

Chen said that although she was able to get some information about the market, there were not that many employers in her field. 

Employers also had the chance to interview students and recruit them for their company. Although some internships pay students for their work, most offer college credit. 

Assistant for Invent-Tec's Human Resources, Rochelle Logan, said that she was looking to find interns for the company. 

For most students, gathering information was essential to seeing which company they would like to invest their time in before applying for a job. 

"We have FIU graduates and interns working for us and they've proved to be quite competent," Logan said. 

Chavanes Destinval, who is working toward his second bachelor's degree -this one in Civil Engineering- said he was simply exploring and picking up applications as he walked around. 

"I'm looking for a job as a special agent or in law enforcement," said Destinval who already has a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice. 

Employers also got to see the best of what prepared students had to offer. 

"I'm hoping to find good sales employees," said New Times sales director Anthony Gordon. 

Gordon said that some of the things he looks for in his employees are that they are self-directed, self-motivated and have previous sales experience.

Headline: Greeks rock for kidney foundation
Author: Indra Bosko/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Phi Sigma Sigma's 13th annual Roc-a-thon raised $4,000 for  the National Kidney Foundation Wednesday.

Members from Delta Phi Epsilon, Phi Mu, Sigma Alpha Mu, Pi Kappa Phi, Alpha Xi Delta , Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Gamma Delta joined in Phi Sigma Sigma's battle against kidney disease. 

The charity event was held at the Graham Center pit which took place from 10 a.m. - 10 p.m. The GC pit was decorated with butterflies, which are the National Kidney Foundation's official mascots, and blue and yellow baloons.

Each organization also had to bring and decorate their rocking chair. 

"One Phi Sigma Sigma sister had to go all the way down to the Keys to get the perfect chair," said member Laurie Crosby. 

There were eight rocking chairs with decorated themes. Pi Kappa Phi had a Mardi Gras theme. But instead of giving beads they gave their time. 

"It's better than sitting home and doing nothing," said member Jose Torres. 

"People with kidney problems can't move around a lot. Us sitting in the rocking chairs is a demonstration and symbolizes the event," said Breny Deparre, Phi Sigma Sigma vice president.  

Students can take turns sitting whenever someone gets tired or leaves so that the chair is occupied for the entire 12 hours.

Volunteers received free food and were encouraged to socialize with each other. 

Sitting in his chair for five hours, Alex Garcia of Pi Kappa Alpha said "I was able to play games like dominoes, UNO, and Clue with friends." 

The others either listened to music or played video games. 

The scene also attracted non-fraternity members and curious students. According to many of the participants, philanthropy is a two-way street. 

"It's important to go to everybody's fundraising event. We go to their events and they come to ours because they are all good causes and we are trying to get people to be leaders," said Phi Mu member Margarita Torres.

Last year, Phi Sigma Sigma surpassed its goal and raised more than $4,000.  

This year, raffle tickets were sold for a dollar each and each fraternity had their own collection bucket  for everyone to donate money. 

"That penny or quarter in the bucket is more money than the foundation had before," said Delta Phi Epsilon President Marcia Garcia. 

According to Deparre, because big companies already have their own philanthropy, local Miami businesses such as Einsteins Bagels; Marimila Interior Inc.; MIC Apparel; Myra & Co.; Safeguard Health Plans; Smoothie Lounge; and Two Chefs Cooks help sponsor the event. 

Greek Organizations and each of Phi Sigma Sigma's members also have to donate a minimum of $50. 

Prizes included a spa package donated by a local spa company. 

Awards will be given out by Phi Sigma Sigma to the most creative chair and whoever raises the most money. The money raised goes directly to the national Phi Sigma Sigma foundation located in Boca Raton, Fla. It is then distributed to the National Kidney Foundation as well as other educational funds and scholarships.

Phi Sigma Sigma's philanthropy chair, Nicole Gutierrez, said that 30 years ago, the National Kidney Foundation was the chosen philanthropy among Phi Sigma Sigma's chapter's around the nation because kidney disease was the number one killing disease in America. 

According to Deparre, today, seventeen people die per day from kidney-related diseases. 

Deparre and Gutierrez both grew up with kidney problems. Guttierez has had three different kidney related surgeries. Phi Sigma Sigma's chosen philanthropy is one of the reasons she joined the fraternity. 

"This means more to me than anything that I have ever done before," said Gutierrez. "I hope other people realize how lucky they are."

Headline: Murdock:Reparations a 'dumb, dangerous idea'
Subheadline: Conservative student union sponsors lecture on slavery reparations
Author: Brenda Adrianzen/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Speaking at a lecture Feb. 26, nationally syndicated columnist and political activist Deroy Murdock spoke out against financial reparations for slavery saying "neither slaves nor slave owners are alive today."

His lecture, titled "Reparations: A Dumb and Dangerous Idea" was sponsored by the American Conservative Student Union in conjunction with Young America's Foundation.

According to Murdock, reparations would be difficult to carry out because of the difficulty of deciding who should pay for the reparations.

It would be almost impossible to agree on who would receive the reparations, Murdock said.

Descendants of immigrants and descendants of Americans who opposed the war by fighting in the Civil War or by being active abolitionists would be expected to pay.  Great-great grandchildren of slave owners would owe payments.  

Murdock asked, "Is it the fault of any white American alive today that his ancestors owned slaves?"

He questioned whether successful black people should receive reparations and whether the descendants of islanders would be included.  

Using the 2000 census to make his point, Murdock stated that the American black middle class is growing and becoming more prosperous through diligence and hard work.  

"One of the worst things about reparations is that it undermines these accomplishments," Murdock said.

Addressing the dangers of reparations, Murdock said that if compensations are made, then white Americans will adopt a "paid-in-full mentality." 

 Several audience members disagreed with Murdock's position stating that reparations are necessary as a symbolic gesture and they help alleviate the repercussions of slavery still felt today.  

Murdock countered saying he believes most people are looking for monetary benefits, not apologies.  

He also stated that "if you are concerned about race relations, reparations will reinforce the idea of inferiority." 

Murdock also focused on the public education system and welfare.  

These are two programs he believes are vital in improving African-American society.  According to the 2000 census, 27 percent of the $434 billion welfare expenditure went to African-Americans.  

Former American Conservative Student Union president Saul Escobar said he hoped "people realize that there are different views on campus, especially when the liberal view is so prominent."  

He hoped Murdock showed African-American students that it is acceptable to be a conservative.  

The American Conservative Student Union's aim is to educate the campus about conservative principles.

"I came in just to see what he had to say," Greg Thek, who is an FIU student, said. "I agree with him."

Murdock's column, "This Opinion Just In..." is syndicated in several newspapers including the Washington Times and the New York Post. Murdock is also a contributor to several publications that focus on fiscal matters, political corruption, global economics and race relations.  

He served as an intern on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee under Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah from 1982-1985.  From 1987-1989, he served in the National Advisory Board on International Educational Programs.  

Murdock received an ABA in government from Georgetown University and an MBA in marketing and international business from New York University in 1989.

Headline: Unicorns do exist; at least in Canada
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Who would've thought Canada could be producing such awesome music? No, I'm just kidding, I love Canada and it doesn't surprise me one bit that bands with such uniqueness come from a land that at least appears to be on the right track in many ways that the United States isn't.

 In retrospect, it hasn't been long since Montreal born indie-poppers, The Unicorns, have revealed themselves to the U.S. That in mind, the enormous buzz the trio carries with them is impressive or at least it makes us wonder why the hell these guys, often donning furry pink outfits in photos, are being talked about so much.

I had a chance to speak with the one of The Unicorns' founding members, Alden Ginger. Calling from Montreal, he gave me a few minutes  to discuss touring, music in general and other things that shall remain unpublished. Our conversation has, to say the least, got me very excited about meeting and seeing this band in action.

Q: How was California and the Noise Pop Festival?

A: It was great. They're really friendly over there, even their muggers. I was kind of walked over to this corner and kindly asked for my wallet and gave me back my ID, it was almost like a mutual relationship. I actually left the experience feeling a little closer to the [mugger]. I also met this really nice speed head.

I was beginning to wonder if this guy was serious.

Q: How did you decide to make your live performance so interesting and unique?

A:  It's hard when you play somewhere different each night not to have a formula. There is an element of spontaneity we want to keep though. Things just kind of end up how they do, we go into a show not really expecting anything. This one time the power went out and I got naked.

Before I had a chance to ask Ginger another question, he asked me if I had heard a noise? He told me it was a gunshot. He went on and told me he had been shot and was bleeding profusely. I decided I should probably end the conversation quickly so he could seek medical attention.

Q: What makes your band and everything you do worthwhile to you?

A: Chicks and drugs, those are always nice.

The Unicorns will be performing as part of the Winter Music Conference on March 4 at The Soho Lounge, 175 N.E. 36 St.

Headline: Ultra Music Fest joins WMC as event opener
Author: Joyce Fabregas/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
More than a million watts of sound, more than fifty thousand party people, more than 200 artists, DJs and producers, 14 hours nonstop, on 12 stages: This is the "ultra" experience. Thousands of people are expected to gather for one of dance music's most anticipated events of the year and the largest music festival of its kind in the United States: the sixth annual Ultra Music Festival this Saturday. It is an open air, 14-hour event held at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami that begins at 11 a.m. and ends at 1 a.m. Sunday. 

This year, the festival is said to be the most extravagant ever, including a lavish line-up and events such as an Armani fashion show and a live broadcast of BBC Radio One's "Essential Mix" show to millions of listeners in Europe: For the first time ever, the Winter Music Conference is teaming up with the Ultra Music Festival. 

For years, the two organizations have maintained separate identities as far as promoting their events was concerned, even though they were held in the same city and during the same week. This year, the Winter Music Conference has announced that the Ultra Music Festival as its official opening event. 

The Winter Music Conference, which is in it's 19th year, is regarded as the singular networking event in the industry. 

Every aspect of the industry is represented including the top technological innovators, artists, DJs, producers, radio and video programmers, retailers, distributors, audio manufacturers and many more from all over the world. 

Certain issues such as the music industry's current "metamorphosis" in the way people create, buy, sell and listen to music, are among the topics to be debated at this year's conference.  

The Winter Music Conference program will bring together professionals to present new ideas, discuss industry issues, and hold more than 30 important meetings and seminars that will focus on topics such as market strategies, artist development, copyrighting, publishing, and promotion. All in all, the music conference has a continuous mission to provide a decisive global platform for resolving the current challenges and stimulating new industry growth and revenue.

The Ultra Music Festival, founded in 1998 by partners Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes, has become America's premier and fastest-growing dance music event. 

The first two Ultras were held on the sands of the 21st street beach in Miami Beach. This year, Ultra will consist of 12 stages positioned along downtown Miami's 32-acre Bayfront Park with performances by dance music's biggest DJs and artists. 

An array of stages and tents will be divided by sub-genres such as the House tent, Progressive arena, Breakbeats pavilion, and the Drum and Bass arena, just to name a few

Local Miami DJs such as Edgar V., Cedric Gervais, and George Alvarado will be doing live sets along with other artists from around the world. 

Making their Ultra debut are artists such as '80s pop icon Boy George, and Tommy Lee, former drummer for the heavy metal band Mtley Cre, doing a live drum and DJ set. 

Other live acts many people are looking forward to are Rabbit In The Moon, Miss Kittin, Infusion, "rock" band The Rapture, and hundreds more. 

"I'm looking forward to this year's Ultra,. The line-up is amazing and the energy from the people there is great; it's not like a South Beach scene with stuck up, high maintenance people, the crowd is up beat but down to earth, it's always been a great experience," says Ramses Coro, an FIU accounting student.

I have been to Ultra myself and it is definitely something out of the ordinary. Fourteen hours may seem like a very long time but by the end of it, you leave wanting more. If you go to Ultra you will definitely have a memorable experience.

Headline: Club Dread: Comedic slash flick lacking humor, substance
Author: Chris Hewitt/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
What's worse than a bad joke? A prolonged bad joke, like "Club Dread." 

The movie comes from the comedy troupe, Broken Lizard, which also made the sporadically funny "Super Troopers." Given the history of Broken Lizard, you'd expect this movie about a serial killer on the loose at an island resort to be an "Airplane"-like spoof of splatter movies. It's not, and I'd give the Lizards credit for trying to do something different if I knew what they were trying to do, because the peculiar "Club Dread" isn't scary or funny. I chuckled at exactly one thing in "Club Dread," a parody of a Jimmy Buffett song title: "I'd Tell Ya But Then I'd Have Tequila." 

Otherwise, this is both a sloppy mystery, with meaningless clues everywhere, and a tedious comedy, with jokes that seem to date from before "Scream" turned satirizing horror movies into a cottage industry.  As in every movie of this sort, "Club Dread" boasts a scantily clad beauty who screams, "We're all gonna die!" And I found myself thinking: "Fine. But could you hurry it up, please?"

Headline: Kevin Smith shares thoughts on Passion
Author: Jorge Montes/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On Feb. 25, Mel Gibson released his third directorial film, the "The Passion of the Christ," amidst a fervor of controversy and media hype.

Gibson is not the first director to release a controversial film focusing on the Bible. In 1999, writer/director Kevin Smith released "Dogma," a comedy he describes as being about "fallen angels and other contemporaries of 'The Christ' (as we've come to know Him, courtesy of Mad Max Riggs)."  The film was condemned by the Catholic League and other groups, despite the fact that Smith himself is an active Catholic. 

On Feb. 26, Smith was in Miami to promote his upcoming film "Jersey Girl." While here, he talked about Gibson's film.

"I can't compare it [to 'Dogma',] says Smith. "It looks like Mel Gibson's movie is going to be successful. He has the support of all the people who hated 'Dogma.' Bill Donahue of the Catholic League was so soundly adverse to our picture, whereas he's backing Mel on this one, going 'every good Catholic should see this film.'"

Smith emphasized during the interview that he's not seen the film yet, but was basing his opinions on where all the media's attention seemed to be focusing. "[Gibson's] way into fetishizing the death of Christ," says Smith. "I know it's important. It ain't Jesus unless he dies and comes back three days later. But I like my Jesus as the guy who says nice things and parted very simple platitudes to save the day."

Smith also touched on the excessive violence of the film. "I'm not into the whole kind of like 'He died on the cross and he was butchered by the f***ing Romans and the Jews.' I don't know. That's kind of porn, isn't it? Porn for the religious right?"

Another aspect of "The Passion of the Christ" that Smith addresses is the way the film has been marketed as being "the truth about 'The Truth.' I thought they had scientifically proven they crucified Jesus through the wrist. If you crucify someone in the palm, they just fall off the cross. But in the movie it's in the hands. The Truth's obviously not being truthful."

As for the Anti-Semitic nature of the film, Smith added, "If this movie is anti-Semitic, then the Bible is anti-Semitic because the Bible is the one that throws around 'The Jews this. The Jews that.' It's all right there. And Jesus was a Jew. They conveniently forget that."

"I'm a half-full kind of guy," Smith grins. "Yeah, 'the Jews' killed Jesus, but they were supposed to. Otherwise, he's not Jesus, right? I mean, think about it. Without the Jews, we got nothing to wear around our necks."

Smith says, "It's easy to keep people around when Jesus is sounding like Gandhi or Martin Luther King because people can identify with that. But when you're like 'and then he died and rose from the dead three days later,' they're like 'get the fuck out of here. What else did he do? What did him [sic] and Santa and the Easter Bunny do at that point?'"

In the end, Smith feels this is the film's time and place. "For so long, the very conservative people of this country haven't had any movies to go to. I mean, we've had a nice long run of filth and s**t that they can't go to. So you got to give them their Christ picture once in a while."

"The Passion of the Christ" is currently in theaters. "Dogma" is currently available on video and DVD. "Jersey Girl" opens nationwide on March 26.

Headline: Gibson's movie stirs emotions, controversy
Author: C. Joel Marino/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Some leave the theatre crying; others remain in their seats, staring at the large screen, unable to say a word. They cannot move (some say they choose not to move) despite the fact that there is already a vast line of eager faces waiting outside the theatre, waiting to see if they too will leave the place awe-struck.

Though many movies have garnered large followings on their opening day, none have provoked such massive reactions (along with controversy and debate) as this one. Mel Gibson's brutal foreign-language epic "The Passion of the Christ" opened to full houses across the country on Feb. 25, Ash Wednesday.

Gibson, an Oscar-winning director and A-list actor, had shocked many in the film industry upon announcing a year ago his intentions of shooting a movie revolving around the last 12 hours of Christ's life.

Since then, what's been described as "Gibson's passion and folly" has been plagued by mishaps and disputes: the occurrence of James Caviezel, the American actor playing Jesus, being struck by lightning while filming in Italy; the fact that many production companies would not sponsor a movie boasting no great star-power and filmed entirely in Aramaic and Latin, and the charges brought against Gibson by Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League and several members of the Catholic clergy that the movie's portrayal of Jews as mad rabble-rousers could lead to large outbreaks of anti-Semitism.

These facts, however, did not stop both believers and the curious from thronging to movie houses across the country, especially here at FIU, where both the controversy and the backing of on-campus religious groups have helped fuel an unprecedented interest in both the movie and its contents.

On March 5, the newly established Eastern Orthodox Christians of FIU will be holding an open-forum discussion in the University Park Graham Center on themes related to the movie. In attendance will be the major Orthodox clergy of Miami, who will be giving their points of view on the movie. 

Other faith groups have decided that watching the movie itself would be a thought provoking experience. The Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, under the leadership of campus minister Vadim Hunte, attended a screening as a group, sharing their opinions and reactions within the theatre itself.

"I came and invited people to come because I knew the movie would raise questions, things I have thought about and believe in," says Hunte.

Though praising it for its artistic quality and historical accuracy, the campus minister also admits that the film proved to be rather bloody (Time magazine has called it "The goriest story ever told") due to the graphic detail of Jesus' torture and execution, though he also states this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

"Yes, I expected it to be hard to watch - but that is the core of our message, to ask 'Who was this man?' and see him giving his blood for the people. He had a passion, and it was for the world."

Senior Adam Albert and Freshman Jonathan Cameron, leaders of weekly campus Bible studies, would also agree, justifying the blood as being part of the message. Albert, who proudly admits having seen the movie twice, says he hopes the movie will give non-Christians a chance to see "... why Jesus was so important for our history," while Cameron sees the movie experience at a more personal level, assuring it has "accentuated a belief [he] grew up with and loved all [his] life."

"The Passion of the Christ" is currently playing in 3,000 theatres across the United States. Whether the movie is loved or reviled, it is assured that somewhere, in some theatre, someone will choose to remain seated after the screen has gone blank, unable to say a word.

Headline: Muslim Passion for Christ
Subheadline:  
Author: os21@aol.com
&nbsp;
The Beacon staff has been very kind in publishing many of my articles the past two years. These articles I have submitted are not limited to my viewpoint, but they are for the most part the views of the Muslim community in the United States. 

In regards to the release of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ I feel it is essential that the Muslim-American voice on the film not be diregarded and hence why I am forwarding this excellent article to you. I hope it is taken into consideration for publishing.

Thank you.

Muslim Passion for Christ

By Ibrahim N. Abusharif (contact info below)

Like everyone else, I was warned about the blood and violence, and braced
for it. But the bit about the English subscripts must have slipped my mind.
One unexpected thing I got out of watching "The Passion of the Christ" is
its affirmation that Jesus never uttered the word "God." Instead, he called
upon the Creator using a name that is very close to what I and other Muslims
often evoke, namely, the word "Allah." (The Aramaic word for God is
transliterated as "alaha.")

In a broad sense, "The Passion," as well as the controversy that stalks it,
is an extension of the very long struggle for narrative control over the
life and mission of Jesus. We, the American public, are given the impression
that the discussion about the movie and its main character is a discourse
between folks on both sides of a curious hyphen in the Judeo-Christian
ambit, with Rabbis and Jewish intelligentsia expressing their fears that the
movie will inspire anti-Semitism and with Christians denying that.

The irony here is that Muslims are perfectly poised to offer a view that no
one seems to be talking about. What "The Passion" depicted in chilling
imagery is but one narrative among several about Christ. In fact, Gibson
portrayed one "canonized" narrative of Christ (only 12 hours of it) that
received approval some centuries after the Messiah had lived and one that
does not enjoy consensus even in Christian quarters and scholarship.

When asked, a Muslim will tell you that Christ was not sent to die, but,
like the prophets before him and Prophet Muhammad after him, he was sent to
live and teach. In short, a Muslim would say there is no Christ killer and,
therefore, no need to associate anyone with that indictment and no need to
cause anyone to fear it. What happened to Jesus at the end of his life was
not about violence, but about honor in the face of vehement rejection. God
raised His prophet to Himself, thus sparing Jesus of the execution Gibson so
graphically detailed and imprinted in the public mind through the very
powerful medium of art and culture. This is a view that was also shared
among some early Christian sects, like the Basilideans, who believed that
Christ himself was never crucified.

To vilify Jesus and deny that he is one of God's prophets and messengers is
a cardinal sin in Islam, enough to disqualify one from the faith. To deify
Jesus, however,  is considered an affront to the primordial foundation of
the religion project: the oneness of God and His sole divinity. The Muslim
"middle" view here is not a self-conscious act of officiating a religious
debate between Jews and Christians. Our understanding and beliefs regarding
Christ are essentially identical to the beliefs we have about Noah, Abraham,
Moses, and Muhammad: all prophets, all humans, sent by God to teach humanity
certain things that should keep us guided and clear in our very brief lives.
If we are ever to be confused about something, let it not be about God and
His divinity, and humankind and our humanity, especially as it pertains to
our salvation quest. In Islamic theology, the human being is born pure,
brought into this world in a state of grace. The concept of Original Sin is
essentially homeless in our tradition. We inherit eye color and receding
hairlines from our parents, not their wrongdoing. Forgiveness, pardoning,
and mercy are of God's essence, and He generously bestows them for the cool
price of belief and sincerity.

In an important way, "The Passion" is an accidental expose about the
religious sensitivities of our times, about a wounded spirituality that
seems to require sensationalism to keep the faithful going. This is a point
that men and women of religion may all agree upon and observe in their
respective flocks. Mel Gibson unwittingly may have done a service in raising
issues indigenous to the human spirit that the postmodern world seems to
shun, issues about God, prophets, salvation, mercy, and hope. It's a vital
conversation with divides and alliances, passions and perils, but a
conversation that nonetheless can stand to hear the "middle" view that Islam
naturally offers. Something of this view, in unavoidably brief fashion, now
follows:


Muslims love and revere Jesus, and believe in him as a Prophet and Messenger
of God, a great teacher and guide for people. But Muslims do not believe
that Jesus was God or the Son of God. Nor do Muslims believe that he was
slain on the cross, as some early sects of Christians had once believed.
Jesus was sent to the Children of Israel to revive faith and a spiritual
connection with God. All the miracles that Jesus performed were indeed true:
raising the dead, healing the blind and the leper, and more. These miracles,
however, occurred through the auspices of God's power and will, as it was
with the splitting of the sea for Moses, Solomon understanding the
utterances of animals, and many other suspensions of the natural order. God
is the Creator, and when He determines something, He but says to it "Be" and
it is! (as the Quran states). Muslims venerate Mary, the mother of Jesus.
She indeed gave birth to Jesus though she was a virgin. She was a spiritual
woman who was chosen among her people to the office of special contemplation
and prayer. But Muslims do not hold her to be the "mother of God" and
similar attributes. She too was fully human and was a beloved and important
person in a remarkable series of miracles in a special time in human
history. Every biology and miracle, the explainable and the inexplicable,
whether it is the creation of Adam from clay or the conception of any given
child of two parents, goes back to God. It is all the same to Him. All of it
easy. All of it His.

In Islamic parlance, Jesus (peace be upon him) is known by the venerable
titles of "Word" and "Spirit," since the Quran tells us that God cast the
"word" or "spirit" upon Mary, the Mother of Jesus. "Indeed, the angels said:
'O Mary! God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name is the
Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in this world and the Hereafter,
and he shall be among those brought near [to God]. He will speak to
humankind in the cradle and in manhood, and he is of the righteous" (Quran,
3:45).

Also, the Quran states: "The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was but a Messenger
of God, and His word which He conveyed to Mary, and a spirit proceeding from
Him" (Quran, 4:171). "And indeed God gave Moses the Book [Torah], and after
him We sent Messengers in succession. We gave Jesus son of Mary clear proofs
and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit [Angel Gabriel]" (Quran, 2:87).

The thought life of a Muslim with regard to all the prophets is best summed
by the following verse of the Quran "Say [O believers]: "We believe in God
and [the Book] sent down to us, and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael,
Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes; and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what
was given to [all] the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction
between any of them, and to Him do we surrender ourselves" (Quran 2:136).

Headline: Supreme Court case blurs separation of church and state
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In the recent Supreme Court ruling of Locke v. Davey, the court ruled that the state of Washington was not violating student Joshua Davey's First Amendment rights by denying him a federally funded Promise Scholarship because of his major in Pastoral Studies. The inconsistencies between rulings such as these and executive decisions such as the president's Faith Based Initiatives program, create a confusing and contradictory national stance on where the line should be drawn in the separation of church and state.

This ruling, which claims to be held in very "narrow" contexts, backed the state in choosing "not to fund a distinct category of instruction." 

Meaning, secularly taught theology through the scholarly point of view is funded, but "religious instruction - that is, instruction that inculcates a belief (or disbelief) in God..." is not. 

Whatever the technicalities, the ruling now allows states to deny scholarship funds to those currently pursuing degrees in devotional divinity studies. Some deeper implications of the ruling include the idea that voucher programs are pro-establishment with regard to taxpayer money being invested in "established" religion schools. School-choice cases in Florida and Colorado are both willing to go to the Supreme Court in response to Locke v. Davey, where programs were stunted by state courts not wanting to publicly fund religious institutions. 

If the president is going to push for Christian-belief based amendments like his proposed ban on gay marriages, then there's no reason why devotional studies and organizations should not be funded. Adversely, if federal funds are going to be denied to religious institutions like churches and to devotional theology degrees, then there must be a complete separation. However, approve one and deny the other and the decisions begin to seem arbitrary.

The free exercise clause in the first amendment stating, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" is apparently only adhered to when it is advantageous to government funding. When projects to create quality public schools, or government social services are too expensive, then federal funding is given for vouchers and religion-based public aid oranizations. But when a student who would otherwise qualify for an academic and need-based scholarship is denied it because of his chosen major, then the state cries for the separation of church and state. 

Obvious contradictions between different actions regarding religious are confusing. What we need is a strong, consistent stance.
