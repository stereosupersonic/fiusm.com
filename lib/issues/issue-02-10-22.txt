Headline: Health fee increase approved
Subheadline: Carter ready to appeal full increase
Author: Christina Kent/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a 6-2 vote Wednesday, the University Fee Committee approved a proposal which would increase the student health fee by $10.

The vote follows a series of question and answer forums regarding the planned increase, held at both campuses in the two weeks preceding the University Fee Committee's vote.

Under the proposal, the health fee would be raised to $54 in fall 2003 and construction for the proposed $3 million University Park expansion would be complete in late 2003 or early 2004, said  Chuck Tinder, associate vice president of Budget and Planning, who moderated both forum meetings.  

The proposed expansion will include an upgrade to exisiting facilities as well as the addition of a full-service pharmacy. In addition, a Women's Health Center will be added and existing services at both campuses will be expanded.

"We would expand our office hours to Saturday mornings, which would require additional support staff," Health and Wellness Center Director Robert Dollinger said. He added that as the number of students who use the health services increases, they may consider having hours extended to a few weekday evenings.

Students have expressed concern about the fee increase. 

Residence Hall Association President Craig Bond attended the forum. "I have mixed views about the whole thing. It's positive because it's going to help out more people and it's negative because it's more money out of our pockets."

Dollinger cites FIU's growth as need for the increase. "FIU is a rapidly changing, exciting, dynamic university. Both campuses together see about 27,000 students annually," he said. "In order for us to grow, we need to enhance some of our services in the health area. We include counseling, and yet we still have the second lowest health fee [of Florida's public universities]."

He also emphasized that the health departments are "self-supported, self-funded, and self-maintained." 

Cheryl Nowell, director of counseling and psychological services, spoke of staffing needs, the backlog of appointments and the increasing need to have a psychiatrist on campus more often.

Dollinger also noted that the Health Center is economical and convenient, especially for students who live on campus. 

"Our services] are a convenient, low-cost alternative for students whether they have insurance or not, and [the pharmacy] will especially benefit students in housing," he said.

John Bonnano, assistant vice president for Student Affairs assured students that the fee increase will not be recurring. "We take the health fee very seriously and don't plan to have an increase ever year," Bonnano said. "Our next increase wouldn't be for another three, maybe even four years." 

But the student leadership from Biscayne Bay campus is concerned about a lack of equal benefits at their campus. 

"The students from Biscayne Bay are not convinced that they will benefit from the increase as much as the students at University Park," Adrian Carter, BBC's Student Government Council president, said. "The students at Biscayne Bay see that the University Park campus gets a new building while we are stuck with two trailers."  

Carter and BBC Comptroller Nicaise Parillon casted the only two opposing votes via absentee ballot.  

Carter added that the SGC at BBC plans to lobby for a decrease of the proposed amount to the Board of Trustees Finance Committee this week.

"We try to look at the university as a whole entity and not separate the two campuses," Tinder said in response to the two opposing votes.

The proposal moves forward to University President Modesto Maidique, who will present it to the Board of Trustees for a final vote some time in November.

Headline: University celebrates breast cancer awareness month
Subheadline: Students can donate lids to cancer cause
Author: Asra Jawaid
&nbsp;
This month, FIU's Health and Wellness Center, Honors College and three of its sororities are all taking steps to mark the arrival of National Breast Cancer Awareness month on campus as they take strides to combat the disease. 

Every weekday this month, the Biscayne Bay Campus Health and Wellness Center is offering free breast screenings by appointment only. 

Last Thursday afternoon, the University Park campus Health and Wellness Center offered free breast screenings to the general public from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m., no appointment necessary. Wellness Center employees say approximately 70 to 100 women were tested throughout the day.  

"The staffing at the Biscayne Bay campus can handle the flow of people so the exam can be offered much more often there," explained Cristina Rodriguez-Pacheco, a senior health educator at the University Park Wellness Center.

In addition to free screenings, several campus groups participated in the American Cancer Society's annual "Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk" on Saturday, Oct. 12. 

Three FIU sororities – Sigma Sigma Sigma, Delta Phi Epsilon and Phi Mu – as well as members of Gamma Epsilon Phi, formerly known as the Honors College Society, took part in this event. 

Sigma Sigma Sigma President Lisa Mallard said close to 1,000 members of the South Florida community participated in this walk, which began and ended at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami.

"About 20 members of my sorority [Sigma Sigma Sigma] as well as Delta Phi Epsilon and Phi Mu walked with me," Mallard said.

Together, members of FIU's sororities raised a total of $600.  Gamma Epsilon Phi, the Honors College Society, raised an additional $600.

"This was a community event and FIU organizations were a small part of the overall attendance," said Stefan Jhagroo, a participant in the walk, junior at FIU, and president of Gamma Epsilon Phi. 

Among community participants were Miami Coral Park High School, corporations including law firms and church groups. 

The walk, intended to make money for breast cancer research, was planned months in advance. It is just one of a series of events the American Cancer Society is planning to raise awareness of the dangers involved when dealing with this disease.

In addition, Gamma Epsilon Phi particpated in the Susan G. Komen Foundation walk. 

According to American Cancer Society statistics, breast cancer will strike nearly 200,000 times this year alone and take more than 40,000 lives.

"It's something we should be concerned with all year round, not just in October," Rodriguez-Pacheco said.

Students who are interested in finding ways to get involved can participate in Yoplait's "Save Lids to Save Lives." For every pink Yoplait yogurt lid donated to a drop-off site before Dec. 1, the company will donate $.10 to the Susan G. KomenBreast Cancer Foundation. 

Students can drop lids off at any of 10 sites at UP: the bookstore, Campus Life (GC 340), the Student Fitness Center, the GC Information Desk, the Health Care and Wellness Center, the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs (GC 219), Undergraduate Advising (PC 249), the University Apartments (Bldg. A #110), the Victim Advocacy Center (GC 195A), and the Women's Center (GC 318).

Headline: Colleges blame states for huge tuition hikes
Author: Meg McSherry Breslin & Robert Becker / Knight Ridder 
&nbsp;
State budget cuts this year are prompting galloping tuition increases at many of the Midwest's biggest public universities, sharpening concerns over growing student debt and access to higher education for low- and middle-income students.

College leaders argue their tuition hikes result from an economic slowdown and cost increases beyond their control. But some policymakers say higher education has enjoyed several years of robust funding and it's now time to bring costs under control.

"Why is there no effective downward pressure on rapidly increasing college costs?" Keith Sanders, who is retiring as the president of the Illinois Board of Higher Education, asked a group of college educators meeting for a College Board hearing in Chicago this month. "We're avoiding the prime question _ why are college costs going up?"

Driven by deep state budget cuts and a need to stay competitive in research and faculty hires, many key state universities are proposing double-digit percentage increases in tuition for the next school year.

These proposals come on top of big tuition hikes passed last year for four-year public universities, averaging 7.7 percent nationwide and setting the average tuition and fees at $3,754 in 2001-02.

"It's the No. 1 concern in my life right now," said Cara Stepanczuk, a senior in Illinois who is considering both selective private schools and state colleges. Stepanczuk is at the top of her class, along with her twin sister, and she has a disabled brother requiring much of her family's resources. 

But she doubts that she will qualify for the financial aid she needs.

"I feel that all of my hard work may be for nothing, as my educational future will be dependent on my family's financial situation," she said in written testimony before the College Board.

Many students feel overburdened because tuition is pushing up debt. In the last eight years, the average debt among student borrowers has nearly doubled, to $16,928, according to a report released this month by the Higher Education Project of the State Public Interest Research Groups.

Students at the University of Illinois system may face a 10 percent tuition increase, based on a proposal trustees will consider in May. Ohio State approved an 18 percent increase for new students. Penn State is projecting a 10 to 13 percent tuition hike if the governor's budget cuts are approved.

The University of Minnesota is looking at a 13.5 percent increase. Michigan State is breaking its eight-year trend of keeping tuition increases below 3 percent, proposing an increase as high as 8.5 percent.

The University of Iowa already approved a 19 percent tuition increase for next year and still faces $38 million in cuts for this fiscal year alone.

Just last week, the University of Missouri system approved an 8 percent increase for its four universities, the highest percentage increase since the mid-1990s.

Facing the largest budget cuts in the system's history _ a potential for $108 million in cuts _ the University of Wisconsin system wanted a tuition increase of at least 9 percent, but the legislature has so far limited that to 8 percent.

The system's president, Katharine Lyall, said the university system no longer can keep tuition costs down and provide greater access to students for a high-quality education.



Access is Greater



"The actions taken so far suggest we're trying to have both moderate tuition hikes and high access _ at the same time that we're facing significant cuts in the state budget," Lyall said. "We either have to turn to tuition or downsize our enrollment. We're really at a fork in the road."

University leaders argue the tuition hikes are necessary to keep public education competitive.

"I do think in the next five years the best brains in higher education have to persuade the public that our expenses are real and can be understood," said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education and the former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. 

"The public has to recognize that there is a shift going on in public policy and that we're expecting the user to pay more of the freight."

Some student leaders agree that costs are getting out of hand.

"I'd like to see education remain affordable. When universities approve increases above the rate of inflation, I look at that as unaffordable," said John Thompson, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Springfield and the student representative on the Board of Higher Education.

Yet university leaders argue that the cost of a college education shouldn't be measured against the rate of inflation, and that many factors beyond their control are driving up tuition costs.

The University of Illinois system, for example, saw its insurance cost jump from $14 million last year to $23 million this year, partly to cover medical malpractice insurance for its doctors in the hospital system. Utility costs last year were also $7.5 million over budget.

"There's no provisions to pay for utility and Medicare increases and technological improvements that we've made," said Craig Bazzani, the system's vice president for administration. "In addition to the budget reductions, there's a whole bucketful of unavoidables we deal with."

Headline: Debates surround class size, funding
Subheadline: Amendments could affect universities
Author: Sara Henderson
&nbsp;
Two major pieces of legislation, Amendments 9 and 11, on the ballot for the Nov. 5 election could have adverse affects on funding in Florida's state university system. 

FIU hosted forums and panel discussions on both amendments last week.  

On Monday, state representatives Ralph Azra (R), District 102 and Annie Betancourt (D), District 116; Frank Cobo, Miami Dade School Board, District 7; FIU dean of College of Education Linda Blanton; and Rusell Chuderwicz, professor of economics and member of the Council of Economics Advisors to the Governor of Florida, participated in a panel discussion about Amendment 9.  Other panel members included Alvaro Coscuelleula of the Miami Benefit Club; Robert Hogner, professor of politics and ethics as well as at the Honors college; and Brian Peterson, who has been a professor of history at FIU for 30 years.  

Amendment 9, which sets state mandates for classroom size in K-12, could result in a cut in the amount of state funding to be allocated for Florida's universities. The amendment limits the number of students per classroom to 18 in Pre-K to third grade, 22 in grades four through eight and 25 in grades nine through 12. 

 "Florida ranks 44 in student to teacher ratios, 46 in SAT scores, 49 in high School graduation rates, and 50 in per capita spending," Chuderwicz said.  None of the panel members refuted these facts.  Many, however, argue that class size reduction is not a complete solution and that the Florida legislature cannot fund the amendment if it is passed. 

"I support the pre-K amendment.  We can fund that in Tallahassee," Arza said. "[Amendment 9] will hurt our state's education budget. It will affect funding," he said. "I don't think we can afford to pay for this."

BBC Student Government Vice President Alexander Levy also expressed concerns about how this amendment would be funded.  "If this bill passes, what [the students] don't want to see happen is . . .the Bright Scholars Program affected." 

Chuderwicz agreed. "It's shocking that the voter in the state of Florida is considering this amendment without knowing how it's going to be paid for," he said.  "The cost is about $30 million a year." 

Chuderwicz cited three possible sources of funding for this amendment. "An increase in sales tax from 6 to 7% . . [and]a state income tax" are two he listed, "though [state income tax] is politically infeasible," he said.  "This means what?  Other programs are going to get hit.  Would funding to FIU affected by Amendment 9?  You bet," he said.  

Students agree.  "Do we really have the budget?" Ricky Rodriguez, senior, English, asked.  "We have to weigh the pros and cons," he said. 

"I want to know how they're going to do this and what's the cost," Sophia Sosa, graduate student in education leadership said.  "To reduce class size, you have to increase teachers.  To do that, you have to have money.  If anything, they'll take money away from universities and [universities will] up tuition," she said. 

Marlene Sonohano, graduate student in public administration agreed.  "They're going to pull university money." 

While the class size amendment affects the total amount of funding allotted to the university system, Amendment 11 could affect how much of that money each university will see.  On Thursday, the Faculty Senate hosted a debate about Amendment 11 between Robin Gibson, chair of the Board of Regents and counsel to Governor Graham, and Adolfo Henriques, treasurer of FIU's Board of Trustees and former member of the Board of Regents. Termed the Graham Amendment after its primary Senate supporter, Amendment 11 restructures the governance of the university system, adding a central Board of Governors over the existing Boards of Trustees at each university.

 "The legislature would be very limited in what they do," Gibson explained.  "All they would do is appropriate public funds which are the funds raised by taxation."

But it is how the method of appropriations, relative to how similar central governing bodies have dispursed funds, that is drawing concern. 

"The end result of the Florida Board of Regents is that FIU, since its inception, has been at the bottom end of the funding spectrum, and universities with the most powerful alumni receive the largest share of dollars appropriated by the state," Henriques said.  

"With 34,000 students, FIU has an operating budge to $433 million," he said,  "But the annual budget for the University of Florida, which has a 46,000 student population, has a $1.8 billion operating budget." 

Henriques and University President Modesto Maidique think that Amendment 11 would mean more money would be appropriated to older schools like the University of Florida and less money for newer, urban schools like FIU.

Guillermo Urbina, senior, finance, agreed.  "It sounds like they're concentrating power in one head.  [There will be] negative effects, for sure," he said.  "Students [at FIU] are not going to benefit.  They'll pay more attention to bigger schools, not smaller schools like FIU and community colleges," he said.

Headline: In Our View: Class size amendment threatens university funds
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The proposed class-size amendment would be a wrong turn on the road to better education in Florida. 

The amendment calls for a cap on class sizes in grades K-12.  If it's passed, the number of students per classroom will be limited to 18 in kindergarten through third grade, 22 in fourth through eighth grade and 25 in high school.  Like anything else, these changes would come at a cost.  

Many more schools would have to be built and more teachers hired to meet the requirements.  State economists have estimated that implementing all of the changes would cost between $20 and $28 billion over the next eight years.  That is nearly double the current budget for K-12 education. The annual cost would be about $2.5 million.

Supporters of the class-size amendment have yet to propose a source for these funds. Health care and additional taxes are possible sources of funding, but one of the areas that is most likely to suffer funding cuts, if the amendment is passed, is higher education.  

Funding from universities would be allocated to K-12 in order to implement the changes.  Universities have already been suffering decreases in funding due to the decline in the U.S. economy.  The shortage of funding is already such that professors have to pay for photocopies out of their own pockets.  Also, due to the shortage there is a lack of professors.  Consequently, there have already been significant increases in class size at the university level.  If the amendment is passed, the average class size in K-12 will decrease while the average at universities will continue to increase.

While class size plays a larger role in the learning process during the earlier grades, at the university level it is also important.  Students need individual feedback and attention from their instructors regardless of what grade they are in.

In addition, if the amendment is passed, the quality of K-12 teachers would decline because many under qualified teachers would be hired to meet the new demand.  Having an effective teacher is more important than having a small class size.

Although smaller classrooms foster learning by allowing teachers to give students more individualized attention, it is only part of the equation.  The overall quality of education in Florida needs to be improved, and it shouldn't be at the expense of higher education.

&nbsp;
o the editor:



I was recently on the FIU campus, having just been hired to teach in the education department, and was quite surprised to read Andy Diaz's article in The Beacon, "Israeli claim to land unfounded." To base his entire point on the basis of one individual is irresponsible and weak journalism.  For there are, in fact, over 200 major Christian organizations in the United States alone, that do support the Jew's biblical claim to this small piece of real estate known as Israel.

Whether one believes the Bible or not, most historians do acknowledge that there has been a Jewish presence in that area since the times of Abraham. This has been documented in a variety of historical findings and archeological evidence.  Thus, the Jews had made it their home nearly 2,000 years before Islam even appeared on the scene!

I too share Diaz's point of view that Jews and Arabs can live together in peace.  But unfortunately for now, the current Palestinian leadership has shown its true colors time and time again. They have squandered millions in outside support funds (including lots from Israel), not for domestic development but for sponsoring terrorism and violence.  While the Israeli government has outlawed anything anti-Arab, from political parties (such as Kach) to bumper stickers, the Palestinian side continues to preach hatred and racism.  Israel is not even on the maps in the Palestinian controlled school text books.

Last December, I visited Israel for about two weeks.  It was my first time there in 30 long years and I went with an open mind.  I visited some Arab cafes and was very upset to see pictures on the wall of some suicide bombers.  Imagine how we Americans would feel walking into businesses where they glorify the image of bin Laden.

Israel has offered its hand in peace.  Despite that the Israelis have won four major wars of self-defense since 1948, they've still given land, cities, money and even weapons to the Palestinians in the hope for peace.  

Remember soon after the Oslo signing, Arafat rejected Israel's offer of 95 percent of the land the Palestinian Authority wanted for statehood.  The peace process takes two to tango.  So far, I don't see the Arabs willing to dance to the same music.

To the editor:

The latest edition of The Beacon has turned out to be a venue for anti-Semitic rhetoric. This genre of journalism is the same that is practiced by such grocery store rags as The National Enquirer and The Star. Yellow journalism should not be what a college newspaper aspire to.
I am specifically referring to the article entitled "Israeli Claim to Land Unfounded" by Andy Diaz. Not only is this an attack on the state of Israel, but this is a direct attack on the premises of Judaism and Christianity, as well as of most Western religions. The following false assertions were made in this article: First, the claim that Jews were never in Egypt. Second, they never conquered the land of Israel. And third, they never passed it on to the 12 tribes.
Diaz's research is based solely on one article written in 1999 by one individual at Tel Aviv University. The Beacon should check its sources before it decides what it will put into print. This is what responsible journalists do as a matter of conscience. Instead, it chose to publish any anti-Semitic writing in order to enlarge its readership. As a responsible student, I find this despicable.
If Diaz did his research, he would have found out that there is archeological evidence that specifically confirms what is written in both testaments of the Bible. There are remnants of both the first and the second holy Jewish Temples, as well as ancient Hebrew and Aramaic writings on walls and ancient structures throughout the country. Then one can mention the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is one of the most amazing archeological discoveries of our time. You could dig nearly anywhere in Israel and find ancient Biblical evidence. I encourage Diaz to go to Israel and find this out for himself. If he can't, FIU offers an entire course on Biblical archeology in Israel. If he's so interested in the subject, he should take the course.
Diaz makes additional unfounded comments when he talks about Lord Alfred Balfour being an anti-Semite. Lord Balfour was not only an architect of the modern state of Israel, but also a visitor of Jerusalem in 1922, where he contributed to the opening of the world-renowned Hebrew University. He forgets to mention that Theodore Herzl was appalled by the Dreyfus Affair not because Jews couldn't live in harmony with the rest of the world, but because Jews were being innocently targeted as scapegoats in Eastern Europe during the deadly pogroms of his era, culminating in the Holocaust some 50 years later. Jews in other parts of the world, such as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Benjamin Disraeli and psychologist Sigmund Freud, were being elevated to high positions around the time of Theodore Herzl. These names demonstrate but a few of the hundreds of Jewish scholars and politicians of the time.
Diaz mentions the tiny sect of Orthodox Jews that object to Israel because their waiting for the Messiah. He had to go to great lengths to find the few Jews who disagree with state of Israel. In the democracy known as Israel, those people are entitled to their opinions, even though millions think that they are wrong.
Which brings me to my final point: the biased description of last week's Jerusalem Post lecture by Elli Wohlgelernter. Diaz slantingly picked the three people who sounded the most ridiculous out of the 38 mostly Jewish people in attendance. He failed to mention any of the educated, sympathetic views expressed throughout the two-hour period (including the recognition of innocent deaths on both sides and the need for peace for both Israelis and Palestinians). 
Upon seeing The Beacon's senior columnist Andy Diaz at the lecture, I knew that the truth was going to be distorted with anti-Semitic, anti-Biblical and anti-Israel sentiments being reported. I am a true advocate and believer in peace for Israelis and Palestinians. Your writing simply provokes hate amongst these two people, furthering the disastrous conflict.

Headline: International students shortchanged
Author: Angela Castillo
&nbsp;
About 3,000 students currently enrolled at FIU are international. Most of them, including myself, come from  countries such as Jamaica, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. Due to the political, social and economic problems in our countries, many of our upper or middle class families make a big effort to send us to study abroad. But, the comparatively expensive lifestyle in Miami is a shock to our parents' pockets.

State residents pay about $84 per credit while we (international students) pay about $400 per credit - almost five times more!  The annual estimate of costs including tuition and fees, medical insurance, maintenance, books and supplies for each one of us is $28,956. The numbers speak for themselves.  

For this reason, we feel the need to minimize our parents' expenses by seeking a job on campus. However, working at the cafeteria or bookstore pays only $5.25 per hour. And, students with an F-1 status are only allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours per week, which makes a total of $105 per week. 

Not all of us have the advantage of living on campus and being enrolled in the campus meal plan, so the weekly $105 is reduced by the snack we get at our lunch break, plus the amount you spend for fuel. Whatever is left over is in most cases not enough to afford our textbooks, car insurance or even pay a quarter of our rent. 

It is true that our main purpose for coming to America is to pursue a full course study or degree, but we are not rich kids. 

It is frustrating and scary to think that an economic crisis in our countries may, God forbid, quake our parents' stable economies because we are ineligible to apply for financial aid or any type of scholarship. And no one can guarantee our savings account will cover the rest of our four-year education. 

We are reluctant to engage in illegal employment because in the long run it may cause our deportation, but I know that many have already taken the risk. A lot of students have gotten desperate and used fake social security cards to get hired; many of them have also applied having no documents on hand but their school ID and driver's license. Consequently, their employers take advantage of the situation and make them work from dawn to midnight.  The irony is that international students have a legal status in the country and yet are treated in the worst manner, as if they were illegal immigrants. 

It is not as if international students do not want to become permanent residents, but the reality is that the chances of doing so are very slim, especially now, post-Sept. 11.   There are only three options available to those who wish to become residents. 

The first option is marrying a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident to obtain a green card. Unfortunately, the consequences of fraudulent marriages can be very painful.  The U.S. partner can be fined up to $250,000, and the foreign partner can be deported and banned from ever re-entering the United States. 

The second option is participation in the diversity visa program or "Visa Lottery," but this is only an option if the person is from an eligible country. Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico are among those that have not qualified for this year's diversity program.   

The third and last option is probably the one most international students will go for: finding a job in our career field and enrolling in an endless process called "labor certification" that states that the job is not being taken from a U.S citizen or a permanent resident. As international students, our intention is neither to steal jobs from U.S citizens or permanent residents nor to quit college and get a full time job.  

If becoming a permanent resident was a more feasible option, many of us would become residents, but in the meantime, all we are asking for is the opportunity to get a decent job with a decent salary on or off campus to help pay for the cost of attending college. If not, the astronomical tuition and the denial of work permits off campus will only make dropouts of some straight-A international students.

Headline: Multi-tasking on road distracts careless drivers
Author: Eric Peters

By Eric Peters	

Knight-Ridder Tribune



The more time Americans spend in their cars, the more they try to make better use of that time by using cell phones and laptop computers to link up with the office and conduct business. Others simply entertain themselves via expensive music systems and televisions.

Distracting pleasures and making business decisions can't be conducted safely in congested urban traffic. For your own sake and ours, keep your eyes on the road and your mind on the task at hand – driving.

Multi-tasking, to borrow a phrase from the federal bureaucracy, is never a good idea behind the wheel – yet motorists continually attempt it, often with disastrous results.

From yakking on a cell phone to fiddling with the onboard GPS navigation system, more and more drivers are trying, and failing, to keep one eye on the road and the other on something else. 

An Associated Press article recently noted that accidents and deaths caused by distracted driving are on the rise. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates 600 to 1,000 such needless tragedies occurred in 2001, and as many as 2,000 motorists could be killed annually by 2004 by distracted drivers.

Unfortunately, the problem is likely to get worse as new cars and trucks become even more loaded with the latest technological doodads, including Internet access and the ability to check e-mail, for instance – automotive conveniences that are just around the corner.

A popular "aftermarket" modification already causing problems is the installation of televisions in the driver's line-of-sight, which though technically illegal is nonetheless something well within the ability of many backyard tinkerers. Nor is it especially difficult to find a shop that will do the job, either.

"We're seeing a lot of requests for mobile video," Wireless World salesman Doug Kalpakoff told the AP. Meanwhile, automakers such as Infiniti and Mercedes-Benz have been adding such things as "intelligent" cruise control that uses radar to adjust following speed and other such feats of technology that tend to absolve the driver of responsibility for actually driving the car. 

BMW has an Active Gas Pedal system in the works that will actually exert pressure against the driver's foot if the computer thinks it's time to slow down. Soon, we'll all be able to just take a nap, or at least be tempted to.

Add to this tempting mix, new and extremely elaborate audio and navigation systems that demand rapt attention and it's no wonder that people find themselves piled into the car ahead before they even realize it's time to hit the brakes. 

Unfortunately, it may take regulatory intervention to deal with this burgeoning problem. Many states have taken steps, for example, to restrict or forbid the use of cell phones by the driver while the vehicle is in motion. 

Similar steps may be necessary when motorists are able to access the Internet from their vehicles, a development that probably is only months, rather than years, away.

Even the most devout libertarians will find themselves hard-pressed to argue that government doesn't have the right to prohibit TV-watching by drivers of moving vehicles. 

However, using common sense can go a long way in averting government intervention. "Multi-task" once you're at your desk, and not behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. Don't let your distraction become your – or someone else's – destruction.

Headline: No. 8 Maine stops FIU 33-7
Author: Dan Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Receiver Cory McKinney slammed his towel to the ground as a Mike Mellow field goal sailed through the uprights in the east end zone at Community Stadium on Saturday. 

The score following this kick was 33-0 in favor of the visiting Maine Black Bears.

With 1:40 left to play, the Golden Panthers provided their coaches and the 5,303 fans in attendance a ray of hope.

FIU would muster a first down after a short completion and a quarterback scramble to put them on their own 45-yard line. 

This is when backup quarterback David Tabor found McKinney, FIU's leading receiver who had five catches for 111 yards, breaking off his route and calling for the ball while he stepped up in the pocket avoiding pressure. "Seems to me like I always find a way to get open," McKinney said. "He always finds a way to get me the ball." The 54-yard pass play helped set up a Tori Robinson touchdown from one yard out to prevent 
the shutout.

"I told the guys in the huddle, 'We can do this,'" Tabor said, "'We can put one in the end zone.'"

McKinney stressed the importance of being able to not quit when you're getting it handed to you badly. "It's very important for the team to show the coaches that were giving them our all and playing hard for 60 minutes," he said. "At that point in the game, all we have to fight for is 
pride."

By this time the score was 33-7, and it would end that way, giving the Golden Panthers their second straight loss and fourth on the year dropping their record to 3-4. 

In FIU's three losses, they have looked overmatched. It is also evidence of how far they have to go, especially at the offensive line and quarterback positions. "When we play teams like this, I see things a lot faster," Burke, who was 9-18 for 106 yards with two interceptions, said. "The game speed has really picked up."

The offense was unable to get anything going for the majority of the game, as they allowed four sacks in the first the half, and eight in the game. In hopes of seeing some improvement up front,  head coach Don Strock and his staff benched center Carlos Ruiz and replaced him with right guard Victor Cernius. D.J. O'Neal started in place of the relocated Cernius and Tim Dierks got the starting nod at right tackle. It didn't appear to help much as the young line failed to provide Burke, who is still adjusting, time to throw.

"Don't know if the light bulb is on for some of them yet, it's a little bit too fast," Strock said. "It's like a lightning bolt that hits them, they have to know the difference between practice, with the scout team and game speed. I told the guys before the game that they were going to have the chance to make three or four plays and they were going to have to make all of them. We had the chance to make eight, we didn't make any," said Strock, who also noted that every time he saw a receiver open downfield, the quarterback would be on his back.	

In regard to giving up eight sacks for 64 yards, Strock cited the offensive line's play as being "soft" and not being able to step up to the table. Some members of FIU's line will have no problem attesting. "It was nothing we didn't prepare for, nothing we didn't go over," Cernius said. "We're young as a unit, we make mistakes and it just kills us."

Maine's "Black Hole" defense held the Golden Panthers in check while its offense and senior quarterback Jake Eaton went to work. Eaton, who was 23-12 as a starter coming in to Saturday, threw for 187 yards on 18-28 passing. He connected with Ryan Walker on two touchdowns, one of four yards and the other from nine. 

Eaton, who has now scored a touchdown, either running or passing, in 33 consecutive games for the Black Bears, also punched one into the end zone from the one yard line on a quarterback sneak. 

Tailback Marcus Williams, rushed for 156 yards on 22 carries and a touchdown. 

Robinson Shows Promise

Robinson, who had been sidelined since the end of the inaugural contest on Aug. 28 with an ankle injury, returned to action in the second half and finished the day with 54 yards on five carries and one touchdown.

Headline: Sun Belt adds Utah State to leagues, looks to add Idaho
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
NEW ORLEANS - The Sun Belt Conference has extended an invitation of full membership to Utah State University.

Administrators from Sun Belt member institutions met earlier this week and unanimously approved the addition.

Utah State president Dr. Kermit Hall formally accepted the invitation at a Friday morning press conference on the USU campus in Logan, Utah.
The Sun Belt Conference also is exploring the possibility of adding the University of Idaho, which is being encouraged to submit an application for full membership in the league.   Idaho has participated as a Sun Belt football-only member for the last two seasons.

An exact timetable has not been set on when Sun Belt membership takes effect for Utah State, but it is anticipated that any new institutions will compete fully in the league no later than the 2005-06 academic year.   

Utah State's football program will begin Sun Belt Conference play in 2003.

Utah State is a current member of the Big West Conference in most sports other than football. Since the Big West discontinued its sponsorship of football after the 2000 season, USU has competed as a Division I-A independent.

"The presidents and chancellors of the Sun Belt Conference are extremely pleased with the addition of Utah State University," said Dr. Norval Pohl, president of the University of North Texas and chair of the Sun Belt Conference executive committee. "We are quite familiar with the high quality of the academic programs at the institution, and we are eager to develop academic partnerships that complement our common interests in providing competitive opportunities for our student-athletes. 
The Sun Belt has hit a home run in attracting Utah State University. [USU] brings added prestige to the Sun Belt."

Utah State joins 13 other Sun Belt member institutions.

Headline: Midtown returns to rock roots
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
I can remember a small Fort Lauderdale show I attended a few years ago. The underground music scene was better back then and currently famous bands like Dashboard Confessional and A New Found Glory had yet to be raped by MTV. This particular show opened with a band that attracted very little fan presence: the New Jersey natives Midtown.  

There was something very peculiar about them and their sound that set them apart from the other bands that evening. They, simply put, rocked.  

These days, the underground rock scene has a surplus of trendy indie-pop-rock bands. It's hard to describe the music specifically or place it in a single, general genre. Every band has their own style and design with individual trademarks that play on the whole independent rock feel. What is independent rock, though? This fusion with so many other elements makes it difficult to classify it as good, old-fashioned rock and roll. This gradual stray isn't a bad thing; in fact it's good, however, it is nice to hear a band like Midtown who isn't afraid to step back towards rock roots. 

With their sophomore release, Living Well is the Best Revenge, Midtown proves their self-appointed genre label as a rock and roll band. Of course, it isn't pure rock and roll; Midtown throws their own alternative element into the mix. 		

Each song drives a steady tempo through with a snappy, quick and precise drum beat. Even the softer and slower ballad songs have a general driving rhythm to them.  

Additionally, powerful distortion chords, brought to you by dual guitars, are an ubiquitous force on this album. The guitars constantly compliment each other, harmonizing and dividing the melodies. This ingredient is key in distinguishing the album as a complex work of art. Listen to the way the guitars sing to each other on tracks like "Find Comfort in Yourself" and "Like a Movie," their pop-influenced song, to hear an example of this artistry.  

Another striking component in Living Well is the vocals.  Many indie-rock singers, like Chris Carrabba from Dashboard Confessional, have a tendency to whine excessively in their music.  

Midtown abstains from this tradition and although lead singer Gabe Saporta does give the band a very defining pop element, he does so with an edge. For instance, in the song "There's No Going Back," Saporta keeps the vocals bouncing with rock-pop while spitting energy and rough emotion. The end result accents the music well and is very effective in getting your head to bob.

The only major flaw with the new album is Midtown's lyrics. They struck me as repetitive. Sometimes it feels as though every song is about the same thing: the same woman who broke somebody's heart by cheating on them or leaving or something tragic like that. Even considering this small blemish, the songs still rock. They even throw in a couple of rebuttals with uplifting songs like "In the Songs," a track about friendships and how far the guys have come as a band. 

These strategically placed songs add much needed balance and save the Living Well is the Best Revenge experience from becoming Sap Fest-2002. Put away those tissues.

When all is said and done, Midtown's new release is really a superb album. 

It's perfect for background music in the car or at a party and is structured in such a way that it never gets annoying. 

Midtown has indeed come a long way since I first saw them in that small Ft. Lauderdale club. In contrast to their older sound, Living Well is the Best Revenge is a definite assurance of their improvement in talent and professional musicianship.  One thing is still for sure though, Midtown rules. Now go and make the metal sign with your hand and listen to this album.

Headline: "Hearts" combines Disney, Square characters
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
It was in the 10th grade when I discovered the "Final Fantasy" games. A bunch of my friends and I were playing roller hockey and discussing the merits of an online chat-based RPG called DragonRealms. While I enjoyed the game to a small extent, I emphasized how I preferred more direction in the story and I liked visuals, thus the Zelda-style adventure was more to my taste. "What about 'Final Fantasy'?" someone asked me.

A few hours later, I had a loaned copy of "Final Fantasy III" and was just overwhelmed by the game. I spent hours and hours on it and loved every moment. I even had midi files of the game's opera, with sing-along lyrics for a special karaoke program for my PC.

I have profound respect for Square Soft and their excellent games. In the little I've played of "FFVII," "FFVIII" and "FFX," I've grown an admiration for the level of detail and effort put into each game. 

The stories are always epic in nature and as emotional as you could get in any literary form, while the game play itself is always trying something new, as if the programmers have an unwritten code (if you'll excuse the pun) to always be bold and different.

So when I heard Square Soft was teaming up with Disney to create an RPG that mixed up both their properties I could barely wait.

"Kingdom Hearts" is the ultimate Disney animation fan's dream come-true. Rather than yet another boring scroller with either pixilated animation or mediocre polygon-rendered recreations of the characters that takes you through the story you already know, "Kingdom Hearts" weaves a complex RPG storyline equal to anything you'd find in a "Final Fantasy" game, but with classic Disney characters involved.

You play as Sora, a boy looking for his friends in a mystical land known as "the kingdom." You, of course, should know what kingdom I'm talking about by now: the Magic Kingdom, a land ruled by King Mickey under the assisted guidance of Sorceror Donald Duck and a knight named Goofy. But when creatures called the Heartless show up in the many different worlds of the kingdom (each based on a particular movie) and King Mickey disappears, it's up to Donald and Goofy to team up with Sora and figure out what's going on.

I don't need to get much more into the story than that. These games are epic in nature. "Kingdom Hearts" is definitely a picker-upper. Everything about it is visually and aurally on the nose. The 3D rendering is downright flawless, from the animation in Donald's waddle to the tree-house in Tarzan's world. Controlling Sora, you actually feel as if you've been placed smack dab in the middle of a real Disney cartoon.

Now, in what can only be described as a gut-wrenching pain, I have to be honest with you as a reviewer. The game has some flaws. Major flaws. And we're talking the two cardinal sins of modern-day video games: camera and gameplay.

In what can only be described as a daring move, "Kingdom Hearts" is in a fully-realized 3D world with unlimited control, rather than the previous "FF" games which normally utilized either pre-rendered images or polygon designed levels with intense camera angle restrictions (creating the illusion of depth in what's still equivalent to one locked background image). Because of this change, the game also strays from its RPG roots, teetering precariously into the "Zelda 64" slash-and-bash style gameplay.

So how is this a fault? First of all, the villains are shadow-creatures that move very quickly and often flatten up and zip right under you. 

When you have a very skittish camera system like the one "Kingdom Hearts" uses, whenever you lock-on to a baddie, you often wind up getting incredibly dizzy incredibly fast. It can get downright nauseating. I actually found myself avoiding locking on to baddies so I could better devote my time to attacking them.

Also, the spell system is a novel concept (you must summon your spell in the middle of real time battle, so you have to be quick and prepared), but it falls flat because it's next to impossible to pull off a spell in the allotted time. And spell attacks? Well, don't bother because you're better off hitting a chicken with a pea from 300 feet than hitting a baddie with a spell attack.

And is there anything more annoying than running around through a jumping level with two cartoon idiots with shoddy AI tagging along behind me? I've heard that Donald and Goofy are supposed to learn as the game progresses, but do they have to start them at 'complete morons'?

"Kingdom Hearts" is a risky game that both succeeds and fails. In its efforts to be unique and ingenious, the idea of having fun got muddled, leaving a great idea with a weak shell on which the foundation lies. 

That doesn't mean I don't recommend "Kingdom Hearts." After all is said and done, I'm still constantly finding time to play some more and hoping for a sequel. I just hope the sequel can fix some of the problems that plague the current game. And more Donald-Goofy stuff. They never get old.

Everyone is encouraged to attend these events which are free of charge. 

Patrons will enjoy the interactive series in conjunction with the current art exhibition of Unexpected Selections, from the Martin Z. Marguiles Collection: Art from 1985 to Present. Other pieces in the Martin Z. Marguiles Collection include FIU's permanent Sculpture Park of 68 pieces displayed throughout the University Park campus. 

Unexpected Selections, the Martin Z. Marguiles Collection, will continue to be on exhibition at the Art Museum through Dec 4. 

You can look forward to new art exhibitions featuring the graduating Fall and Spring BFA students. The exhibitions will be from Dec. 15 to Dec. 25, 2002 and then April 25 to May 7, 2003. The Master of Fine Arts student exhibition will begin March 24 and run until April 9, 2003. 

On Oct. 23 at 6:30p.m. the upcoming "Wednesday After Hours" series will be highlighting a poetry reading by the Dante Alighieri Society of Miami. Artist Raffaele Ammavuta, along with FIU Italian professors Magda Novelli Pearson and Claudio Pastor will read a selection of contemporary Italian poetry in both the Italian and English languages. 

Additionally on Nov. 20, art historian and contributor to the Art in America, Roni Feinstein will conduct an informative lecture. 

The first night-reception, held last Sep. 25, featured a wine tasting event. The presentation included a mock tour of the world's greatest vineyards with Wine News Executive Editor and Carafe publisher Todd M. Wernstrom. 

That event was made possible with the support of Canadaiga Wine, Moselland, Andrew Harris Vineyards, and Barton Guestier. 

Another event in the series, which took place Oct. 9, included the presentation of ancient Japanese drumming performed by the Fushu Daiko Company. 

Formed in 1990 by Charles and Yoshiko Cane, the Fushu Daiko continues the powerful tradition of the art of Japanese drumming, called Taiko, which dates back to 2600 years ago. 

Fushu Daiko puts on an energetic and pulse-pounding show playing in beautifully and carefully synchronized and choreographed movements.  

I attended the Fushu Daiko drum performance and was astonished by the number of people that attended the event and enjoyed the art exhibition. 

Student Nadia Mahabir, who was among those present, said: "I loved it. I follow Japanese drumming, it's very energetic." 

Whether you love art, music, poetry, performances or lectures, in addition to meeting new people or enjoying a night with friends and family, "Wednesday After Hours" offers a forum for the community to continue its support and promotion of the arts.

Headline: Exotic "Monsoon" weds family, economic issues
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
After being featured in a few independent theaters this summer, the Indian film "Monsoon Wedding" is out on DVD.  The foreign film, directed by Mira Nair, is a tribute to the colorfulness and sensuality of Indian culture.  

If you are one of those individuals who can't walk and chew gum at the same time, then this film is not an option because reading subtitles and understanding the movie plot might be too much of a challenge.  However, if you love to take risks and you are tired of the same formulaic  Hollywood film packed with gorgeous looking stars that can't really act, then this is the perfect movie to watch.

Unlike American wedding films, this movie goes beyond a superficial focus on the stress and financial nuisances that weddings cause. Instead, it takes the romantic theme of a wedding in order to bring together all of the characters and explore issues such as sex before marriage, incest, homosexuality and adultery among others. 

The daughter of a light-skinned, upper-middle class, Punjabi family is about to be married, and during the five-day-long traditional wedding rituals, dark secrets arise. All the characters are caught up in their own psychological troubles, ranging from the bride who does not love the groom and is having an affair with a married man; to Hemant Rai, the Americanized groom who lives in Houston and barely knows the bride; to the bride's cousin, Ria Verma, who was sexually abused as a child by her uncle-in-law, and is portrayed by the actress Shefali Shetty.

Naseeruddin Shah, who plays Lalit Verma, the bride's father, delivers a wonderful performance as the loving father who is willing to sacrifice anything for his children, and the heroic uncle who chooses to protect his niece, Ria.  

The film is filled with fascinating rituals that evoke all of the livelihood and spiciness of Punjabis, who are known in India for their pompous weddings.  

From a joyful, women-only henna ceremony where rich-colored dresses and red lips are magical, to a touching scene where a woman with a gypsy-like voice sings the traditional farewell to the bride, all of the festivities will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride full of liquor, tears and dancing.  

Although the film is very intimate and focuses on the family issues, it also touches upon the economic boom that the dot.com revolution has brought in India. 

This is how we get P.K. Dubey, the wedding planner played by Vijay Raaz, a member of a lower social class who walks around with cell phones and beepers and whose mother trades stock. We get the exotic diversity of the "new India" as the film goes from expensive golf courses to the controlled-chaos that governs the crowded streets of New Delhi.

The wedding scene brings a warm finale where everybody is laughing and dancing to the beats of techno music underneath a red tent, while the heavy rains of the monsoon fall. In the end, after laughing and shedding tears, "Monsoon Wedding" will allow you to taste a flavor that is very hard to find in American films.  It will leave you in high spirits and with a completely new perception of Indian culture.

Headline: Dance Now! ensemble covers classic, modern styles
Author: Angela Castillo
&nbsp;
"Canción del Arbol del Olvido" ("The Song of the Tree of Forgetfulness") is one of the memorable tunes that plays as the background of a duet called "Three Dances of Alone," directed by Hannah Baumgarten and Diego Salterini. They are part of Dance Now!, a progressive dance ensemble that will be performing at VH 100 In-Studio Theater at 8 p.m. on Oct. 25 and 26. Ticket prices are $8 for students and seniors, $10 in advanced, and $12 at the door. 

Dance Now! and its 11 member troupe sweat blood every other day during three hour rehearsals held at temple Menorah. All you hear in the studio is piano or classical music, the non-stop "smile" instructions and 1,000 mph breathing of the enthusiastic dancers who are both passionate and devoted. 

"For me, dancing is freedom. I just can't imagine my life without dancing. It helps me in my everyday life," said dancer Lizbeth Michel, 27. 

"What I like more about dancing is that it directs people in a physical basis and it's a great work out. It's a different level of intimacy working with somebody you don't know. You come here, and all of a sudden you get into each other's mind while dancing," Bret Elkind, a fellow dancer, said. 

Their natural and vibrant movements reflect not only their grace and beauty, but also their belief that contemporary dancing is a way of exploring their souls and dreams. It isn't all about spirituality and soul-searching though. They are also very professional.

  Dance Now! provides a total fusion of dance styles in its original choreographies. 

"This is a combination of high athleticism and high art put together," Director Hannah Baumgarten said. 

Dance Now! is a non-profit organization that is sponsored by the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Board of City Commissioners, and the Miami Beach Cultural Arts Council and the City Commissioners. 

This year, Dance Now! will be having two major concert seasons for the first time in Dade and Broward counties. 

The ensemble has also been invited to perform in Phoenix, Ariz. on March 2003 at Guest Choreographer Michael Uthoff's Dance Theater. The performance will offer a mixture of new works as well as pieces from its repertoire. The new pieces are a combination of a modern dance work that features music inspired by the contemporary classical work of famous artist Egon Schiele, and an abstract work filled with texture and organic movement called "Ding An Sich." The ensemble will also present internationally renowned director and choreographer Michael Uthoff's "Three Dances of Alone," which expresses the dynamics of being alone, yet not lonely.

 Dance Now's evening promises to give their audience a taste of different dance styles that everyone can enjoy. 

"It's a diverse compilation of modern dance, jazz and ballet," Coordinator of Events (and a dancer herself) Algeria Bridges, 28, said. Dance Now! is a trip through the possibilities of music and the human body.
