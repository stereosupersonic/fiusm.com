Headline: Zalava of Mars Volta fame dabbles in dub
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When the term "dub/ reggae" is mentioned, one usually envisions a small studio in Kingston no larger than a two door garage. Master producers Lee "Scratch" Perry and his Royal Highness Osborne "King Tubby" Ruddock sit in on all-night sessions mixing and re-mixing tracks, manipulating the controls of the sound board with the swipe of a hand. 

They add and drop echoes, delays, reverb and sample thunder crashes like dub gods.  

This is dub/reggae, an often slow and atmospheric sound with deep bass lines that explode from your sound system, leaving your head rattling like a bobble-head doll. Considering the fact that this particular form of classical artistry is done on studio sound boards, it leaves the mind wondering, "What would a modern dub band sound like?"

Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, on bass and Cedric Bixler Zalava  (formally of At The Drive In and more recently Mars Volta), on drums, teamed up with El Paso native Jeremy Ward, playing guitar and legendary Long Beach Dub All-Stars groove man Ikey Owens, on keyboards, to create the super team known as Defacto.

The band's first official studio album, Megaton Shot Blast (out on GSL Records) sits in a class of its own, showing true genre-straddling wizardry. 

By using a dub motif as the base, the band fuses jazz and Latin salsa with electronica to create a hurricane of sound that comes crashing through your headphones leaving you in disbelief.

The album opens with the ironically titled "Manual Dexterity," a mysterious dub track that seems impossible to figure out. A haunting toy piano echoes in the distance as an almost Pong-like creates a musical euphoria. Faster tempos run through "Cordova," with its heavily jazz-influenced piano solo that easily extends passed the seven minute mark.  

The track "Rodeche Defacto," has a hard mix of maracas, congas and a mind-blowing trumpet. Being one of the few tracks with any form of lyrics, it's definitely reminiscent of salsa nights on the beach.

Although Megaton Shot Blast may not be as easy to find as cruising down to your neighborhood record store, it can be ordered from the west-coast based independent record label, Gold Standard Labs (www.goldstandardlabs.com).

Defacto was scheduled to release a new album earlier this year on the Beastie Boys run Grand Royal Records but due to the company's recent bankruptcy, the project was shelved. Do not be disappointed, the band's semi-live follow-up album "Legende Du Scopion a Quatre Queues" can still be found in stores. 

Members Omar Rodriguez Lopez and Cedric Bixler Zalava still keep close ties with their former At the Drive-In comrades. 

Guitarist Jim Ward and bassist Paul Himojos will be re-releasing Defacto's original EP, "The Glove," on their new label, Restart Records, in the near future.

Headline: Team America tackles big issues with mini actors
Author: Heather Brummer / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Say what you want about the creators of "South Park," but those guys know how to make a point. Over the course of its seven year run, "South Park" has managed to distinguish itself by making fun of just about everything, including the untouchables: politics, religion, sexuality and everything that falls inbetween. Its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are now attempting a new gimmick -marionettes- in their upcoming live action movie, "Team America." 

The storyline is not too far fetched from what you might expect to see in an action film - an international police force embarks on a mission to save the world after learning that one of the characters is distributing weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. 

What's the catch? Parker and Stone decided to skip the hassle of working with actors and employed an all-marionette cast in their film, an idea that was easier thought up than put into action. 

The 22-inch "actors" were created and designed specifically for the script. They can raise their eyebrows, open their mouths and have fully functional jaws. 

With a few clothing and hair changes, the 90- plus marionettes manage to serve as a cast of 250 different characters. 

They even travel the world - a scale model of the world, that is. To create the film's scenery every minature location was built to scale. 

Though painstaking, the work really pays off as it brings the marionettes to life, using a live cast to give each one a unique voice. 

Yet with all of the detail that went into making the movie as realistic as possible, one factor was intentionally overlooked - the visibility of the marionette's strings. The creators decided it was more important for the wooden actors to move realistically than it was for the shots to be technically perfect. 

The result of their hard work is a humorous and removed look at a much more serious topic, showing that a cast of marionettes can be used to make a film parodying of washed up celebrities and weapons of mass destruction. 

In real life, a movie of this nature is more difficult to get passed the censors. But Stone and Parker learned something early on that has launched their careers: if you want to make a strong statement, do so using a non-threatening method. 

In this case, it's a marionette cast; in "South Park," it's animated fourth graders. This isn't a new concept. 

Anyone who has watched cartoons in recent years can see that they have become increasingly politically charged. And it doesn't seem to be a coincidence that a film involving weapons of mass destruction is scheduled to open just weeks before the presidential elections. 

Stone and Parker aren't novices when it comes to making political statements. Their short-lived 2001 series, "That's My Bush," gently parodied the president and his life in the White House before it was cancelled due to the events of Sept. 11.

Headline: Cell phone users spending millions on ring tones
Author: Jenee Osterheldt / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - When Cassie Keller gets a phone call, a lot more happens than an archaic "ring, ring."

Instead, her cell phone launches into this: meow-meow-meow-meow, meow-meow-meow-meow ...

Right. The "Meow Mix" TV jingle.

That's how it rings for the unidentified callers, says Keller, a senior who attends Fort Hays State University via the Internet from her Fairway, Kan., home.

Just about everyone in her cell phonebook has been assigned a distinct ring. For her mom, there's a rodeo song and her boss has an ambulance siren. She even has the Kansas Jayhawks fight song, and snippets from the movie "Office Space" and "Chappelle's Show." Then there's her personal favorite, "Build Me Up, Buttercup" by the Foundations.

"I like the fact that I can tell who is calling," Keller says. "If the phone is in the other room you can hear it and tell who is calling. It's funny. I have even had people request ringers; it's like you can give different personalities to different people."

Keller gets her ringers from her wireless provider, Sprint, as well as from Web sites like www.3gupload.com and www.matrixm.com. 

Most Web sites have a yearly fee that gives customers access to unlimited ringers, games and screensavers. Some even let you make your own ring tone. At www.3gforfree.com, you can pay $7 a year for unlimited downloads. Other sites, like matrixm.com, sell individual ring tones, starting at  $1; a few are offered for free. And you can access the sites from your PC or your cell phone, if your phone has Internet access.

U.S. cell phone owners spent more than $75 million on ring tones in 2003, according to research by In-Stat/MDR, a digital communications research firm. Researchers predict cell users will spend $146 million this year. 

They won't see any of Kristen Vincent's money.

"I think I would have a hard time paying for ring tones," says Vincent, 39, a Hallmark associate product manager. "You have to pay to download music already, gas prices are already higher and with people just trying to survive, it's just hard to see myself paying for a ring tone."

Vincent says younger, hipper people might think differently and she thinks it is a great option to have. But she's happy with the 40-plus tones standard in her Verizon phone.  

"I have never heard anyone with the same ring as mine," Vincent says of her Dragnet-like  tone. "I'm unique, and it gets a lot of laughs when people hear it. I like that."

Keller says it's the individuality that fuels the ringer trend.

"It has to be in the same vein of expressing yourself through fashion and stuff," Keller, 23, says. "When you have a ringer and it makes people go `What is that,' it's fun."

Wireless providers are broadening the alternatives to give cell users plenty of creativity when it comes to customizing their phones.

Sprint, the first mobile carrier to offer master recording tones, just released two new ring options this week: pro football player voice ringers and BlingTones.

For $2.50 a ringer, you can download (www.sprintpcs.com) the voices of NFL hot shots like Tony Gonzalez and Daunte Culpepper. That same price will get you a BlingTone. Sprint has partnered with some of hip-hop's hottest producers and DJs like Rockwilder and Hi-Tek to deliver the BlingTone ringers. 

Hip-hop is not only dominating the Billboard charts, but it also dominates the ringer world as well. At Sprint, Beyonce has achieved platinum status, with ringers like "Baby Boy," "Crazy in Love" and "Naughty Girl" being downloaded more than a million times. And 50 Cent has been downloaded more than 500,000 times, giving him gold status.

In the future we'll see even more innovative ways to customize cell phones, says Nancy Beaton, Sprint general manager of wireless music and personalization.

The next step in mobile customization is AAC sound, which has CD-like quality, Beaton says. In addition, there will probably be video ringers that not only play your favorite song, but also show a short clip of the video as well.

"It's all about personalization," Beaton says. "People buy ringers to customize their phones. They want ringers that are popular, the songs that they enjoy and they want ringers that have a special place for them."

Headline: Volleyball woes continue as Golden Panthers drop seventh in a row in fifth set loss to South Alabama
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers had the Jaguars right were it wanted them, up 25-23 in the third game with and a chance at a 3-0 sweep. But with seventeen tie scores and nine lead changes in the third game, FIU lost its momentum and on its way to losing the game which ended up causing the match.

After winning the first two games 30-23 and 30-27 respectively, FIU lost the next three 37-35, 30-24 and 15-13 on Oct. 3 at Pharmed Arena. The loss dropped the Golden Panthers record to 1-12 for the season and 0-3 in Sun Belt Conference play.

Coach Cookie Stevens was unhappy with the way her team let the game slip away.

"The first two games were aggressive and after the third game, we should have come back aggressive and full of confidence but we didn't," said Stevens. "We should not have been in that position. The way we played the first two games we should have won the third."

FIU was led by Ruth Fleming and Anna Dmoska who finished with 20 and 10 kills respectively in the match. Dyionna Smith had 10 kills and 37 assists marking her sixth double double of the season.

The Golden Panthers out hit South Alabama .235-.115 in game one. In game two, FIU held the Jaguars to a match-low .026 attack percentage. Dmowska had seven kills in the game two to lead all players.

USA's momentum drifted into the fourth game as the team used a balanced attack in game four by having five players tallied three or more kills led by Whitney Sanders who had four kills in the game. Sanders also led the Jaguars in with 19 kills, 19 digs and five blocks.

FIU played its second fifth set match in a row. The match got off with an early 6-6 tie but USA pulled away with five consecutive points. FIU could not go away though as the team fought off three match points to get as close as 14-13 but after a USA timeout, the Jaguars picked up the deceive point to win the game 15-13.

In the final two losing sets, FIU was held .200 by the Jaguars defense. 

Stevens is looking forward to getting her team on the right track.

"We need to start putting together a string of points at the right time and fight a little harder," Stevens said.

The next home game for FIU will take place Oct. 8 at 7 p.m. against Western Kentucky at Pharmed Arena.

Headline: FIU loses thriller to Ragin' Cajun
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the score tied at 34, 1:42 remaining in the game: FIU forced the Ragin' Cajuns to punt the ball on fourth and four to have a chance to work the two minute drill and win the game. 

Things didn't work FIU's way as a substitution penalty gave new life to Louisiana Lafayette. Cajun's quarterback completed a 23-yard pass to Chester Johnson on the following play, setting up a 41-yard field goal with 29 seconds left in the game.

The Golden Panthers had one more opportunity to drive the ball down the field and tie the score with a field goal with 11 seconds to go, but a Josh Padrick pass bounced off the hands of wide receiver Chandler Williams around the 50 yard line for an interception. Antwain Spann returned the ball 31 yards setting up a closing touchdown by UL.

Missed opportunities hurt FIU throughout the game, something that frustrated Head Coach Don Strock.

"Obviously we didn't get it done. We had opportunities and we didn't take advantage of them," said Strock after the game.

The Cajuns got off to an early start as cornerback Travis Bass picked off a Padrick pass and returned it 36 yards for a touchdown.

The Golden Panthers answered back on a four-play drive that ended in a 44-yard field goal by Adam Moss, after what would have been a touchdown pass from Padrick to Williams got called back due to a penalty.

UL received the kick off by Moss and drove the ball 80 yards down the field for a two-yard touchdown run by Dwight Lindon. The Cajun ate up over seven minutes on the clock in a 15 yard drive to put the team up 14-3 with 11:16 left in the first half.

FIU's offense proved ineffective in the following series that led to a punt by Doug Jones. UL picked up good field position that led to a 47-yard field goal by UL's Sean Comiskey.

Struggling on offense through the first two quarters, FIU went to the new secret weapon and the hero of the first game in Sam Smith to capture a touchdown drive. Smith caught a 17-yard pass from Padrick to put FIU within seven, at 17-10.

Cornerback Greg Moss lifted the defense on the following series as he returned a school record 77-yard interception for a touchdown. After an extra point by Adam Moss, FIU tied the score at 17.

The score would not go tie into halftime however, as UL would prove effective in the two minute drill driving the ball 54 yards for a touchdown.

The third quarter opened with an FIU defensive stop. Padrick, on the following drive, drove the Golden Panthers 67 yards to cap off a 10-yard touchdown pass to Harold Leath tying the score at 24 after another Adam Moss extra point.

Both teams later scored touchdowns on half back draws, Lindon for UL and Rashod Smith to put the game at 34-34.After the game, Strock was ticked off at the FIU defensive line.

"Our pass rush was non existent and that's something we worked on all week," Strock said. 

Added safety Nick Turnbull, "Our defensive linemen weren't penetrating. I don't think the best team won."

FIU kept up with the Cajun, the first Division I-A opponent to play at the FIU stadium.

"We had an opportunity to win and not do it, its very discouraging," Strock said.

Penalties hurt FIU, in particular the one on fourth and four that would have given FIU the ball with a chance to win the game.

"As a football team you can't have penalties," Rashod Smith said.

Added Padrick, "we always seem to get penalties on the worst occasions."

Linebacker Lance Preston saw how close FIU is to competing with Division I-A schools.

"It makes the loss harder to take," Preston said.

Despite two interceptions, Padrick had a solid game finishing with 265 and two touchdowns. Receiver Cory McKinney tied the school record of ten catches that was set last game by Sam Smith.  

Strock stood by his QB after the game.

"He made some big plays and kept us in the football game. He made a couple of mistakes but the interception at the end wasn't his fault. The early interception put us behind 7-0, but he fought back and got us right back into the game. That's how you judge a quarterback," Strock said.

On defense, John Haritan led with ten tackles and Greg Moss suffered a concussion and making him unavailable for the second half of the game. 

FIU's next game will be Oct. 9 on the road against Stephen F. Austin in Nacogdoches, Texas.

Headline: Men's s soccer suffers tough defeat to USF
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In a hard fought match on Oct. 3 at FIU Soccer Stadium, the Golden Panthers came up just short losing 2-1. FIU took on the University of South Florida, which came into Miami in an effort of dropping the Golden Panthers below .500 as the Bulls only trailed for six minutes this season, coming into Sunday's game.

The Golden Panthers got off to a quick start when Fernando Plentz capitalized on the one-one opportunity with USF goalkeeper Dane Brenner, when he found the left side of the net and recorded his team leading fifth goal of the season in the tenth minute, giving FIU the early 1-0 lead. 

"We had chances, we scored one early, then [the team] just laid back," said coach Karl Kremser

The Bulls then responded with two goals of their own, as they went into halftime with a 2-1 lead. 

Brandon Streicher first connected on a 25-yard free kick, which the Golden Panthers goalkeeper Shawn Crowe had momentarily, but lost the handle and provided for a 1-1 tie in the 28th minute. 

Kremser didn't see the Crowe bobble coming.

"Shawn is a much, much better goalkeeper than that, he doesn't make that mistake everyday," Kresmer said.

USF took a 2-1 lead when Rodrigo Hidalgo fired a bullet past Crowe for the game-winning goal in the 39th minute of the match. 

The game provided its share of excitement and was loaded with physical play from start to finish. The teams were issued a total of five yellow cards and were called for twenty-nine fouls. 

"We shot right at them and I was happy with our effort. That's the best we've played all year," Kremser commented on the physicality of the game.

Despite the rough play the Golden Panthers saw numerous opportunities but were unable to take advantage and tie the game. 

"We moved the ball well, but we just need to move a little quicker and need to cut down on the mistakes,' Kremser said. 

FIU out shot the Bulls 15-11, with a 10-5 advantage in the second half which included a couple of open shots at the goal when goalkeeper Brenner made two brilliant saves late in the match. 

"Man of the match for them was their goalkeeper, I thought he played super," Kremser said.

The Golden Panthers will complete its four-game home stand on Oct. 8 at 7 p.m.

Headline: Women's soccer win two Sun Belt Conference games in three days
Author: Ana Sanchez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers kicked off the Sun Belt Conference with a 3-2 win at the FIU soccer stadium against Middle Tennessee on Oct. 1. At minute 1:42 Tennessee got on the scoreboard first. However, a free kick near midfield by Defender Megan Meade tied the game at 1-1 in the sixth minute. 

Following a shot by forward Janessa Taddei, forward Whitney Rezendes happened to be in front of the net and scored to give FIU a 2-1 lead. 

Rezendes after sitting out the first seven games due to a collarbone injury scored her first goal of the season during what was just her second game. 

"It was my first home game and we had a big crowd, overall we came out here to prove ourselves to the crowd and to our coaches that we can play," said Rezendes. "We can [win] because we've been lagging in some games that we should have won but we lost."

The Blue Raiders tied the game with a shot by Kaley Forest at the end of the first half sending the game 2-2 into halftime. 

FIU came out strong in the second half as Midfielder Valerie Patrick scored a goal with help from an assist by Carly Goldrich. 

FIU 2, MKU 1

FIU landed a 2-1 win at home game against Middle Kentucky on Sunday Oct. 3 picking up the second Sun Belt Conference win of the season.

 Sophomore midfielder Valerin Patrick scored the first goal of the game 39 seconds in giving her the second goal this season. Coach Everton Edwards was pleased with the Golden Panthers early offense.

 "We got on top of them and we scored early." 

The goal provided intensity to the FIU players. 

"It's important because it gets the intensity going for the whole game. We need to win and I'm confident we are going to keep on wining because last year we didn't too well," Patrick said.

Forward Chanelle Crosby kicked a goal at minute 21 of the game to give FIU a 2-0 lead. 

With four seconds left in the game Kentucky scored its only goal of the game. 

Coach Everton Edwards pointed out after the game that two goals is not a comfortable situation for his team. 

"It's a danger zone. I wanted to get at least three up but we didn't. The basic thing is that we got a win," said Edwards who was pleased with the way his team played both games in a three-day span.

Everton will work with his players in order to achieve better discipline in the second half of games.

 "During the second half we lost a bit of composure, I think we need to work on that and some people need to set it up a bit more," Edwards said.

 The win puts FIU 2-0 in the Sun Belt conference and 4-6 on the regular season schedule.

Headline: Football improves from last season
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For those involved with the Golden Panther football team, as well as its supporters, there's little reason to hang your head after Saturday's game against Louisiana-Lafayette. FIU lost. Go ahead and let out an expletive followed by a collective sigh. Done? Good, now get over it.

The first game played against a Division I-A opponent at The Cage turned out to be a high-scoring thriller of a home-opener before a crowd of 10,022, all of which should be motivated to continue to watch what's become a very exciting team. 

Though only two games have been played this season, they've been nail-biters down to the final moments. More importantly, the Golden Panthers (1-1) have been in a position to win them both. 	

While it's still just two games into the schedule, the casual fan now knows what the coaches and players have known since the off-season: This Golden Panther team is better . . . dare I say, good. 

At least good enough to execute a fourth quarter comeback on the road and win in overtime against a tough I-AA YSU squad, then go three weeks without playing a single down and give an even tougher I-A opponent a run for their money.  This same Louisiana-Lafayette team manhandled the Golden Panthers 43-10 just a year ago, has to feel lucky to escape The Cage with a win.

Though the loss dropped the Panthers to 1-1, the improvement on both sides of the ball is undeniable. 

"We had opportunities to make plays tonight and that's the most disappointing part about it," Coach Don Strock said after the loss. "But we'll learn from those mistakes and hopefully we'll get better week-by-week."

The disappointment is evident and inevitable. Anytime you lose a game in which you had chances to win it should be a cause for concern, especially when untimely penalties and turnovers played key roles in the loss. UL's first points of the game came when Josh Padrick threw a careless pass to tight end Sam Smith. 

Travis Bass jumped the route, intercepted the ball and took it back 36 yards for a touchdown just 4:19 into the game. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, with the score knotted at 34-all and 1:42 left in regulation, the Golden Panther defense had seemingly stopped the Cajun attack on fourth down with four yards to go. This would have forced a punt and given FIU the chance to win the game with a field goal. 

But a yellow hanky, thrown for an inexcusable substitution penalty, gave the Ragin' Cajuns new life and they capitalized by adding three points on Sean Comiskey's third field goal of the night.

What was most impressive was the resilience of Padrick, Cory McKennie, Rashod Smith and the rest of the offense.  Nearly every time that UL scored and tried to pull away, the Golden Panthers answered with points of their own. 

"I don't think there is any question that we have as much talent as the team we played tonight," Strock said. "But they made the plays when it counted and we didn't." 

The penalties and turnovers will have to be eliminated, but we've now seen that the talent is there and we have a better idea of how far the program has gone in a short time. 

The main difference between this year's squad and that of the past is that you can't help but feel that the Golden Panthers are in every game now. With one of the toughest match-ups on the schedule now a thing of the past, it'll be exciting to watch FIU try and build toward its first winning season to date. 

Do yourself a favor and go watch this team play.

Headline: Search for the perfect age results in sublime regression
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Up to a certain age, we are all constantly prepared, groomed, warned and fixated on the day we will finally become adults. There is a small, indefinable grace period. Then we are bombarded with tools, ideas, mantras, and methods on how to become as childlike as possible. 

How can people go from looking forward to wit and wisdom to recoiling in horror at the prospect of losing the best days of their life?  How can they go from wanting to lose all of their baby fat so quickly to wanting to inject that fat back into their wrinkling face?

With a window of satisfaction and contentment in life so small, this leaves one question: what exactly is the "perfect" age, and what happens if you missed it? 

A natural assumption would be the college years. College seems to be the final threshold before adulthood. It can be viewed as the best of both worlds. It's a time where terms like "Thoreau" and "beer bong" can be used in the same sentence. However, for many the desire to break loose from financial dependence and to begin a career can gnaw viciously at them like termites on Pinocchio. Also, the stress of holding down multiple responsibilities can resemble a toothpick holding up an unabridged dictionary. Perhaps the perfect age is earlier in life.

The cliché goes, "high school was the best years of my life." If this is true, I may have to make an appointment with a bottle of cyanide. Things remembered most about high school include pettiness, insecurity and pimples that could be used to direct traffic. While there were good times, it would be a fallacy to call it a barrel of laughs. 

Then, it hit me: the downfall of everyone is puberty. Before you're worrying about what the opposite sex is thinking about you, you're free to enjoy the simple pleasures. You're old enough to distinguish right and wrong and are able to understand the significance of art and current events. At the same time, though, you're favorite activity is spinning around in circles until your sick and your biggest concern is if you're mom is cooking her "specialty." In retrospect, that stuff was pretty nasty.   

Now that the perfect age is lost, what can we do? Look forward to endless days of working, paying bills, raising children  and then dying? There must be a time when we can return to this state of bliss.

Senility seems like a good option, but the transition into it seems rather grueling, upsetting and anything but smooth. So until there's some sort of technology that can make that change last about three seconds, we'll all have to make do with meditation, setting aside time to reflect, and of course, lots of coloring.

In a time where young people are stigmatized as apathetic, aimless and without concern for the workings of government, the explosion of political activism on campus has been a welcome challenge to that sentiment.

Last week, both democratic and republican rallies were held at the University Park campus in preparation for the first of three presidential debates. 

Students, community leaders and enthusiasts alike, gathered in order to support their respective candidate and show how important voting is. People from both sides were carrying signs and handing out bumper stickers to passers by.

The recent flare-up of political activity on campus sends a strong message that there is a rising demand for focus on young voters. Many are new to the political process and are just starting to form their own opinions and leanings. 

This kind of activism is not only helpful to those finding their niche, but also to those who already have formed strong opinions and are looking for others to share those opinions with.

 It also sends a message to those who are still indifferent and believe their opinions don't matter. The fact is they do matter and it's the votes of these young undecided voters that will make the election this year a success for one candidate.

Subheadline: Grad student finds little to look forward to in either candidate's presidency.

&nbsp;
To the Editor:

The two-party system has become a mainstay of American politics. 

For nearly two centuries the American public has had to choose between two contenders for the White House and this has remained unchallenged from generation to generation.

In the past times this may not have been a problem because candidates had differing views on an array of important subjects but as we move toward this year's crucial election we find that the American people are left with essentially one choice. 

You can call it voting for the lesser of two evils, or casting your ballot for anyone but Bush, or deciding on voting for a candidate that is less likely to trouble your conscience after the elections are completed. In the end though, we as a nation, will lose. 

George W. Bush and John Kerry offer little hope for Americans. 

We are looking at an election where both candidates provide almost identical views on the most important subjects facing this nation. 

We are offered no concrete plans by either candidate as to how to end the stalemate in Iraq. 

We have an army where our soldiers are being shot down by the day in a vain attempt to spread liberty and freedom to  people who never asked for it. 

This is not just occurring in Iraq but also in Afghanistan. The long forgotten Afghani people  have suffered through war and terror for the past twenty-five years in one imperialist regime after the other. 

 There is no plan of action to help this country, now run by corrupt tribal chieftains and  governed by a puppet president who cannot leave the capital city without the US Army flanking his sides. 

Amid all of this is the long forgotten Osama bin Laden, the one man we can agree to hate, but who disappeared as the target of the Bush administration for the possibility of finding mythical WMDs in Iraq and to take down its dictator,  to whom we gave WMDs  in the first place. 

All the while US soldiers continue to come home in body bags; the Bush administration continues calling the Iraqi debacle a victory for freedom and liberty. 

Just who is free and has liberty in Iraq seems to be a very subjective idea as thousands of Iraqis have perished in our army's charge for freedom  and their names and tragedies are never mentioned on our nightly news. 

John Kerry on the other hand has been exactly what the Republicans could hope for in an opposing candidate. He is a dry and boring man who has no plan of action himself to change things in Iraq. 

All he can muster is the claim that he will do better than Bush in Iraq and will look to draw international support for stabilizing the region. 

His plan then is essentially to ask the British, French and Germans to have their sons and daughters come home in coffins as well. 

Kerry gives us no hope of ending the stalemate in Iraq by doing the one sensible thing any person with any sort of intelligence would deem the best plan of action: to pull out. 

No, instead we as a nation will be duped by both candidates and their respective parties into thinking that the horrible anarchy and chaos in Iraq is only the precursor to freedom and prosperity and not what it obviously is;  complete and utter disaster.

I wish I could say there seems to be some hope in a  third party candidate but being someone who thinks realistically, although reluctantly at times, there does not seem to be any hope in this election for the betterment of our nation or for the world. 

We as Americans have to demand change in our political system. 

We cannot be satisfied by these candidates who serve only their own agendas and the agendas of those with the largest wallets. 

If we do not look to change this political party system then no matter who we vote the winner of any election, as a nation will continue to be fooled into believing whatever babble streams from the mouths of these politicians. Ultimately in the end it will be the American people who lose.

Headline: College political leaders face off (continued)
Subheadline: Bush failed to defend record as chief
Author: James Valle / FIU College Democrats President
&nbsp;
Last Thursday night's Presidential Debate was the most momentous event in this roller coaster campaign.  President Bush had a real opportunity to put John Kerry away and have smooth sailing toward reelection. Bush was leading by five to 12 points in every major poll and Kerry was having difficulty connecting with voters.  What a difference 90 minutes makes.

From the initial handshake, where Bush blatantly pulled away from Kerry early, it was clear he did not want to be there.  Going into the debate, Bush needed to accomplish two things: adequately defend his record as commander in chief and continue to have voters questions Kerry's ability to win the war on terror. He failed miserably at both.

Kerry had articulate, educated responses to moderator Jim Lehrer's questions all night.  He questioned Bush's decision to rush into war in Iraq under faulty intelligence.  Without directly saying it, Kerry made it clear Bush is the real flip-flopper in the race. Iraq had WMDs. Now it doesn't. Saddam had ties with Osama bin Laden. Now he doesn't.  

Bush once misspoke, stopping half sentence when he confused Saddam Hussein with bin Laden.  Kerry even caught him claiming that Saddam, not bin Laden, had attacked us on 9/11. 

This debate proved that without a script or Dick Cheney telling him what to say, George W. Bush gets that "deer caught in the headlights" look. It's no wonder he needed Cheney by his side when he caved into pressure to testify before the 9/11 Commission.

All night long, Kerry looked presidential, and in these debates body language speaks volumes.  Bush was slumped over the podium making juvenile facial expressions while Kerry wowed America with his performance.  

Kerry made nuclear proliferation his number one priority, he outlined his plan for bringing home our troops from Iraq and made it clear that no country on this planet would be needed to approve President Kerry's plan to defend our nation. Kerry's performance brought new life back into his campaign and this election.  The latest Newsweek poll has Kerry ahead by 2 points with the Gallup poll showing him tied with Bush at 49-49. These next two debates are now absolutely critical for Bush.  

With many voters giving Kerry a second look, for Bush to win reelection he needs to show a mastery of domestic issues and defend his record on them.  That's difficult to do when 5 million Americans lost their health insurance on his watch, when he is presiding over the greatest job loss since the Great Depression and while millions of high school students can't go to college because Pell Grants and government aid are being slashed across the board.  

Voters have clearly sided with Kerry on the domestic issues so far and combined with the fact that Kerry is known for his strong finishes, trouble is on the horizon for President Bush and the Republicans.

Headline: College political leaders face off on debate highs, lows
Subheadline: The sparkle of Kerry will soon fade
Author: By Juan F. D’Arce, Jr. / FIU College Republicans President
&nbsp;
The upcoming debate should be rather interesting, as it will delineate the reality between President Bush and Senator Kerry.  

As we saw in the first debate, more truths will come out and the sparkle that Senator Kerry seems to possess will greatly be extinguished. 

To be our commander in chief you must be an individual of great resolve, that is someone Sen. Kerry is not.

The Kerry point of view was rather poor; he kept calling the Iraq war unimportant, repeating this multiple times, eventually concluding that it was important. 

Here is a man promoting himself as the savior of the world if elected, and he still cannot take a stand on such a critical issue.  

If we are to believe that his future choices will be better than those he made in the past then we are truly in trouble and in for a rude awakening.

Our national security should not depend on the United Nations or any country.  

Realistically speaking, many of the nations Kerry mentions as potential allies do not hold our best interests in mind.  

Trying to sell the concept of forging a coalition with those who do not see eye to eye with us is plainly unreal and deceitful. 

America cannot depend on foreign powers to dictate our actions and foreign policy.  

It would be rather interesting to see a four-month tour member take a hands-on approach to war. 

In the next debate, America will see George W. Bush show why he is the president of the United States of America and not the president of the Haters of America.  

Furthermore, he will speak about issues, detail facts and drill Kerry on his many excuses.  

The job of the president of this country and defender of freedom is a serious one. For a serious job, you need a serious president in the White House.  

A serious man is a man who can take a stand and can stick to it, not a man who changes sides and issues as quickly as he can blink.

Headline: Critical issues find way into convocation
Author: Adriana Pereira / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The University Park Faculty Convocation, which took place last week on Oct. 1, recognized the University's top scholars and research achievements with Professor Christos Koulamas of the College of Business Administration taking home the prestigious Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty Award and its $10,000 cash prize.

Yet there was much going on during the three-hour ceremony, an FIU academic tradition. 

Two critically important issues - one spoken and the other unspoken - took center stage in a key note address on FIU's pursuit of a medical school and in a silent protest by faculty members over stalled union negotiations.

Faculty filled the seats of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center sporting an array of colorful academic regalia. 

Many wore stickers reading "FIU, Bargain Now!" and buttons declaring "UFF: An FIU Tradition." 

 "I believe the administration is stalling in its deliberations with the faculty union and this is a very sore spot for faculty," said Hedy First, Faculty Senate administrative assistant, after the event.

Conflicts arising in union negotiations have centered less on issues concerning money and more  job security, academic freedom and non-discrimination, according to the July report of FIU's United Faculty of Florida chapter. The UFF, which came to FIU in 1976, had served as the bargaining agent for faculty until  2003 when the contract between UFF and the Florida Board of Regents expired. Faculty members have been working without a contract since that time. 

Earlier this year, FIU recognized a local chapter of UFF and since then, the faculty has been bargaining with the university administration and the Board of Trustees for a new contract.

Alan Gummerson, president of the UFF and lecturer in the economics department said negotiations are now stalled. Faculty and administration have met only once, some feeling that the administration is dodging the issue. 

Faculty members say they wore the boldly worded stickers and buttons during Convocation in hopes of speeding up the negotiating process.

"I think it is important for the administration to know that the faculty are concerned," said James Sutton, an associate professor of English.  "It was an appropriate way to convey the message."

Because negotiations are still taking place, Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Rosenberg could not comment on many of the issues. 

"I'm confident there will be a resolution and I hope it's sooner rather than later," he managed to say.  

One notable absence from Faculty Convocation this year was University President Modesto A. Maidique. 

Speaking on the president's behalf was Rosenberg  who mentioned that Maidique had a prior commitment - an answer that didn't go over well with protestors.  

"The President has made the faculty angry," First said. "If he wants faculty support, he needs to get on the side of the faculty by not stalling any more and work with the union."

Faculty Senate chair Bruce Hauptli said the stickers and buttons pointed to a community-wide concern faculty have with these negotiations.

During the Sept. 21 Faculty Senate meeting, a motion regarding the halt in union negotiations was passed. The motion reads: "We urge additional attention to be given by the Administration to this important matter so that Faculty and Administrators can concentrate on other critical priorities."

"I'm very proud of the faculty-administration relationship and I'm sure the professionality and collegilality will continue," said Rosenberg.

Another issue during the event was the keynote address, this year delivered by Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, President and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges.

The university submitted its medical plan proposal to the Florida Board of Governors in July. 

The legislature has shown early signs of willingness to support the plan by funding FIU's $1 million Honors Pre Med collaboration with the University of South Florida and by providing funding for the new Molecular Biology and Social Sciences Building. 

Cohen said the world of medicine is "indicative of our turbulent times," and two battles FIU must win to overcome this turbulence are assuring that medical degrees are affordable and the problem of racial and cultural barriers that exist in medical education.

According to Cohen, America's medical school graduates are in debt for years as a result of student loans and those universities in search of medical schools must find ways to finance their program. He pointed out that one way to do this is by re-allocating existing resources.

"The future of a medical school in public education is challenged but ripe with opportunity," he said.

Sutton, acknowleding the importance of Cohen's speech during the medical school's transitional path and agreed with many of the points made. 

"[Dr. Cohen] was highly knowledgeable and professional, and I think he was able to give the faculty assembled a lesson in what we need to think about as we mutually converse in the years to come about our medical school initiative," Sutton said.

Faculty had much to say during an open question and answer period following Cohen's address. 

Many expressed concerns about how FIU will afford a medical school program and questioned where the university will find the money. Cohen's suggestion of re-allocating existing sources is just what many faculty members fear - that a medical school will drain resources from other parts of the University. 

"Faculty who have been here the longest feel that perhaps it is too soon for a medical school and we don't have the funding," First said. "Many feel our superstructure [staff, classrooms, budget, etc.] isn't strong enough for another major school."

Headline: Centers' research aids hurricane awareness
Author: Michelle Arean  / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This past hurricane season has been a rather active one. With Florida reeling from the combined punch of four hurricanes in six weeks, the International Hurricane Research Center (IHRC) at FIU is hard at work raising storm awareness while better learning the affects of a hurricane.

FIU's IHRC is composed of four distinct laboratories, each specializing in a particular area. These include the laboratory for Social Science Research; the Laboratory for Insurance, Financial and Economic Research; the Laboratory for Wind Engineering Research and the Laboratory for Coastal Research.

The Social Science Research Laboratory researchs what hurricanes do, how they affect the lives of the people  and how these people recover after a storm. This laboratory also researches what it costs the government to put hurricane warnings out and how much an evacuation will cost the local government. 

Hurricanes are estimated to cost an average of $5 billion worth of damage in an average year; this year the state of Florida has already sustained about $20 billion in damage.

IHRC'S total budget for 2003 was about $2.6 million, including research projects funded by local and state governments, according to Hugh Willoughby, Research professor and senior scientist at the International Hurricane Research Center.

The Laboratory for Insurance, Financial and Economic Research is now working on a model which the public will be able to use in order to calculate how much money they are supposed to receive from insurance agencies based on losses sustained in a hurricane, as early as the day after the storm.

The Laboratory for Wind Engineering chases hurricanes with instrumental wind towers. The instruments consist of 10- meter steel towers on trailers attached to pick-up trucks. 

The trucks are left where the hurricane is expected to hit and the towers are raised so they can read the proportions of the hurricane winds. The full impact of wind is then tested by taking the speed of the hurricane winds with  measuring instruments, recreating them later with wind machines. Model homes are then built and exposed to this fake wind in order to see how the houses react to the wind speed and what precautions can be taken in order to make people's homes safer. The University of Florida, Clemson University and FIU are partners in this wind research.

"The beauty of full scale testing is that now people who do insurance policies can know how the house will behave," said Willoughby.

The Laboratory for Coastal Research conducts research on beach erosion caused by hurricanes and the vulnerability of the coastal areas during a storm. 

Laser technology is used to measure ocean depths and how much erosion was caused by storms. 

The annual National Healthy Beaches Campaign is also conducted by this laboratory.

All of these laboratories aid the National Hurricane Center which tracks storms, configures building codes and evacuation plans and interprets how storms affect the environment.

"We're not all going to move out of Florida [because of the hurricanes], so we have to learn how to live with them," said Willoughby.
