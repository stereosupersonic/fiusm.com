Headline: Dave Barry honors Kaufman with humor
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Leonard Kaufman was a man who enjoyed laughing. In his daughter, Michelle Kaufman's opinion, her father was almost as funny as her husband. And her husband, humorist and Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry is pretty funny.

In a night where the conversation bounced from politics to boogers and ended in a dramatic understanding of the relationship between men and woman. An Evening with Dave Barry honored Professor Leonard "Lenny" Kaufman with what he liked best: making people laugh.

What could have been the typical stroll down memory lane turned into a stand-up routine that had the entire audience rolling in its seats. Food was provided for the benefactors and political figures such as the mayor of North Miami were present.

Barry entertained guests with his usual wit in the VIP presentation at the WUC ballrooms. 

Professor Leonard Kaufman taught at the FIU industrial engineering department for seven years from 1995-2001.

He was born and raised in Cuba, a graduate of University of Illinois. He also earned a master in business administration from FIU in 1987.

"Leonard Kaufman visited BBC many times, though we never had the money to pay him," said Raul Moncarz, recently retired vice-provost and the evening's master of ceremonies.

"But his love was the students and the students loved him. That is why this is a night for the students."

The event is held as a memorial lecture to raise funds towards the Leonard Kaufman Memorial scholarship; however, this was the first year it was held at Biscayne Bay Campus.

Leonard Kaufman's family began the scholarship to honor the love he had for teaching and his willingness to help students succeed.  According to his daughter, Michelle Kaufman, it was only appropriate.

"My family started the scholarship because we figured this is a way that his legacy can live on and he can continue to help FIU students for years and years," Michelle Kaufman told The Beacon via email.

Professor Shih-Ming Lee, chairman and associate professor of the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, acknowledged Kaufman's persistent dedication.

"He always offered his services and served on our industrial advisory board," Lee said. 

"He would ask at every meeting, 'Can I help?' or 'Is there anything I can do?' He continued asking and than started teaching ten years ago in quality management, he enjoyed it so much he requested another class."

Michelle Kaufman, who works as a sportswriter for The Miami Herald, confided that one of her favorite memories of her father were watching him graduate from FIU with his masters in 1987.

"I have vivid memories of him studying for his master's degree late at night, after getting home from a full day of work in factories because he wanted to teach," she told The Beacon. 

"It turned out that I got my bachelor's degree in journalism from UM in May 1987... So, we both graduated within days of each other, which was very emotional for me. Watching him walk down the aisle at FIU graduation, knowing he could now teach was a great moment."

Rob Barry, Dave Barry's son, found the night an ideal way to remember his stepmother's father.

"He was really quirky," Rob Barry said. "He was obsessed with Peru and found anything involved with it hilarious. I also remember sitting down at the dinner table and him explaining engineering to me when I was like 14."

Celita Kaufman, Leonard Kaufman's wife and the rest of the family lined the second row to enjoy Dave Barry do what he does best: entertain.

"Everything is funny, people react to scary thing by laughing so what better way deal with bad things then by laughing," Dave Barry said.

Headline: Talks on new cafeteria continue
Author: Jose Maya / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Proposals for the current cafeteria's future and the goal to open a new cafeteria next summer are still underway, but without any concrete decisions.

Members of the Biscayne Bay Campus' Student Government Council  met with Rosa Jones, vice-president of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education, and Assistant Vice-President Cathy Akens to review these issues Oct. 7.

 Jones's main concern was the new cafeteria's food choices. 

"It's possible to talk about the combination of an all-you-can-eat buffet and a cafeteria," she said.

Akens, on the other hand, addressed the potential profit possibilities the expansion will hold for the students and the University.

"It is a business deal that has a profit margin for the University; now it's the time to have the input on what services will be provided," Akens said.  

This input would affect the need to expand and accommodate BBC's current 278 housing students as well as the overall student body growth.

Questions regarding the food services were directed to Felicia Townsend, director of business services.

However, according to Jones student should address their questions to the SGC-BBC.

Brent Maximin, director of student lobbying, asked the question on most students' minds: What will happen to the current cafeteria space?

"It is important that dialogue in relation to space has begun only this semester. I have compiled a list and student services is one of my priorities," Jones said.

Maximin agrees this should be at the top of the list.

"We should focus on expanding student services instead of trying to cut corners, and at this point should we put academic space higher than health center" Maximin said. 

Jones assured that the Health and Wellness Center, currently located in a trailer near the BBC Library, will be brought in along with the expansion of the cafeteria. 

The exact location is still unknown.

Ideas such as a game room, office space for students and staff, a salon, a bowling alley and a dry cleaning service were also thrown around as possibilities to open up to students. 

"We can set up a multi-purpose room that can be set up for classes and other activities," Jones said.  

"We are growing as Biscayne Bay grows, we are in need of more elbow room," said Pamela St. Fleur, SGC-BBC vice-president.

Discussion touched on possible bookstore and credit union expansions, but Jones reminded student council members that those are auxiliaries to the school.

She also stated that they needed to come up with a marketing plan before any major decision would be taken. 

"We shouldn't centralize all food services on the first floor only. We should create another space for a snack for students who don't have time to go up and down," said SGC-BBC Comptroller Zach Trautenberg.

As for space needed for other campus services, The Beacon's office at WUC 124 was also mentioned.

"Why not cut The Beacon's office to create more space. There's usually only one or two people in there," Trautenberg said.

But Silva reiterated that his main concern is space for student services members and brought up the question of Panther Print. 

"If they are not serving the students, they should move out," Silva said. 

SGC-BBC is welcoming suggestions from students in regards to future food vendors and will meet in a month with Jones to discuss further proposals.

Headline: Pit Bull: Hometown rapper discusses upcoming album, collaborations
Author: Hikmat Kilzi / WRGP Staff
&nbsp;
Miami-based rapper Pitbull - who recently performed at FIU -  sat down during WRGP's the "Itz All Gravy Show" to discuss his recent collaborations and upcoming album, El Mariel.

 Q: You've got this El Mariel album dropping soon. I know you're really excited about it. The anticipation is crazy. 

 Fa sho! El Mariel album, that's going to be out [Oct. 31] and all the fans out there see that the date keeps getting pushed back got to understand what I'm cooking up for them right now is some left field (pause). You know? What really nobody is doing right now.

 Q: What's behind the title of the album, El Mariel?

Basically, the album is entertaining, of course, with the music. But somehow, some way the title is educating. It'll educate folks on a little bit of history, on our [Cuban] culture. And to me, it's my boatlift. 2006 is my Mariel. They let me in the game and I'm here to take advantage of these opportunities.

 Q: I know you went gold with the last album and you're trying to go platinum with this one.

 It's been 2 years since I dropped the last album M.I.A.M.I. It went gold and that's a blessing. I got the [M.I. Still A.M.I album] out there - that's at 300,000 copies.

With El Mariel, we're definitely trying to go platinum, it's a slow grind, but a fa' sho' grind. That's really the way I look at it.

 Q: What's on the album that's going to give it that push to platinum?

I got a lot of different types of music, but a lot of energy on the album. You got Jim Johnson producing, you got Diaz Bros., Lil' Jon, Mr. Collipark. I got Toomp working on there, too, so there is a lot of different types of music. You got your street records, your club records, your deep records. It's just a variety of music. It ain't just one style. You know Pitbull. 

First of all, I'm diverse when it comes to that. I try to give people all different types of music.

Q: I've seen you grow, Pit; you've been in and out of the studio with me over the past few years and I know you've learned a lot of things as an artist. What do you think you've learned from the last albums to this album that you'll apply to your marketing strategies this time around?

I've been around the country, been around the world, and I see what markets I can basically target and really milk the album.

My biggest markets are the biggest states of America. You got Texas, Los Angeles and Florida, New York, Chicago. I make sure my plans in those markets are A+.

 Q: You make dance music and club music to appeal to the masses, but what kind of music would you do more of if you could?

I wish I could always do [something like] a song on my album called "Rain Drops."

Once you all hear that, it's a different side of Pitbull. That's really what I want to do, but like anything in life you have to cater in order to be catered to. Little by little, dawg, you give them what they want to hear and then you give them what you want them to hear.

Q: Who would you like to work with that you haven't had a chance to work with yet?

I'll just work with anyone who wants to work with me.

The only person I didn't get a chance to work with that I wanted to work with was Celia Cruz. Maybe I can make a record with one of her samples.

 Q: I know you're very passionate when you talk about Cuba. What do you think is really going on with this whole Castro situation? What would you like to see happen with Cuba?

For Cuba, the bottom line is, you know I would like it to be free. 

As far as the Castro thing, I think it's all smoke and mirrors. I think Castro is dead and they're just trying to find a way to cover it up and line it up so they can get ready for what's about to happen. 

Hopefully, the island will open up with God's help.



Pitbull's album, El Mariel, will be released in October. Anyone interested in finding out more about the rapper and his work can visit www.myspace.com/pitbull and pitbullmusic.com.Hikmat Kilzi

Headline: Marching band promotes school spirit at home games
Author: Cristina Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
You can see them standing on the sidelines at FIU home football games. Some of the members are in groups chatting away. Others members are playing games that they have just made up on the spot. 

They call themselves "The Band of the Sun," named for Florida's reputation as the Sunshine State. 

To show off this influence, the band's uniforms, flags and music all incorporate Hispanic culture and the art deco history of South Florida.

But designing the uniforms, creating the flags and composing the music were all among the last steps that Mark Gregory Martin, the band's director, took to assemble the FIU Marching Band in 2001.

Martin spent the first year recruiting at high school football games throughout the Miami-Dade and Broward areas; he set up booths at state marching band competitions and got the University's name out there by using recruiting materials and visits as a means of finding potential players. 

He also did extensive research in finding the best prices for the band's instrument purchase.

 "Many people do not realize how expensive it is to start a collegiate marching band," Martin said, "but due to the diligent research of [former vice president of student affairs Patricia] Telles-Irvin, she gave me ample funding to purchase everything necessary."

With 25 years of experience as an assistant director of the Long Horn Band at the University of Texas-Austin and a lecturer at James Madison University (from which he holds a master of musical arts degree in wind conducting), Martin uses the marching band showmanship and wind conducting teaching methods when directing.

 "As I tell the students all the time, there is very little that is original with our band … the tried and true methods that I know work and work well," Martin said.

The band rehearses three times a week, two hours at a time, and additional practices are squeezed into the band members' busy schedules.  

"Everyone has trouble balancing school and work, but add a huge thing like a marching band, and it takes one phrase to describe: 'Time Management,'" said Alisa Feliciano, a lead horn player in the band.

"We learn a new show every home game, which can be very difficult if we lose any time due to weather," said Andres Gonzalez, the band's field commander. 

The band learned a new show for the Sept. 30 home football game against Arkansas State, during which "The Band of the Sun" played Latin-based music in honor of Hispanic Heritage month. 

That same day, the group hosted a "band day" at FIU, in which participating bands performed and received taped comments from evaluators, followed by a 30-minute on-field clinic. 

Unlike a high school band's serious involvement in the competition circuit, a college band puts all of its energy into entertainment and bringing school spirit to the university, Gonzalez said.

Despite its small size, the Band of the Sun has already gained both national and international recognition. 

During the band's first year, it performed on the nationally televised Thanksgiving Day parade. 

Recently, the band has been invited to perform in Ireland at the St. Patrick's Day parade and the Fourth of July parade in Washington D.C. 

"I'm really looking forward to performing at the band competitions this year," Gonzalez said. "Those kids really show their appreciation and support like no football crowd can."

Headline: Review: Alice in Chains (Concert)
Author: Jason Geller / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If one practices hard enough, they can perfect any guitar solo or duplicate any drum beat, but to capture the soul of a fallen frontman is the greatest challenge of all. 

A frontman's movements on stage, his interaction with the crowd and the passion in his voice sets the pace of the entire band.

When Layne Staley passed away in April of 2002, Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell faced this impossible task.

 Staley had the ultimate gift of stretching a note to a surreal length and then changing its tone instantaneously.

Just when you thought Staley could carry the note no further, he would let out the most spine-tingling wail, not heard since Ozzy Osbourne's heyday.

Staley's voice allowed Cantrell to explore new layers of light and shade, which granted the band access to limitless dimensions. His heroin addiction set the tone for the band's dark lyrics and mood.  Losing Layne seemed like the end for Alice in Chains.

But seeing Alice in Chains at Revolution on Oct. 12 was like finding a new love.

In addressing the crowd, William DuVall, frontman for Comes With The Fall, sounds nothing like Staley, but if you close your eyes and listen to DuVall sing, you can feel the soul of Staley passing through you.

Cantrell sounded as sharp with the band's heavier albums, Dirt and Facelift, as he did with Alice in Chains and Jar of Flies, the only EP to ever debut at #1.  A speed-metal solo can be learned with time, but to move through the melodic structure of an Alice in Chains composition proves much more difficult.

Bassist Mike Inez, who's been with the band since 1993, and founding drummer Sean Kinney provided the dark rhythm section as the band dipped through most of their back-catalog.

Revolution's intimate setting and dark lighting set the perfect mood for Alice in Chains.

The band performed outside, against a mountain-like backdrop with red curtains adorning the stage. The crowd of mostly 25 to 40-year-olds had the option of standing in the lower open-air crowd or on a balcony.

Alice in Chains began with "Bleed the Freak," and "It Ain't Like That" from Facelift. The band then stepped heavily into Dirt, the album that brought them mainstream success, with "Junkhead," "Them Bones," "Damn That River" and "Rain When I Die."

Alice in Chains ended their set with "We Die Young," "Down in a Whole," and the radio staple "Man in the Box." They were immediately called back for an encore, which meant that after almost a decade-long performing hiatus, there was more to the group than the harmonies still floating in the air.

Headline: Review: Okami (Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As we move toward the next generation of gaming systems, it's amazing that there is still life in our current consoles. Sure, we have the X-Box 360 along with Sony's PS3 and the anticipation of the release of Nintendo's Wii, but that hasn't stopped developers like Capcom's Clover Studio from gracing PS2 owners with Okami.

The story is steeped in Japanese mythology of the god Amaterasu, awakening as a wolf after a 100-year slumber; then game then follows his fight with the eight-headed beast, Orochi, to restore peace to the world.

Finding the world covered in darkness, Amaterasu sets forth to gain back his godly powers to restore life to the world. While many games that go through translation and other changes suffer, Okami sticks to its Japanese roots with its style and storytelling.  Much of the kanji (Japanese script) used throughout the game remained intact, for example. For those interested, the instruction manual does provide a brief explanation on the myths that the story is based on.

  The game's presentation is nothing short of breathtaking. Using a unique method of cel shading and water coloring, Okami literally paints a living, mystical world onscreen. And to that, the game allows you to aid in the painting. Early in the game, you gain access to the Celestial Brush, a very important tool in your quest. With this brush, you can manipulate the very environment with mere strokes. Want to turn night into day?  Just paint a circle in the sky and watch the sun emerge. Need to cross a bridge that's down?  Just fill in the gap by painting it with the brush. 

Controls are simple enough to grasp. Early in the game, your moves are limited but with progress, you will gain additional weapons and even powers of the Celestial Brush (like slashing through enemies by painting a straight line).

Outside of combat, you can journey throughout the land finding all forms of life, human or animal, in need of your help. The game itself is as vast as its world and while it is not too hard for the most part, the game is extensive. The amounts of cutscenes used in the game also contribute to the game's length.

While presenting a unique approach to art and style, Okami delivers solid gameplay that's unique, captivating and easy to grasp. In the midst of a trend of blasé effort, it's nice to see that there are developers willing to take risks in presenting something unusual that is accessible and captivating to anyone willing to look.

Headline: Rainy day inspires SGA campaign
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Rocio Perez, speaker of the house for the Student Government Council at University Park, was driving past a dollar store one rainy afternoon this summer when, on a whim, she went in and bought 17 big, blue umbrellas. 

She gave one to each member of the council with a specific set of instructions. They were to each find one person who was stuck in the rain and hand them their umbrella, saying only, "SGA cares about you."

The umbrella project, as Perez and her fellow representatives call it, was not an isolated event, but rather part of SGA Cares, the SGC-UP House of Representatives' program for improving student government this year.

Asked to define SGA Cares, representatives could not agree on what to call it. "It's a campaign," said Representative-at-Large Marbely Hernandez. 

However, Perez called it a vision, not a campaign.  

Others referred to it as a program. 

Though the representatives' description of SGA Cares differed, everyone agreed that it comprises three specific goals the House plans to fulfill over the course of this school year: to take SGA to the students, to implement dynamic and positive change, and to build bridges between student government, administration, faculty and on-campus organizations.

The centerpiece for the House's initiative to take SGA to the students is a series of forums, including one for every college, in which students can voice their concerns to faculty and administrators.

The first of these forums was held Oct. 16 in GC 140 for the College of Arts and Sciences. 

Representatives-at-Large Arthur "A.J." Meyer, Jennifer Ruiz and Hernandez and Lower Division Representatives Paige LaPointe and Tomas Martinelli are organizing the next forum, which will allow students to voice general concerns about campus life. 

"Students can come and find out more and ask questions about academics, about what Health Services has to offer them, about stuff going on with athletics, about campus security," Hernandez said.

Possible administrative attendees include representatives from the Department of Parking and Transportation, FIU University Health Services, Academic Affairs, Athletics, Housing & Residential Life and the FIU Police Department. According to Hernandez, the forum will most likely take place in November, though a date has not been set.

Students can also expect forums for the Honors College and the College of Health and Urban Affairs in the near future, possibly before the end of the Fall semester.

Asked to describe SGA Cares's second goal, - dynamic and positive change - Perez said, "Sometimes reps have good ideas, but they aren't put into action."

This is sometimes for lack of organization or simply because representatives don't know what practical steps to take in implementing their ideas, according to Perez.

Perez and Meyer, as speaker of the house and speaker pro-tempore, respectively, have addressed this by inviting representatives to have one-on-one conversations with them at least twice a semester.  Representatives can inform Meyer and Perez on their progress throughout the semester, report any problems they have encountered and receive advice on how to address them.

"Speaking from my experience, having been a lower-division rep, you get kind of nervous when you start out as a representative. You don't know what you can or can't do. We want to break down the barrier of having to stand up and speak in front of the entire House, which might keep some reps from having an opportunity to speak to us," Meyer said. 

In its first step toward developing SGA Cares' third goal, the House held a professor's luncheon Oct. 18. Each representative was encouraged to invite five to 10 faculty members to the luncheon, and representatives had a chance to sit down and establish a rapport with faculty maembers. 

"That luncheon was a nail in the first two-by-four on that bridge. It was the first step so that they can understand us and we can understand them," Meyer said.

Headline: Groundskeepers keep the grass greener on FIU's side
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While walking across campus, the sight of a groundskeeper mowing the grass or trimming a hedge may be a common one. 

One of these groundskeepers is John Goldwire, who has worked at FIU for two years and two months, and currently is a supervisor for some of the other groundskeepers.

"I love my job, and I have good employees," Goldwire said.

Between 16 and 22 groundskeepers report to FIU and trek across University Park in the hot sun in order to keep the campus looking nice and orderly.

The groundskeepers perform landscape maintenance duties such as cutting grass and trimming hedges on both FIU campuses as well as the College of Engineering on Flagler.

"It's the type of work I like to do," said Kilo Towner, who has been working as a groundskeeper at FIU for a month and a half.

According to Mark J. Salemi, superintended of Landscape, Grounds Maintenance and Athletic Grounds, UP covers about 341 square acres, the Biscayne Bay Campus covers about 200 square acres and the College of Engineering is about 36 square acres.

Typically, Goldwire and the groundskeepers under his supervision cover a quarter of the UP campus in a day.

"To me, it's fun," Goldwire said.  "You're outdoors, out in the sun, and I have great bosses."

While Goldwire supervises the work out in the field, Salemi operates on the office side keeping everything together and managing contracts.

The groundskeepers are contracted to FIU from Aramark Services, and Salemi is in charge of managing Aramark's contract.

"Aramark handles the landscaping and ground maintenance side," Salemi said referring to the mowing, weeding and fertilizing required to maintain the campuses landscape. 

"They report to me and that's where more than half the bulk of my work comes from," he said. 

Groundskeepers work from Monday to Friday from 5 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. with the exception of Goldwire.

As a supervisor Goldwire works until 5 p.m., seven days a week.

Goldwire, however, does not mind the hours.

"It keeps me busy," he said.

When asked why the groundskeepers had to get such an early start, "[Because] there's mucho grass," Goldwire replied with a laugh.

Some of the groundskeepers have some experience in similar lines of work.

Towner had previously worked as a groundskeeper but not at a scale as large as a college campus.

Before working at FIU, Goldwire had his own lawn service business but changed jobs.

Others, like Ricardo Vargas, who has been an FIU groundskeeper for about three months, used to work on detailing and washing cars at a Mazda dealership.

Vargas heard about the groundskeeping job from a friend who had previously worked at FIU.

"It's not really that hard," Vargas said.  "You've got two or three people pretty much doing the same thing, so it's easy when you've got something to do."

As for the way tasks are assigned out in the field, supervisors such as Goldwire decide who works on what area.

"We have equipment, basically, but we'll talk to our supervisor [Goldwire], and he'll let us know what he wants us to do," Vargas said.  "Usually, you do the same thing you've been doing all along."

Despite spending the day out in the sun, Miami's hot temperature doesn't bother the groundskeepers.

"I'm used to it," Towner said, a native of Miami.

Vargas, another Miami native, agreed.

"I've been living in Miami all my life, so I'm used to the heat by now," Vargas said.

"I love the heat," Goldwire said.  "Now, when it comes to winter, I might have a problem."

Although Aramark's regulations do not allow the groundskeepers to socialize with students beyond a polite greeting, Goldwire has had the opportunity to meet up with some of FIU's other residents - namely, the foxes that live on campus.

"There's about two or three of them in the woods," Goldwire said.  "We don't have names for them.  We just call them 'Fox.'"

Headline: Cuban artist performs at UP
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Visual artist Juan-Sí Gonz&aacute;lez will explore both the use of fear as a political instrument and the fear which results from ignorance in a one-night interactive performance at FIU's Frost Art Museum Oct. 25 at 7 p.m.

The Frost Art Museum, The Cuban Research Institute and the School of Art and Art History worked together to have this one-night performance by Gonz&aacute;lez, which will consist of a politically and socially charged installation called "Patriotic Games and the Domino Effect."

"With this performance, I want to draw attention to how our public space, our shared mental landscape, has become fertile ground for indiscriminate marketing," Gonz&aacute;lez said in a statement to the Frost Art Museum. "The lines have been blurred between advertising and political propaganda … I want to reflect on the repercussions that this has and will continue to have on our emotional and psychic consciousness."

Gonz&aacute;lez's installation will consist of a giant black box outside the museum through which he will direct its spectators, making it an interactive performance. Following the performance, Gonz&aacute;lez will talk about the installation and the issues raised by it, hoping to provoke and spark a politically charged debate. However, what exactly will be inside the box is a surprise. 

"It makes an allusion to the black box in an airplane that records all that occurs. It also suggests a darkroom where images that are captured by another black box - the camera - are revealed. And it makes an allusion to Mecca, which in the West today is often associated with a fanatical, fundamentalist Islam. Recontextualized within our reality and filled with photographic evidence of our daily surroundings, the black box represents another type of fanatical fundamentalism - our own," Gonz&aacute;lez said.

Cuban born Gonz&aacute;lez studied at the Higher Institute of Arts in Cuba and worked with many Cuban organizations, including the Ministry of Culture. In the early '80s, he began to challenge the parameters of what was accepted as art from an institutional standpoint. 

He worked with other visual artists using street performances to eliminate the role of art institutions as intermediary. However, his political views against the government soon limited his work to underground performances until he felt to Costa Rica in 1989.

After having exhibitions through Europe, the United States and Latin America, Gonz&aacute;lez finally settled in Ohio, where he teaches Latin American literature and works as a freelance photographer.

"Gonz&aacute;lez has always been involved in politics. Now that he is in the United States, his new home, he is constantly questioning American politics through his visual performances," said Caroline Paker, the museum's curator of education.  

"I was struck by how much the political and religious advertising that was beginning to crop up here resembled the political propaganda that I grew up with in Cuba," Gonz&aacute;lez said. "The difference is that in Cuba the propaganda is designed and propagated by the government, whereas here it is primarily designed and promulgated by private enterprise and then consumed and further disseminated by individuals."

Gonz&aacute;lez will perform at FIU as part of the Frost Art Museum's "Wednesday After Hours" and the Cuban Research Institute's "Culture at the Edge" series. Although he will perform for only one night, he will be visiting art and art history classes during the two days before the event. 

"As a pivotal figure of an important art movement in the '80s in Cuba, Juan-Sí addresses social and political issues that will be of interest to the South Florida community.  This event will be an opportunity for him to reconnect to a generation of artists that reside in Miami, allowing for renewed relationships to be formed," said Elizabeth Cerejido, the museum's curator, in a press release.  

"Patriotic Games and the Domino Effect" will be held Oct. 25 at 7 p.m.; it is free and open to the public.

Headline: Maidique discusses China campus
Author: C. Joel Marino and Betsy Martinez / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
(This is the last part of a four part series in which The Beacon interviewed University President Modesto A. Maidique to commemorate his 20th anniversary at FIU.)

Q: What progress has been made at FIU's School of Hospitality campus in Tianjin, China?

With the China deal, two years ago, I was there to place the cornerstone; they said that in two years, the campus would be done. I said it couldn't happen, but now two years later, almost to the day, I was back there, the campus is built, there are some students [from China] there, and the program is going.

 

Q: When is the first class expected to begin?

In two years. They try to get two years at the Tianjin University of Commerce, then transitioning to us.

I expect to be there again to see this in two years.



Q: Will FIU students be able to take classes at this campus?

Yup, we expect some FIU students to go to China.

China is the next big thing in the world, and we also expect Chinese students to come here.

Board of Trustees receive apology from University President Modesto A. Maidique

University President Modesto A. Maidique apologized to the Board of Trustees for the brawl between University of Miami and FIU football players Oct. 14 at an emergency meeting Oct. 20.

Via conference call, he updated BOT members on the events that took place in the game and subsequent action taken by the University.

Maidique explained to the members that the University increased the punishment the Sun Belt Conference had originally handed down, which was initially a one game suspension. In all, 16 players were suspended indefinitely and two players were dismissed form the team. However, the players who were dismissed will retain their academic scholarships.

New athletic director Pete Garcia also briefed the BOT on further action being taken by the athletic department, including anger management for all members of the football team and community service for the team and the coaching staff.

BOT members in general were satisfied with the actions taken by the University.

Nursing representative at BBC disagrees with SGC president's comment

During a Student Government Association University-wide Council meeting Oct. 13, SGC-BBC President Camilo Silva said that there is no need for the nursing representative position because there are no nursing majors at BBC.

Paula Delpech, nursing representative at the Biscayne Bay Campus, disagrees.

"We've been offering classes at BBC since fall 2005 and became permanent in August 2006. Within the nursing program we have the foreign physician nursing program at BBC," Delpech said.

The foreign physician nursing program has 105 students currently admitted and plans to admit another 48 students in the Spring of 2007.

According to Delpech, courses in the program are offered in the evening while clinicals (internships for nurses) are scheduled during the weekend in different hospitals.

Delpech said she would be contacting Silva regarding his comment.

"I just need to correct the statement," Delpech said.

Headline: Sifting Through The Stupid
Subheadline: Rapture, Repent and Reload: A new breed of Christian media is demanding that players kill, convert or be 'left behind'
Author: Shawn M. Sprocket / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In recent years, we've watched more and more Christian entertainment flood into the mainstream market.

Crossover music bands like Relient K and Underoath have found success in both secular and Christian industries. The Passion of the Christ generated more than $500 million through controversy and has made Mel Gibson famous all over again.

Last winter, The Chronicles of Narnia with its heavy Christian undertones swept bookstores, theatres, gift stores and fast food chains.

But one of the last remaining sectors of popular entertainment remains untapped: the $10 billion gaming industry. Have no fear, Left Behind Games (an affiliate of the popular Christian book series) is preparing for the launch of the first "high-quality" video game with "inspirational content."

In Left Behind: Eternal Forces, gamers play as persecuted Christians in the near future who've been left behind after God swept up true believers in an instantaneous rapture. They face a world where the Antichrist sets his global forces against Christians and seeks to eradicate them with his one-world government.

As a character in the game, you must convert strangers through prayer or kill them with weapons like tanks and guns. While the game has no blood or excessive gore, killing and destroying are clearly central to gameplay.

Many atheist skeptics would like to generalize and point to the game as a fanatical crusade against non-believers, but it's important to note that some Christians are not happy with the game, either.

Many believers are disturbed by the game, as it confuses Christian messages of 'love thy neighbor' with Grand Theft Auto chaos.

The part that has Christians really furious is that cheat codes to be released with the game will allow players to play as the Antichrist, where they can destroy Christians with all the same weapons.

Left Behind Games says it expects an "E for Everyone" rating and compares the game's wholesome fun to chess, but many parents aren't convinced.

The Gallup Poll reported last year that a majority of Americans view the media's influence on their children as 'extremely important' in determining whether they commit violent acts or not. 

So if a kid's favorite video game says it's okay to 'shoot thy neighbor,' then how can we expect them to act?

If God is love, then why are spirit-filled Christians arming against people in the streets?

LB:EF is an attempt to bring Christianity to the mainstream market, which doesn't necessarily bother me. I have many friends and family members who are happy with their faith and enjoy Christian media.

But at what point does 'fitting in' cross over lines that contradict the core message of the faith?

Gamers won't go to church because they played LB:EF. They won't believe in God because they got to shoot at the Antichrist. They probably won't read the Bible just because it came free with the game (yes, you heard me: a Bible comes free with the game). 

The game's developers have stressed that the game upholds positive morals and Christian values, but to be honest, I just don't see it.

Doesn't the Bible say to 'turn the other cheek'? Isn't this violent game just a sad attempt for Christians to find acceptance in secular entertainment? Christian game developers are stooping to the lowest level to be seen as 'cool'. Even Peter Brady learned this lesson: in the end you have to be yourself.

Left Behind: Eternal Forces will be released  November 7th.

Headline: LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Banning of trans fats would help curb heart disease epidemic
Author: Paul Benavides / Sophomore / Psychology Major
&nbsp;
I was shocked when reading Jose de Wit's article "Trans fats sans government" (Oct. 16) because of its peculiar argument that the recent regulation on trans fats is the result of when "local governments feel they must step into their constituents' private lives and micro-manage their eating habits for them."

However, this reason is far from the actual public statements made by New York City and its health commissioner. 

Their proposal to phase out artificial trans fat is based on medical findings that hydrogenated oils are toxic.

The health commissioner said: "Like lead in paint, artificial trans fat in food is invisible and dangerous, and it can be replaced."

Walter Willmett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard, said: "Trans fat from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is a toxic substance that does not belong in food."

These findings are cause for concern, not an attack on personal freedoms.

Coronary heart disease is a grave health problem in the U.S., whose financial and social costs are beyond imagination. The phase-out of trans fats is a natural response.

De Wit says: "When the FDA suggested in 2002 that it might consider mandatory labeling of trans fat content in foods, restaurants around the country made the switch from trans fats to healthier oils." This is an inaccurate statement.

First, the FDA suggestion for labeling became mandatory in 2003 because of concerned awareness that followed a Kraft lawsuit. Food companies don't easily budge.

Before New York City proposed its trans fat phase-out, it conducted a year-long education campaign and survey of its restaurants.

They found that some reduced or stopped using artificial trans fat, but many did not. The results of that survey alarmed city officials and made them decide to begin the phase-out. 

I doubt any of these events points to deliberate impingement on personal liberties.

Headline: Setter assists her team on and off the court
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Most of Keila Oliveira's volleyball teammates can describe the junior setter in one word: inspirational.

"She's a player that every coach wishes to have once in their career. She works hard every practice and expects her teammates to work as hard as she does and that has been a huge change for our team," said coach Danijela Tomic.

Following her success at Miami-Dade College, where her team compiled a 66-1 record in a two-year span, Oliveira chose to transfer to FIU.

While on the team, Oliveira propelled the FIU Women's Volleyball team to a 16-6 record and changed the chemistry of the FIU Women's Volleyball team in her first year at FIU.

"She came to the team when we really started being a team," said outside hitter Olga Verun.

Oliveira plays the setter position, which is the playmaker on the team. She acts according to how the opposing team is defending and she exploits their weaknesses using her teammates.

"As setter, I am the brain of the team," Oliveira said. "I have to analyze the block and play against the block with my best players. I organize the plays we do."

In Brazil, her native country, Oliveira played as an outside hitter and enjoyed it very much. Outside hitters score the majority of points. While at FIU, Oliveira never demanded to be an outside hitter.

She recognized that the team's best chance of winning is having her play as the setter.

Oliveira is also known for the inspiration she gives her teammates.

"One thing I told them was, first of all, believe that we can play, that we have the potential and we have the talent to be winners," Oliveira said.

Freshman outside hitter and fellow Sun Belt Conference player of the week, Yarimar Rosa, was out with an injury and couldn't play in matches against North Texas and Denver Oct. 6 and Oct. 8, respectively.

Oliveira did not panic over the loss of her teammate; instead, she responded with her best week as a  Golden Panther.

"I didn't think about [Rosa's absence]. I was just trying to show them how much I trust them," Oliveira said.

Oliveira is convinced all players on the team have contributed.

"Volleyball is a team game and we need each other," Oliveira said.

The setter began playing team volleyball in Brazil at the age of nine. She is the most experienced player on the team, which makes her a mentor younger players look to for advice. Her veteran presence is crucial since five of the 12 players are freshmen.

"She is very mature. She gives us younger players advice during the good times and the bad times. She always supports us," Rosa said.

Oliveira's willingness to guide people through tough times is not only an attitude she reflects as a player, but also as a person. 

"I'm helping other people on the court and outside the court. My major is physical therapy. I like physical therapy because I like to help. I like to find problems to fix," Oliveira said.

Given her mind-set off the court, it is only fitting that Keila is leading the Sun Belt Conference with an average of 13.52 assists per game in conference play and 12.85 assists per game overall.

According to Oliveira, FIU gives her an opportunity to be an athlete and a student simultaneously.

This is in contrast to Brazil where volleyball is a player's main focus and profession. She still hopes to leave her mark in both fields before leaving FIU.

"I want to help this team win the conference and improve [the volleyball team] at FIU, give my best, maintain my GPA, enter a physical therapy program and get my degree from FIU," Oliveira said.

Headline: Transfer midfielder has no problem translating game
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Dadi Kristj&aacute;nsson has experienced a few Lost in Translation moments since he transferred to FIU from the University of Iceland. Kristj&aacute;nsson speaks English fluently, but Miami's unofficial second language has occasionally made communication difficult.

"It's weird when you're in Publix and ask where something is and then people answer in Spanish," Kristj&aacute;nsson said. "But it's alright. Most people speak English and I can get by."

Kristj&aacute;nsson, 22, hasn't had any problem translating his success on the soccer field. After earning team MVP honors four times as a member of Icelandic club Thor Akureyri, the sophomore midfielder has quickly become a core member of the men's soccer team. His two goals and one assist have all come at critical moments this season. 

Kristj&aacute;nsson, who is majoring in industrial engineering, took some time talk to The Beacon.

Q: How did coach  Karl Kremser recruit you?

I e-mailed some coaches in America when I was interested in coming here. I had friends who were playing for San Diego State and UNC-Greensboro, so I e-mailed him my soccer history and made some videos.

He came to Iceland to watch me play and I scored the winning goal in the last minute of the game, which was good, obviously.

Q: Did knowing teammate Óli Birgisson affect your decision to come to FIU?

Oh, definitely. We wanted to transfer to the same school if we could and we liked FIU as a school and the area. We're taking 15 credits in the engineering department so there's a lot of work and not that much free time, but we're doing good.

Q: So how do classmates respond when you say you're Icelandic?

The most common response is, "Isn't Iceland green and Greenland covered in ice?" Everybody says that. I don't know why; maybe it's something they teach in school.

Q: It's from a movie called... 

Oh, yeah - from The Mighty Ducks. It's funny because some people don't even know what Iceland is. There's a doctor in one of my engineering classes who has a PhD and everything, but he didn't even know.

Q: How does club soccer in Iceland compare to college soccer in America?

It's good. It's at least at the same standards as in America. I played in the first division and teams are [evenly matched], but here it's different from game to game.

Q: Do you want to play professionally when you go back?

I've thought about it but I'm 22. Usually it would have happened already. If the opportunity came, I would take it, but I'm getting my engineering degree and I like playing soccer here.

Q: What's your favorite soccer team? 

My father cheered for [English club] Tottenham Hotspur, so I did, too, because he would have thrown me out otherwise.

I cheer for Barcelona in the Spanish league because I like the way they play and they have Eidur Gudjohnsen. He's one of the best Icelandic players in many, many years so I support him and his club.

Q: What's the most memorable moment in your career?

The most awesome game I've ever played is when Thor won the 17 to 19-year-old Icelandic Cup. It was a 4-4 game that we led but the other team always equalized. We won in the penalty shootout and it was so dramatic.

At FIU, the game against [South Methodist University] was incredible, but it was ruined by the referee. It felt great to score on the penalty kick and take the lead, but if we would have held on to that, it would have been amazing.

Q: That loss and the following loss to Tulsa hurt FIU's chance to win the conference. How can the team rebound?

We have to work together and do better than we did against Tulsa. We didn't go out there to lose and we played bad. I can't really explain what happened that night. But we basically have to win every game if we're going to make it to the NCAA tournament, and I want to go.

Headline: Brawl gives FIU just the publicity it's looking for
Author: Jaimi Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The first ever meeting between cross-town rivals Miami Hurricanes and the Golden Panthers turned out to be much more than anyone ever anticipated, and unfortunately, it wasn't pretty. 

However, the brawl at the Orange Bowl, believe it or not, was a complete and monumental blessing in disguise for FIU and quite possibly it's one of the best things that could have occurred to FIU athletics.

The thug-like brawl that occurred Oct. 14 was without a doubt unfortunate, disgusting and grotesque, not only for the players and coaches involved but for fans, administrators and anyone else involved with either of the universities.

So far, 31 players from both teams have been suspended and more punishment is possible as Larry Coker and Don Strock have acknowledged embarrassment and total discontent after this incident. 

But in all honesty, who were the Golden Panthers before their match with the Hurricanes? They were a young football program that became Division I-A  after only a couple of years and were still in awe of the whole thing like a child when he or she is first taken to Disney World. The team was barely mentioned in the local media and if it was, it was very insignificant while the national media ignored them altogether. 

After the incident, though, everything has changed.

ESPN 2's and ESPN Radio's morning show "Mike and Mike in the Morning" calls this brawl the main story of the weekend. ABC's "Good Morning America" is showing clips of the brawl, "SportsCenter" opens its 90-minute Monday morning edition with this story and The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today prominently covered this football game.

All in all, the name of FIU has been mentioned on national media more times in this past week than it has ever been mentioned in the 34 year history of the institution.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm not applauding what took place during the game, but it happened and we can't change that. That being said, this type of exposure cannot be bought. 

As the old addage says, "There is no such thing as bad publicity."

On an athletic level, that exposure has the most benefits. Before the game, a high school football player in California had no idea FIU even existed; now he does. 

The same principle applies to prospective recruits for all sports. Even though the attention FIU brought is negative, at a subconscious level it doesn't matter. What matters is that the name is out there. 

Local high school prodigies who would have chosen programs like Florida State up in Tallahassee or the University of Florida in Gainesville now might be inclined to stay here because they feel FIU actually matters.

The football program was on a good safe pace to national respectability before this. It was making small and conservative steps in its quest to one day be known nationally.

However, with the constant losing and poor competition in its conference, it was going too slow and progress was halting. The brawl, although unfortunate, accelerated the program's ascension to be known nationally at least 5 years.

When the dust settles and the whole pandemonium has ceased, all that is going to be left is the exposure this event gave FIU.

In fact don't be surprised to see next year's UM-FIU rematch on national television and maybe even in primetime.

Priceless publicity.
