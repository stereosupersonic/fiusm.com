Headline: Spike Lee explores Katrina disaster through documentary
Author: H. Dwight Holmes / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Spike Lee joked he first heard of FIU after the brawl between the University of Miami and FIU's football teams last October.  

The writer, director, actor, producer, author and entrepreneur spoke at the lecture "An Evening with Spike Lee: America through My Lens," held at the Wolfe University Center Ballroom, April 4.

With more than 500 students, faculty and community members from FIU, the University of Miami, Miami-Dade College, and the community at large in attendance, Lee kept the audience laughing in a pensive, but jovial atmosphere.

The lecture was a collaborative effort between the School of Journalism and Mass Communications and the Lectures Committee, which includes members from various student organizations and volunteers. 

     Lee's lecture focused on his third HBO-collaborated effort and most recent documentary, When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts, a film which looks at New Orleans in the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.

The documentary tells the personal stories of those who endured the ordeal and survived to tell the tale of many who lost everything during the storm.

"When Katrina hit, I was in Venice, Italy, glued to the TV switching between CNN and MSNBC," Lee said. 

"When you're overseas, you see things that the American government doesn't want you to see, because the foreign press shows everything, and after five days I decided to do a film about this thing."

According to Lee, the most important thing about the documentary was to give a voice to the neglected people he saw suffering through the hurricane.

The famed director later addressed students in the crowd to choose a career based on what they love, not on what will make them the most money, or make their parents happy.

"Some students succumb to parental pressure and choose something [their parents] want them to do, and in turn the students become miserable," Lee said. 

"Parents kill more dreams than anybody else... so don't let anyone stand in the way of your dreams … I say my prayers every night because I get to do what I love." 

Lee explained that he was a C- student until he figured out what he wanted to do. 

"I wasn't applying myself the first two years of college, and then I decided that film school was the route for me," Lee said.

Lee then completed his film degree, where he is now a professor.  

Lee joked that his father would get on his case when he told him he wanted to be a film-maker, because Lee's father didn't want "a bum for a son."

"Me and your mother did not work three jobs so your skinny black a-- can go wait tables, my father would say," Lee said.

The lecture lasted almost an hour and a half, to a positive response by students in the audience. 

One such student was Atheena Jai, a junior majoring in public relation as well as an aspiring actress said she was moved.

"It was very motivating, and I like that he is giving back by teaching at NYU," said Jai. 

Leon Ellzy, a senior majoring in sociology was proud to have attended.

"He made me proud to be a black man, to be graduating college, and never had a brush with the law at age 26," Ellzy said. 

"He motivated one to follow his/her dreams, and kick all family members and non-progressive elements to the side in order to achieve one's goals."

Headline: SGC candidates discuss plans
Author: Douglas Forte / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Communication and student involvement is the common message from the Biscayne Bay Student Government Council candidates for president and vice president positions. 

Their voices were heard at an open forum held April 5. 

"We have to outreach to students for involvement," said Gabriel Labrador, presidential candidate and current representative-at-large for SGC-BBC. 

The candidates stress that BBC tends to be more of a commuter campus than University Park. 

But, this should not deter students from speaking out and getting involved with school activities and organizations to bring about positive changes.

 "Most students show apathy towards the school and I know because I was apathetic," said an emotional Cassandra Andrade.

Though not a current member of either council, she is running unopposed for the vice president position 

Andrade was also the first to present her platform. She assured students that she embodies what a true leader and student representative is. 

"I have a natural desire to serve. People saw something in me and I care," Andrade said.

According to Andrade, she has run for city commissioner in her hometown and has established a working relationship with current vice president Brent Maximin.

Along with Maximin's help, Andrade will initiate plans to improve food service and operating hours, communication with University Park and FIU Broward Pines Center.

 She also hopes to improve exterior relations and hopefully, transportation.

"I am a commuter student and am always going to and from both campuses, but at the end of the day when I am at [BBC], I have no way of getting food because the dining area is closed and that needs to be changed," Andrade said.

Andrade also wants healthier food options available for students.

"I might want cooked, healthy food after 2 p.m. and it's not possible," she said. 

Andrade believes the fact that is she running unopposed is indicative of the lack of student involvement.

"If there is opposition, that's great because it's student involvement," Andrade said. 

Aside from Labrador, the other candidate for SGC-BBC president is Katiana Saintable, current SGC-BBC representative-at-large. 

Saintable's platform also includes the need for a public lounge, a cleaner environment and, through more student action, feedback and opinions.

Saintable will also plan to present her ideas to the administration.

"We need to build new leadership, so other students will want to be involved," Saintable said.

In contrast to Saintable's focus, Labrador's primary concern is the rise in tuition, which he doesn't believe should be increased. 

He affirms having a working relationships with Greg Olsen, the director of the Wolf University Center, and Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of Student Affairs. 

Labrador also plans to address the lack of housing and limited food options on campus.

His most recent accomplishment was his involvement in the upgrade of the computer lab, which amounted to over $17,000. 

The representative-at-large and lower division representative positions are open, according to Maximin. 

"Once the new council is elected, there will be applications available for these positions," Maximin said.

The council will vote for candidates to fill the positions during the Summer semester, according to Maximin. 

Later, during fall semester, there will be a special election where students will vote to decide whether the elected representatives will keep their positions.

Headline: MEET THE DESTROYER: Indie-pop band packs house at Downtown's Studio A
Subheadline: Review: Of Montreal (Concert)
Author: Reinier Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The cigarette smoke stung my throat and made the air acrid. A sea of hipsters, all wearing their novelty belt buckles and far-too-tight jeans, surrounded me, making the room uncomfortably hot. The DJ had been playing bad electronica all night and the opening act had stepped off the stage nearly an hour ago. My patience was growing thin. But as I was about to lose my spot and sit down, Of Montreal appeared in all of their glittery, flamboyant glory. What followed more than made up for the long wait and eventual sore throat.

Indie-pop band Of Montreal performed at downtown Miami's Studio A on Friday, March 30. In a year, Of Montreal's popularity has risen considerably. Whereas last year, their Miami show drew a few dozen people, this year's performance featured a packed room, with barely any space to move. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem if you could still see and hear the band, but with such high energy music, you can't help but want to dance along. Unfortunately, this wasn't possible due to Studio A literally being a cramped hole in the wall. This is a flaw of the venue and not the band though, so it's forgivable.

Most of the night's songs came from Of Montreal's latest album, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?, and the band opened with their current single, much to the crowd's enjoyment. Nearly every song off the album was played, and even some of the more low key songs were included. Peppered between the new songs were old favorites, including three during their encore performance. The club's sound system was unremarkable, however, with some of the vocals being drowned out by the volume of the instruments and the fans. 

Visually, the band didn't disappoint. A screen behind the band projected artwork and psychedelic visuals the entire night, and band members went through several costume changes, including glittering purple hot pants and fishnet stockings, a bizarre hat complete with faux feathers and a massive gown. One of the night's highlights was a giant lobster claw, a nod to their current music video, where the same prop is used.

The opening act, Swedish indie band Loney, Dear was probably the biggest surprise of the night - their low key style, and the lead singer's unique vocalization were a great lead-in to Of Montreal. Or they would have been if there wasn't an almost hour-long gap between sets. The gap probably had to do with the disappearance of the other opening act, rapper Pigeon John, who was nowhere to be seen.

In the end, the night was enjoyable, despite Studio A trying its hardest to make it otherwise. Their overselling of tickets turned what could have been a perfect evening into simply a great one. 

But if you get a chance to see Of Montreal for yourself, take it - just make sure the venue is big enough for you to scratch your nose.

Headline: Day of Silence to promote tolerance, gay rights
Author: Ben F. Badger, Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The grounds of FIU's University Park will be in silence on April 10, which marks the Day of Silence, an annual event meant to bring awareness to anti-lesbian, gay, bi and transgender behavior such as bullying, harassment and discrimination in schools nationwide. This year, Stonewall Pride Alliance, Multicultural Programs and Services, Residents Hall Association and the Women's Center came together to plan the event.

Student Joseph Quinones knows what it was like to be bullied in middle school and high school simply for being homosexual.  

"It doesn't happen as much now that I'm in college," Quinones said. "[But] I can feel for other students around the country."

During the Day of Silence, individuals pledge not to speak in protest of the silence many LGBT people are forced into. According to Gloria Bauta, the president of Stonewall, 20 people have agreed to participate thus far. 

"FIU has a ginormous LGBT community," Bauta said. "The Day of Silence is tantamount to black history and women's history month."

Those who volunteer to participate will be given speech cards to use throughout the day and black shirts with "Day of Silence" printed on them. The cards will explain why the volunteer is being silent as well as provide a means to communicate with others. 

Volunteers will roam throughout FIU, essentially going through a normal day. Bauta urges volunteers to spend their free time in the Graham Center. 

"Being quiet in the [GC] pit will make a statement," Bauta said.  

For students who wish to participate and have not yet signed up, will have one last chance to do so April 10 at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. in the MPAS conference room. The Day of Silence officially begins at noon. During the two short seminars, volunteers will be given strategies for remaining silent while still getting their message across. 

On display throughout the day will be a public journal. In the journal, volunteers and spectators will be able to write down their thoughts and feelings. This journal will from therein be on display at every FIU Day of Silence until it is filled. 

"I think [April 10] is our biggest event of the year followed by the Coming Out Day," Bauta said. "[The Day of Silence is] crucial." 

According to Bauta, there would be a larger event planned for the national Coming Out Day, but because it takes place in June, the campus would be virtually empty. 

The Day of Silence will culminate with a 6 p.m. parade from the GC pit to the housing quad. Afterwards, there will be the breaking the silence ceremony. At that point, volunteers who pledged to remain silent will be able to speak out about their experience.

Students with questions or concerns about LGBT issues can speak to A.J. Costa, the director of the LGBTQA MPAS office, privately or via e-mail at lgbt@fiu.edu or Bauta at FIU.DOS@gmail.com.

Headline: How To...a humor column: Quarter-life crisis needed for progress
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
When the term "mid-life crisis" comes to mind, typically one thinks of Porsches, Rogaine, secretaries and a certain corresponding pill even Bob Dole endorses. Its symptoms include a fleeting sense of youth and a strong desire to only button your shirt halfway. It's comparable to having an extended anxiety attack and with good reason - coming to the realization that your lifespan is half spent is pretty shocking for the ill-prepared. 

Thankfully, if you're of a certain mindset, you can have a complete freakout even sooner. 

To me, there are two kinds of people who attend FIU: those laid back freshman who generally aren't petrified about the future because they live with their parents, are still learning about themselves, etc; and then the same people just five years later. The same anxiety one feels when nervous about their "life" ending can be similar to how one feels before their "life" begins. 

With that said, do you feel like you're never going to graduate? Does your internship drain your soul? Are you coming to the realization that you're about to embark on a 20 to 30 year journey of routine tasks that will include, but won't be exclusive, to entry-level jobs, paying bills, marriage, kids, divorce and eventually becoming obsolete? If you answered "yes" you may suffer from a quarter-life crisis and be glad the growth is benign.

If you're going through this yourself, don't worry; you were probably always mature for your age. Here's how to cope.



COASTING ON EMPTY 



The quarter-life crisis is unlike the mid-life because while it isn't a desire to go forward, it's not necessarily one to go back either. It's as though you're stuck in neutral with only the power of wind and down-sloping sides of hills to get you to the next gas station.

One way to approach this dilemma is to enjoy it. Face it; this is the only time in your life where society expects you to mess up. Think of how many inane decisions your parents have retold you by qualifying it with "Yeah, but I was in college …" And that's just covers goat stories alone.

Revel in knowing that the limbo period is widening. It's now more common for students to take five years to accomplish a bachelor's degree or go back to school to tackle a master's. Do a backstroke in your pool of apathy. If anything, you'll get some good cardio.



GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN



The absolute truth about youth is that it will fade. If you look at this way, you have no choice but to move forward. The proverbial fire under your butt, once you ignite it, will kick you out of your slump and into action.

So maybe this semester wasn't your semester, and neither was the Fall. Come to think of it, last time you made good grades was pre-Dubya. Nevertheless, your education is one of the only things that are going to ensure you won't be struggling after you break out of this place. Buckle down and get out of school before inflation, real estate and the cost of living gets any higher. The last thing you want is two loan payments - yours and junior's. 



SKIP IT



The common misconception is that growing old means growing up. I plan on going straight from my quarter-life crisis into senility. Aside from deep breathing and acupuncture, there's nothing you can really do except wait for the next crisis to come. Therefore, I think a constant state of senility will keep me grounded - even if it's in 18 pounds of rhubarb preserves. Hey, the cats need to eat too. Good Luck.

Headline: Review: Silence (Theatre)
Author: Angie Esposito / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Theater has taken an interesting - some religious zealous might call it blasphemous -route during this Easter weekend.

The play Silence by Moira Buffini, this production directed by Tracey Moore, deals with many controversial issues both political and personal. 

Taboo topics are touched upon, all with Catholic jargon and beliefs constantly being intertwined. 

On the cusp of what seems to be the first millennium, the story takes place, introducing us to the discrimination of pagans and the need for reconciling with God in order to be saved from the fiery pit of hell. 

The constant religious conversation offers an outside view of Catholicism while poking fun at things such as celibacy and their view of the male genitalia and how it works. 

The characters include: Roger, a priest who deals with his own internal battle with religion; Silence, Lord of Cumbria and a pagan; Ymma, the daughter of a saint who is forced to marry Silence; King Ethelred, who arranges Silence and Ymma's marriage; Eadric, knight to King Ethelred, and Agnes, handmaid to Ymma.

The conflict begins on Silence and Ymma's wedding night, aptly justifying the play's mature audience disclaimer.

As for the performance, I was wowed. The advertisements for the show do it no justice. Walking in, I was expecting a completely dark, heavy and possibly disturbing piece - the kind that leaves you dumbfound and unsure how to react. 

Granted, it was dark and disturbing, but there was also humor amid it, which allows the audience a breather when feeling suffocated by its negativity. 

This is partly done by the actors' timing, with sight gags and puns underlining the intense situation. They were on the mark - even on jokes that went over a majority of the audience's head. 

The set and costumes were accurate for the piece and added to the performance nicely. 

What I'm waiting to see is how they'll transform the dark-age setting it into something suitable for the modern day performance of Proof - the other play which is working together with Silence to act as rotating repertoire.

The highlight of the show had to be B. Leal's portrayal of Silence. 

While everyone else in the cast did a fine job, Leal generally had me convinced at all times of the authenticity of the character Silence. 

And while I don't want to give away anything for those of you who are interested in seeing it, Leal's characterization - for such a small space - was just right.

The tale of Silence alone is incentive to see this play regardless of the plot twists and revelations may shock you. 

Silence and Proof will be playing alternately until April 15. 

For show times and ticket information contact the box office at: (305) 348- 3789.Check out Thursday's issue for the corresponding play, Proof,  review.

Headline: YOU DECIDE: SGA readies for elections, changes
Author: Angelina Troff / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
An uncontested presidential race, an anticipated polling site that never came to fruition and major constitutional changes are some of the larger issues in this year's Student Government elections.

University Park's Student Government presidential candidate Marbely Hernandez is running unopposed with Arthur "AJ" Meyer as her running mate. This is the second consecutive year that a single student runs for president of the Student Government Council at UP.

Last year, current President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon also ran unopposed.

"It was unexpected," Hernandez said. "We just need to get more people involved in SGA."

Candidates must receive a plurality of votes to be elected, but "technically, an uncontested candidate only needs to receive one vote to be elected [to that office]," said Charlie Andrews, director of Campus Life. 

According to Article IV of the SGA constitution ­- which governs the councils at both campuses - any SGC president must hold an elected SGA position "for at least two academic semesters, or 154 days, prior to the first day of official campaigning."

Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs, does not see a direct correlation between the policy as stated in Article IV and the lack of presidential candidates for UP this year. 

"Historically, we have had many individuals who have been interested in running," Jones said.

The SGA constitution also specifies candidates are screened for GPA minimum requirements and "may not be under any academic or disciplinary sanctions." They must also maintain a minimum amount of credits, and attend at least 50 percent of classes at the campus he or she will represent.

Traditionally, election events begin with a candidate's debate.

"The debate was changed to Monday so [students] know it's coming up from kick-off events," said Judene Tulloch, SGC-UP elections commissioner.

All candidates were officially announced at the "Know Your Vote" barbeque event held in Everglades Hall April 4, at 6 p.m. The election will take place April 10 and 11 (Tuesday and Wednesday) from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at various polling sites throughout both campuses.

This time span allows candidates a week to campaign.

Last year, candidates were announced Monday, March 27, at noon with elections held April 4 and 5 (also a Tuesday and a Wednesday). This gave candidates an additional 2 ½ days to campaign.

According to Jose Toscano, SGC-UP advisor, this year's schedule was too short to be as successful as it could be.

Toscano believes that a longer campaign would have increased awareness for the candidates among students.

"I don't mean I want to see flyers all over the campus or half the student body wearing T-shirts. What happens to those students who don't visit [the Graham Center]? Are they affected by SGA? At some point they are, so we need to extend our outreach," he said.

In an effort to increase participation, the council attempted to set up a polling site at the Engineering Center. This would have been the first year students could vote at EC.

"We have the technological resource to run a polling site at EC, but lack of faculty to man the site. This is the same problem we've had for the past two years," Tulloch said.

SGA had also mentioned the possibility of online voting through PantherSoft at a general meeting Jan. 31. However, this system will not be implemented during this year's elections.

"The biggest concern is fraud," Tulloch said. "We may start it next year with all campus-wide elections like Homecoming and General Elections. [Campus Life] wanted to do more testing and have solid ground to go on. There is no way to mimic a general election."

Tulloch also mentioned that SGC-UP members advocated the new technique, but that SGC at the Biscayne Bay Campus was hesitant since they believed the results could not be controlled. Because both campuses need to have a uniform voting system, the online method was not used.

SGC-UP also plans on offering the chance to register for a free round-trip American Airlines ticket to anywhere in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.

"It was a University-wide goal to increase voter turnout. One way we wanted to do this was to offer a voter incentive," Tulloch said. She would like 3,000 students to vote.

Last year, Leon received 1,539 votes, which represented a 50 percent decrease in voter turnout from 2005. A total of 3,158 students voted for both UP presidential candidates.

Traditionally, elections are held the second week after Spring Break, as mandated by the constitution. This year, elections are being held the third week after the break due to a conflict in the election dates and the Campus Life staff's schedule.

Headline: Bobby's World...a column about social issues: Me, Myself and sex identity
Author: Bobby Jo Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A pair of wrinkly palms held a firm grip on my spirit as I heard the incantations of prayer from my grandmothers pale lips-something about Adam and Eve, and how God created man and woman, you know, that wonderful binary.

 Mid-sentence, I stood up and broke away from her aging hands. I had just undermined my grandparents' attempt to pray the gay out of me, assuming you believe in that kind of stuff. 

I don't. When I walked out of that room-for the second time, mind you-I knew that I had to figure out for myself what makes, or who makes a man. Or woman.

It's pretty awkward when your grandparents are praying out your vices. Imagine promising Abuelita and Jesus that you won't have sex until you're married or ever touch alcohol again. Out loud, in front of God, for Christ's sake. 

Now, the only thing more fun than that is the part when they're trying to dig out a premise for prayer, and you already know what it's all about.

"You know that God created man and woman, right?"

Okay, well for argument's sake, sure. I'm following you grandma.

"Do you think you're a woman? Do you like to wear dresses?"

No grandma. Not per se.

"Are you confused?"

Hmm. Tricky question grandma, but I'm a hedonist. I like pleasure. Having sex with a man gives me pleasure. It's not that confusing to me, really. 

But how do you explain that to someone who doesn't see the world the same way you do? How, as a man, do you justify doing something that women do without acquiring a negative or pejorative status? Where do you turn? Who do you quote? Certainly not the great "He."

This is a question that feminists have been asking for decades. This is something even Lil' Kim understands, and asserts vigorously-she can f-k whoever she wants, leave her alone. But now I ask this same question, as a man, to other men. 

Does it not bother anybody that although women have progressed to enjoy traditionally male-dominated spheres of society, men still have a long way to go when it comes to embracing femininity? Why isn't this cause just as important and valid? Why can't a man wear a cute summer dress to his birthday party? Maybe this thought makes you blush, or chuckle. Maybe it reminds you of just another weekend. 

But somehow this dress-wearing man has had his status changed to make him somewhat of a punch line, simply because he chooses to wear a dress.

Although homosexuality was removed from the manual of mental disorders, "gender identity disorder" has curiously found its way in. 

Without getting tangled with the multi-headed hydra of defining what is transexuality/transgendered/intersexed, it is suffice to say that we still are lagging when it comes to accepting the gray that exists in all of us regardless of the rigidity of gender roles we've been taught since play age. Remember? We grew up thinking that only girls can play the mom.

Gender-equality is more than just an issue for women. It's about how we look at people, and what we value. 

Recently in Florida, Steve Stanton was removed from his position as city manager of Largo City because he announced that he would be undergoing sex reassignment surgery. 

In a 5-2 vote, Stanton lost a job simply because of how he chooses to express his gender identity. Should our society value gender norms over how well someone can do their job? 

Sex identity discrimination is just as heinous as racial, ethnic, religious or sexual discrimination. In our own country, individuals are stoned to death and strewn across chain-link faces because of their sex identity. 

When this is the reality we live in, I am persuaded to feel that the right to your own sex identity should be just as protected from discrimination as your right to pray to any deity you like. 

The problem is in how our society constructs what gender means. Such a power system would not be possible unless we had labels for what women are and do, and separate labels for what men are and do. 

This division allowed mankind to justify the enslavement of women throughout most of history, like when women were property, could not vote and did not need to consent to sex. 

Today, we say we want to destroy that system-but we can't unless we learn to take a man in a dress as seriously as a woman in a dress. The enslavement of women as "women" is also the enslavement of men as "men."

This is because everything we do has a gender. Men do this. Women do that. We have thrown everything into two color-coded boxes, and God save the little bit of pink that gets stuck in the blue.

Headline: Violence and corruption still a problem in South Florida
Author: Jose Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the massive influx of individuals from every corner of the world into the confines of Miami-Dade County, there has been an accumulation of wealth and affluence within in a relatively small geographical area. 

Along with this overwhelming immigration of wealthy outsiders, there has been a rampant scourge that has threatened to shatter this equilibrium - this divisive force is none other than crime. 

As the cost of living has ballooned to unprecedented heights, many individuals belonging to the poor and underprivileged classes have taken to criminal endeavors, in an effort to scrape together some means of supporting themselves. 

This is evident in the prevalence of robberies within Miami-Dade County, which boasted 65,011 robberies, burglaries and motor vehicle thefts, combined this year. 

While this rate of crime is remarkably low compared to the crime rate in the 1980's, it is still well above the national average. In fact, the total crime index for the city of Miami was well over twice the national average. 

This stark reality is something that must be addressed with the utmost of haste. An overwhelming majority of the 89 murders, which took place in the city of Miami alone, can be attributed to gang activity. 

There needs to be a more concerted effort on behalf of law authorities to apprehend and identify inner-city gang members. City of Miami Police identified 617 gang members in 2006, and apprehended a mere 113. 

This is inexcusable. These gangs operate primarily to engage in criminal activities. If stringent surveillance were placed on these thugs, many crimes could have been prevented. It is apparent that some sort of outreach and assistance must be given to the inner-city poor to prevent future generations of criminals from springing forth. 

Apart from encroaching on the gang element, there needs to be reform in every level of law enforcement. Stricter screening procedures need to be implemented to select capable officers. 

A profound problem that has plagued both the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County police departments are rampant instances of police corruption and abuse of power. 

A prominent example of this is the 2003 case of eleven City of Miami police officers accused of planting guns at crime scenes, shooting unarmed civilians and giving false statements. 

This is striking evidence that a change in administrative procedures is warranted. This corruption prevents a great deal of progress from being made on the crusade against drug trade. 

There is little doubt that a greater police presence in the city and elsewhere is necessary. It needs to be coupled with reform on the administrative level, not only to maximize the efficiency of our local law enforcement, but also to make Miami a safer place to live in.

Headline: SWING AND A MISS: Hurricanes walk away with baseball victory
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
There was no fight or bench-clearing brawl and there definitely were no helmets or crutches used as weapons April 4 at Mark Light Field. 

However, there was an extra-inning thriller, which included hit batsmen, blown leads and a 10-9 extra innings loss for the baseball team (16-16) to the University of Miami (18-13).

"I told [the pitchers] you just need to go after them," coach Danny Price said. "They're a good club, but I told them it's our stuff versus their stuff."

The Hurricanes made it a priority to tap into the Golden Panthers' bullpen, which has suffered from inconsistency and instability all season. 

Starting pitcher Ryan Bernal (3-0) was ousted after allowing three runs in a mere two innings.

"We used a lot of our pitchers this past weekend, so we knew we were going to be in a bad situation," senior catcher Luis Bautista said.

An error by right fielder Raimy Fuentes and an RBI single by first basemen Yonder Alonso, who went 3-for-4 with three RBI, gave the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead in the first inning. 

The Hurricanes tacked on two runs in the following inning. In Bernal's two innings of work, he threw a total 58 pitches, which prompted Price to bring in reliever Brian Santana to stop the bleeding temporarily.

Santana handed the Hurricanes their first scoreless innings of the game until allowing three runs in the bottom of the fifth to put them in a 6-1 hole.

"We were down 8-1 Sunday [against Louisiana Lafayette] and climbed back in it," Price said.

Despite having the second ranked offense in the Sun Belt Conference, the Golden Panthers could only produce two hits and one run through six innings of play.

Although Hurricanes starting pitcher Manny Miguelez gave up one run to center fielder Cody Jacobs, the Golden Panthers were hitting the ball well, recording several hard line drive outs. 

Miguelez's control was not an issue as he allowed no walks in the game, but he hit left fielder James McOwen on the shoulder in the top of the fourth inning. McOwen did not charge the mound, but he did take a long look at Miguelez as he walked towards first. 

McOwen led off the top of the seventh inning with his team still trailing by five runs.

Facing Miguelez once again, he lost control of a pitch and nearly hit McOwen in the head. On the next pitch, he drove a double down the first baseline.

The double would be the catalyst to a six-run seventh inning as a series of singles and doubles, mixed with an errant throw by Miguelez, gave the Golden Panthers the lead for the first time in the game at 7-6.

The lead would last briefly thanks to an RBI single by the Hurricane's Yonder Alonso in the bottom of the seventh inning that tied the game. 

FIU left-handed reliever Evan Ellison held the Hurricanes scoreless from the seventh to ninth inning to force extra innings by keeping batters off-balance with his overpowering fastball.

"He's been coming on lately and he's been the pitcher showing the most promise," Price said. 

Bautista took the plate in the top of the tenth inning behind a boisterous Hurricane crowd against senior reliever Danny Gil. Bautista, who had been struggling in the past few games, crushed a ball over left field to take a two-run lead in the top of the tenth. 

He finished the night going 2-for-4, while driving in three runs.

Heading to the bottom of the tenth, Ellison and Bautista were poised to be the heroes of the game.

 Bautista had handled four different pitchers and hit the go ahead home run. 

Ellison had pitched critical innings and that would've given him the win.

However, Hurricane freshman third baseman Mark Sobolewski had other plans and sent an Ellison fastball over center field to tie game again.

Ellison finished with six strikeouts through two and two-thirds innings. 

Price said he brought the freshman back out despite the pitch count because Ellison has been a starter in the past.

"The most important thing is the pitch count. And he's a freshman and he comes back strong usually," Price said. 

The Hurricanes ended the seesaw battle when shortstop Ryan Jackson singled to center field against relief pitcher Walker Whitley, driving in the game-winning run. 

 The two clubs will meet again on April 11 at University Park Stadium.

"I promise you one thing: if our pitching holds up then we'll do fine," Bautista said.

Headline: Teammates organize tournament to aid friend's ailing mother
Author: Sarah Cardone / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
While most students receive phone calls of congratulations and encouragement prior to receiving their degree, Keila Oliveira received a phone call that was far worse. 

The junior setter was completing her associates in arts degree at Miami-Dade College so that she could transfer to a division one school to continue her volleyball career, when she received the news that her mother, Lidia Oliveira, who had overcome breast cancer earlier that year, had a new battle to fight.

Doctors in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where her mother resides, had found a tumor only an inch from her brain. 

"I was freaked out," Oliveira said. "I wanted to go back home, but I had to stay here because I didn't have money to go." 

After finally being able to visit her mother, she decided that coming back to the United States would be the best idea. 

She realized that supporting her mother financially would be the best way that she could help her. 

"Over there, I was just another person. The treatment is really expensive over there," she said. "In case anything happened [to her], I had to know that I did everything that I could [to help her]."

As hard as it is for Oliveira to maintain her volleyball career, her classes on two different campuses and her part-time job at Miami-Dade College as assistant volleyball coach, she still manages to overcome everything that has been thrown her way despite the continuous fear and doubts that permeate her thoughts each day. 

"I get really tired," she said of her daily routine. "But my coach and teammates have been so supportive. It feels like God's hands have been carrying me and people have been helping me without knowing me or my mom."

Despite the distance between them, Oliveira said that her mother wants her to chase her dreams.

"My mom was a volleyball player and she has been following my whole career," she said. "She knows how much I love volleyball and how much I have improved. She made a wall with my awards [on it] and is really supportive and tells me, 'Go, because you're not going to make any difference here."'

Making a difference is exactly what Oliveira is doing with the help of her teammates and coach Danijela Tomic. 

After learning of her mother's condition, Oliveira made the decision to live off campus so she could collect more scholarship money to send home so her family can pay for her mother's treatment. 

Oliveira admits that Tomic's support has made many things possible. 

"[Coach Tomic] is the kind of person that cares about you as a person, not only as an athlete or how you perform. She cares about your personal life," Oliveira said. 

Tomic's and the rest of the team's concern for Oliveira and her mother is clearly evident in the effort they have put into planning a volleyball fund-raiser in which all proceeds will be donated to Lidia. 

The Play for a Cause Volleyball Tournament was thought of and organized by Tomic and a number of eager volunteers, including business professor Chris Ellis, who has encouraged many of his students to participate or volunteer in the fund-raiser. 

Besides appreciating the role she plays on the court, Tomic is also very fond of her junior setter as a person. 

"She is the height of our team, playing the position she plays," Tomic said. "Being a setter, everything runs through Keila. She is a natural leader. The whole team looks up to what she does and how she leads. I'm very proud of her." 

Although there was some trouble planning the event at first, Tomic has made a strong effort to follow all rules and regulations, and has successfully made the tournament a reality. 

"It was a miracle. Everything has been a miracle," Oliveira said, after her coach surprised her with the fund-raiser tournament.

Tomic felt this was the least she could do for Oliveira.

"Our players usually do stuff for the community, so why not do something for her?" 

As a coach, Tomic said that she finds it hard to see one of her athletes struggling and being emotionally drained. 

"We ask our athletes to do a lot of things: be good students, perform well in the classroom and the gym, be the best that you can be. But when your mind is constantly on your mom, 24-7 fighting cancer, how can you do all of those things?" Tomic said. "The burden of Keila helping her family financially is very hard." 

The tournament is set to take place April 14 at the Pharmed Arena. 

It is open to all ages, levels, both men and women. 

There is a $20 fee per person to participate. 

Applications for the tournament can be found online on the Athletic Department's website.

"Come for a day, have fun, play for a cause," Tomic said. 

As for how Keila's mom feels about all of this, Oliveira said that she's very excited about it.

"I wish I could bring her here so everyone could meet her." 

Oliveira is hoping that come graduation, Lidia will be calling to celebrate her daughter's degree in physical therapy as well as her own triumph over cancer.

Headline: Athletics department enthusiastic over new changes
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
New athletic director Pete Garcia means business. 

On Oct. 16, his first day on the job, he announced that 16 football players would be indefinitely suspended and two would be dismissed from the team following the FIU-University of Miami brawl - a harsher punishment than what the Sun Belt Conference had recommended.

"We have a vision that starts with [President Modesto A. Maidique]," Garcia said. "He wants to get better, not necessarily bigger anymore. It's now a matter of quality, and it's going to take hard work, energy, and the right people - people who share that vision." 

Getting the right people on board has meant the departure of some familiar faces in athletics, both student-athletes and coaches.

On Nov. 15, founding head football coach Don Strock announced his resignation. Former University of Miami assistant coach Mario Cristobal replaced Strock in December. 

On Feb. 10, just three months later, Garcia announced that Thomas Chestnutt Jr., a former assistant coach at Fresno State University, would replace Everton Edwards, who had acted as head women's soccer coach for 22 seasons. 

When asked about his decision to fire Edwards, Garcia replied:

"The level of expectations and the bar are being raised. It's my job as athletic director to evaluate the people we have here. We want to win and we want to win the right way," he said. "No shortcuts."

Edwards amassed a 165-179-33 record while serving as head coach of the women's soccer program. Since 2003, the women's soccer team compiled an 18-43-7 record.

Sergio Rouco, who has been head coach of the men's basketball team for three seasons, recognized that Garcia has a different style of leadership. "I welcome [Garcia's] aggressiveness…He's taking us to another level." 

When asked if Garcia's firm approach worried him, Rouco said he preferred to focus on his and his team's performance.

"I can only control what I can control," he said "Winning a lot of ball games and making sure my kids represent this institution with a lot of class and with good academics." 

So far, things look good for Garcia. On Jan. 25, the Florida Board of Governors approved the financing of the multi-phase stadium expansion project. 

"This will be the crown jewel of the athletic department and the focus of the entire campus," said Garcia. 

The $55 million project will lead to the construction of a state-of-the-art 18,000 seat stadium and 100,000 square-foot Student Support Complex at University Park. It is scheduled to open for the 2008 football season but already has head football coach Mario Cristobal and Garcia thinking about the advantage it will create in recruiting. "South Florida is the ultimate talent pool when it comes to football, and the new stadium is going to help us wake that sleeping giant in our own backyard," Cristobal said.

Garcia sees it the same way. "Stadiums are landmarks at universities and are among the first things new or prospective students see," he said in a press release. "At this level of recruitment, first impressions count." 

Garcia is also getting a helping hand from students. He said that on Feb. 21, the University Fee Committee approved a $1.39 per credit increase in the student athletic fee, which will "support the athletic department and the new football stadium." 

Freshman Maria Mur supports the fee increase, but is wary of where the new funds will go and how the rest of the student body will receive it.

"I really hope [the fee] goes not only to football, which is always the big focus, but to other sports that don't get a lot of money," she said. "I think other people will mind, though, because every time they hear about money they get scared and what's football to them?"

But Garcia assured that there is a bigger picture for the future of FIU athletics. 

"We want to brand the university, create affinity, and give students, alumni, and faculty something they can rally around," said Garcia. "We want to be the glue that holds everyone together." 

And in order to make the glue stick, he said he wants FIU to win, and not just in football.  "[In five years], we're going to be Top 25 in a number of sports," Garcia said "We're going to have winning teams." 

His enthusiasm has also been felt on the field and in the training rooms. Though Rouco has had difficult seasons behind him and Cristobal inherited a team that went 0-12 last season, they are both optimistic of what the future will bring for their teams. 

"I haven't been as excited in my 20 years of coaching as I am this year," said Rouco. "We think this might be the biggest year in my tenure here." 

Or as Cristobal put it: "We have a monster in the making."

Headline: Candidates discuss their visions for FIU
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Beacon interviewed candidates for this year's Student Governmnet Association elections via e-mail.

Answers have been edited for space and grammar.

See the above box for candidates' full names and positions.

The following are the answers of candidates who responded to a mass e-mail.

Q: What are some of the goals that set you apart from other candidates running for the same position? 

Hernandez:  Running uncontested, all our goals are individual to me and [Arthur "AJ" Meyer] but many of them include: meal equivalence3plans for students who have meal plans, adding study space throughout campus for students, increasing the amount of laptops available to students in the library, working on an online-based academic advising system, among other things. 

Meyer: Being in Student Government for the past three years as SGA Intern President, Lower Division Representative and Representative At-Large (Speaker Pro-Tempore), I have accumulated a massive amount of knowledge about the inner workings of this great organization. Also, being an active student lobbyist for the University has given me the experience of dealing with local, state and federal legislators.

Dial: I find it important that tuition not be raised to pay for the athletic program. I believe that there are a lot of unforeseen corporate sponsorships that can be used to support the football program without costing students [more money]. I want to reduce housing costs so that they are comparable to the cost of housing off-campus. 

Jean: I intend to establish an items exchange website where FIU students may list items such as textbooks, furniture, electronics, lost and found listings and roommate postings. I also plan to work with Campus Safety to launch a safety and theft awareness campaign.

Concepcion: [The projects I wish to embark are as follows:] improving environmental health awareness across campus and the community, promoting the different cultural backgrounds of the student body, exposing the students to different backgrounds ... and making student government more accessible.

Labrador: Focusing on the financial aspect of going to college, I know that most FIU students work full-time and go to school full-time. Therefore, I have been focused on issues on a federal level such as the DREAM Act, the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, etc. 

Saintable: Two main things: I want students to know what's going on and to participate in initiatives. Apathy can't be eliminated but we can reduce it by motivating others. Secondly, I think we need a stronger presence in the bordering cities. 

Ruiz: Some of the things that I want to accomplish include researching payment plans for International Students, increasing attendance at games through the Adopt a Football Player program, increasing safety in the parking garages and increasing wireless access throughout campus. 

LaPointe: I intend to provide easier access to professor syllabi when registering for class and to improve and enhance current services. I intend to make faculty evaluations accessible through the MyFIU portal.

Andrade: [Running Unopposed]

Al-Abdullah: I believe my aspiration to revamp advising is the most dominating component of my platform. Recognizing a real need to personalize and individualize advising, we can ensure that our students graduate sooner and with more diligence. 



Q: What aspect of the University do you feel deserves most funding from SGA and why? 

Hernandez: I believe that the best aspect for most funding is organizations where students get the most out of what their funds are going to. 

Meyer: I believe that every aspect of the University needs to be fully funded. However, this unfortunately is very difficult to achieve due to the lack of money we receive from the state, as well as our affordable tuition rates. 

Dial: Funding needs to be put into student-involvement on campus, especially the [Student Organizations Council]. 

Jean: Student organizations deserve the most funds from SGA.

Concepcion: Safety and communication across all organizations deserve the most funding because it is through these two variables that we can improve the quality of our academic strength and campus involvement.

Labrador: Every organization that provides benefits or services to BBC Students deserves careful consideration of its proposed budget and objectives and as long as the request is reasonable and manageable.

Saintable: [Did not provide answer]

Ruiz: I believe that the Graham Center deserves the most funding because it serves as a welcoming center for visitors and incoming freshmen. 

LaPointe:   I don't feel there is a grave need for more funding anywhere in specific. I feel SGA does a great job at distributing the funds fairly and equally. 

Andrade: There is no aspect that deserves the most funding. They are all important; however, certain issues take more precedence over others. We, SGA, must address the issue that affect the student body the most and several concerns have been the shuttle service between BBC and UP and the dining variety and hours. 

Al-Abdullah: I think we can invest more money to keep amenities like the Breezeway Cafe, the housing quad pool and the gym open longer hours for the convenience of the students.



Q: How will next year's SGA be different than this year's? 

Hernandez:  This coming administration is seeking to get as many students involved in SGA as much as possible. For instance, our cabinet this year although still appointed will be sought-out through an application/recommendation where we will try to seek out different leadership talent throughout the University that may be interested in joining [SGA], but have not been given the opportunity to. Also, we are involving students throughout FIU 25 IdeaRaisers, where we will be seeking the concerns and issues students have about the University and collaborate the top 25 issues for this year and for FIU's future. 

Meyer: New administration, new vision, new drive!

Dial: If elected, I want this year's SGA to be more involved with the decisions that affect students, whether they are from a University decision or a state decision.I think that SGA needs to be more involved with the decisions that affect all students, rather than minor details that affect few.

Roseme: Next year's SGA will be different than this year's in the way it communicates with students, the methods it uses to keep its officials accountable and in the relationships. Next year's SGA will maintain better relationships with organizations that are critical to sustaining its connection with students, such as WRGP Radiate FM and The Beacon.

Concepcion: I plan to make the upcoming SGA student representatives more accessible and approachable. 

Labrador: SGA will be different next year because of changes that I've helped shape in the structure of SGA. We've clearly defined what positions do [what] and are making ourselves more accountable to students. SGA will have an Open Door Policy that will enable students to address any issue they have with us. 

Saintable: Next year, we want to top [this year] and we want to get students to be more informed and active in the activities of SGA. Communication is key and students need to be accountable for elected leaders; it's your job to make sure we do our job.

Ruiz: I want to encourage students to know more about the candidates so that we can have higher retention within the council. I think the biggest problem within SGA is that a lot of positions get dropped and then there's no one to finish their work. I want the students to elect responsible candidates so that next year's council follows through on all their goals.

LaPointe:   Next year, will be a council of unity and drive, dedicated to the students of FIU to help enhance the already distinguished university.

Andrade: Next year's SGA, will enhance the level of communication between all campuses and increase the visibility among the students. 

Al-Abdullah: I am very excited because of the competence of all the candidates running.

Headline: Commentary: Campaign schedule hurts '07 elections
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I know Daylight Saving's time took place recently, but did anyone tell the Student Government Association this was an excuse to shorten this year's campaign schedule?

For the last couple of years, students walking around University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus during this part of the semester would have been blitzed with glossy flyers, fluorescent t-shirts and mobs yelling reasons why their candidates were the best qualified.

However, this year I've noticed an almost complete lack of campaigning.

Sure, there have been a few hopefuls standing around tables in the Graham and Wolfe University centers. Though this approach might work if these were the first days of a lengthy campaign drive, lets consider the following:

A) The candidates for both campuses were officially announced April 4 (Wednesday night, to be exact).

B)  The elections are April 10 and 11 (this Tuesday and Wednesday).

C)  There are almost no students on campus Friday through Sunday.

Although the students technically have seven days to campaign, I'm not counting Wednesday because the UP candidates were announced so late, as well as the days reserved for voting.

Based on this, it seems to me that our future SGA representatives have only two full days (Thursday and Monday) to share their vision and goals with an FIU student who would vote Tuesday morning.

For an organization that complains it cannot get enough student participation during elections, I am dumbfounded by this year's schedule, which seems detrimental to that goal.

Last year's official candidate list was announced on a Monday afternoon. This gave the contenders an additional 2 ½ days to campaign (half of Monday and all of Tuesday and Wednesday).

Even with this amount of time, voter turnout decreased by about 50 percent from 2005 to 2006 at UP, most likely the result of an uncontested presidential ticket.

The number of candidates running for president itself seems to be an important factor in getting students to participate in the voting process.

Yes, BBC had one of its highest turnouts in 2006 (752 students) when there were three presidential candidates, but when there was an uncontested ticket for that position in 2004, less than 100 students voted.

With another unopposed presidential candidate and a shorter schedule, how does the Student Government Council at UP expect this year's voter attendance to be better than last year's dismal show?

Plans to place a polling site at the Engineering Center fell through and the councils could not agree whether to allow online voting or not.

The best idea SGC-UP had to increase participation is to offer students the chance to win a round-trip airline ticket, courtesy of American Airlines.

No matter how many voters this incentive may bring, nothing can hide the fact that this ploy reeks of bribery.

Voting should be a willful act, a chance for members of a democratic government to choose leaders they feel will best represent their interests, goals and ideas, not a chance to score a Cancun ticket.

Though this scheme may bring in a few desired voters, it's possible that some of these students are voting for a free vacation, not because they know the issues and the candidate's platforms.

Our paper itself has tried to help SGA's candidates get their message across.

However, The Beacon was also affected by the short schedule.

Traditionally, our staff interviews presidential, representative-at-large and lower division representatives from both campuses the week before elections. We then print an extensive platform review along with our recommendations in an effort to give students an in-depth look at the candidates. This also creates a public forum where they can share their views on the University and student life.

Unfortunately, we could not get the list of contenders until the middle of last week, which was not enough time to schedule interviews.

I regret that this section didn't run, since I feel it is an integral part of educating voters.

The number of campaigning days isn't the only thing that was cut short - the sources of information for this year's candidates are also limited.

Though flyers may have littered the campuses for days after elections, we at least knew who the candidates were and for what they stood.

Headline: Sexual assault awareness part of annual event
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
Donald Bermudez, a junior at Miami-Dade College, admitted to not knowing much about the issue of women and sexual assault before having attended the Take Back the Night event on April 5. Bermudez heard about the event through Helen Muniz, an FIU senior and his girlfriend. By the end of the night, Bermudez said he was glad he had attended.

"It's a pretty big issue with a worldwide basis for women and men because they are affected, too," he said.

Take Back the Night at FIU consists of an annual march and rally. At the event, students can stop at different tables stationed around the campus. Each table addresses a different topic, but the theme for the tables is always the same: Promoting awareness to both men and women about what sexual assault and domestic violence actually means, when and where and how often it occurs, and how to put an end to it.

Funded by the Student Government Association, this year, the University Park campus's version of the event occurred from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and was moved to the inside of the Graham Center because of last minute, rainy weather, but the event still drew in about 50 people.

The event was put together by a planning committee that represented various departments and student organizations at FIU. 

Senior Gloria Bauta was part of the committee, representing Stonewall Pride Alliance, a club that caters to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and questioning community and its allies.  As a survivor of date rape, Bauta stressed that men would benefit the most from the event.

"If women survivors are invisible, the way that we treat male survivors is insulting because people don't believe [sexual assault] happens to men," Bauta said. "The most important message of this event is that 'yes means yes and everything else means means no.'"

Onorato began the night by giving a brief history about the event. She went on to cite statistics regarding sexual assault. 

Frankie Cedeno, a peer educator from the Victim Advocacy Program, performed an interior dialogue with fellow peer educator, Noelle Service, comparing a "bad date" to a "healthy date." Cedeno became involved with the event because he had been educated about sexual assault and domestic violence by his father.

"My dad raised me to respect women through example, but many men don't have that experience and I am here to educate these guys," Cedeno said.

The crowd was then sectioned off into small groups led by a committee member in order to march and visit the stations. One table put together by the Women's Studies Student Association and the Step Up student organization designed to cater to disabled students with special needs, allowed people to dip their hands in paint and create a handprint on a banner in order to show commitment to helping stop sexual assault and domestic violence. 

Peg Thatcher, the president of the Project to End Rape became involved with the issue five years ago when her daughter was raped. She told the crowd to change their paradigm shifts and believe there can be an end to rape in the world. She also told the crowd they could begin to be "agents of change" by filling out a declaration card and pledge to no longer "tolerate the persistence of rape on earth."

"Its time to end [rape]. This issue is 30,000 years old, and it does not need to be 31,000 years old," Thatcher said.

The cards collected that night were later pasted onto a black poster demanding the end of rape.

Onorato said she believes one of the solutions to the issue of sexual assault is to educate men in terms of realizing that when a woman says no, she does not always mean she is saying no but really means yes.

"Men are taught to figure out that by pushing a woman even when she's saying no or asking to stop in any type of intimate relationship, and it sucks," Onorato said, "Together, we can all make a change."
