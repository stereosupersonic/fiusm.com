Headline: Journalist to deliver Women's Month keynote address
Author: Daniella Bonilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In celebration of Women's History Month, the Women's Center and Studies Programs will host a keynote address on "Women of the World in the Twenty-First Century: Status, Power and Women's Leadership" by the Los Angeles Times' Chief Diplomatic Correspondent Robin Wright. The address will begin tomorrow at 4 p.m.

The Women's Center, along with the Women's Studies Program participates and organizes most of the events during Women's History month. Women's Center Director Dr. Karen Garner takes great pride in the appreciation and presentation of great women during Women's History Month.

"The reason why we are here [The Women's Center], is because historically the needs and issues of women have not been addressed by institutions, as that of higher education," Garner said. "Susana Rose [Women Studies Affiliate] and I, were trying to bring someone of high stature and who could inspire other women with her achievements."

Wright is an international lecturer, an honorary fellow Yale, Stanford and Duke Universities and she has reported from more than 130 countries on six different continents.

"We see Ms. Wright as a role model for women and for students of
Journalism," Garner said.

Having documented nine wars and numerous revolutions, Wright has researched the changing dynamics, activities and effects of militant Islamic countries and the Arab World.

"She is a very timely speaker," Garner said. "She has been doing this for 10 years, and has taken a lot of risks. She has really gone against lots of expectations that have been placed upon her by the social customs of the Arab World, where women are behind the scenes. She has done something pretty phenomenal for being a Western woman."

Wright won the Weintal Prize for Most Distinguished Diplomatic Reporting. Wright has also won the 1989 National Magazine Award for her coverage from Iran in the New Yorker and has also received the Overseas Press Club Award for "best reporting in any medium requiring exceptional courage and initiative" for her documentation of African Wars.

"She is a scholar as well as a journalist," Garner said. "She really gets involved in her stories. She does a lot of study in the culture, language, background and history of the people or country she works on."
Since the Sept. 11 terrorist actions, Robin Wright has traveled with Secretary of State Colin Powell, covering United States diplomacy and its stance against terrorism.

"She has gained the respect of world, religion and community leaders and has dealt with people who possess a high level of authority," Garner said.

Subheadline: Women's basketball team opens against Creighten
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team found out their NCAA Tournament fate late Sunday and the No. 5 Golden Panthers will travel to State College, PA for the first and possible second round game in the Mideast Regional.

FIU (26-5) will open the 64-team tournament on Friday against 24-9 Creighton. A win set-up a second round game between the Golden Panthers and the winner of a match-up between host Penn St. and Tennessee-Chattanooga.

"We have a good chance to win the first two rounds," forward Cheryl Moody said. "Then comes Connecticut and their time comes if we make it."

FIU's players knew coming into the announcement Sunday that they were in the tournament, thanks to the automatic bid that accompanied the program's first ever Sun Belt Championship. The only question that remained was the team's seeding and whether or not the Golden Panthers would host the opening two rounds.

"I thought we had a really good chance [to host]," head coach Cindy Russo said. "There's just a lot of variables that go into it."

FIU takes a 12-game winning streak into the tournament.
The Golden Panthers are 2-4 versus this year's NCAA Tournament field, defeating Colorado St and Stephen F. Austin. Connecticut, Drake, Virginia and Boston College have defeated FIU.

Headline: In Our View: Women's basketball team needs university, fan support
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As the women's basketball team boards a bus to head to State College, PA, to play in the first and possibly second round game in the Mideast Regional of the NCAA Tournament, they leave behind an empty Golden Panther Arena: An all-too familiar site for the players and coaches. 

As the football push continues to swarm over the university, the women's basketball team has put together one of the best teams in its history. Yet, the seats remain empty, the cheers come from family and friends. 

What else can really be asked from a team that does exactly what it's supposed to: win games?

As the 26-5 Golden Panthers head into the tournament, the university and its students need to get behind a team that's played their hearts out all season. It wouldn't be a stretch to say FIU would be hosting one of the regional games if fan support had been consistent throughout the season. 

Who can blame the NCAA for making the No. 5 ranked Golden Panthers high-step it out of town? It would be doubly embarrassing for the team to host a game and have an empty crowd to greet them. 

Though an argument can be made about the facilities, if the fan support were there, it wouldn't be much of a problem to have FIU host the game.

Students and the university need to lend a hand to the athletic department. The teams aren't made up of random basketball players picked up from who knows where. 

These are students who are giving up their time and a big chunk of their lives to not only advance themselves, but do something they love for their school. It reeks of high school pep rallies, but students need to come out and support their university.

Columnist unfairly portrays republicans

To the editor:

Jason Andreasen was somewhat unfair to the Republican party in his column in last week's issue of The Beacon. The party has not lost touch with America's youth; it has simply been true to its admittedly conservative core values. Explaining the complex nature of conservatism is difficult and would be the subject of a very long [letter] in its own right (and even then the effort would fall short).  

Still, for our purposes let us assume that "conservative" does not equal "backward" which seems to be the contension of the columnist.

It is true that young people tend to rebel against the traditional values and strong notions of responsibility that comprise the conservative message, but is this the fault of the messenger?  I think not. 

Andreasen also argues that Republicans must shed some of "their ultra-conservative views" or be seen as "one step away from the Big Brother state-of-mind." But if Republicans are "Ultra-conservative" then by what standard?  The media is largely left of center and routinely shows bias by making conservatives look extreme while labeling clearly liberal notions and politicians as moderate. 

Media coverage of the issues surrounding Second Amendment rights is a glaring example of this. Republicans do have a real voter base and are not seen by rational, fair people as being anything close to fascists. 

Besides, to look at the other side of things, some Democratic notions such as "political correctness" are frightening to this student and smack of the kind of censorship of the mind found in "1984." Does newspeak ring a bell?  

As we can see, if you're standing at one pole, the folks at the other end of the political spectrum look very bizarre and yes, even Orwellian.

To be fair to Andreasen, he was right in saying that Republicans do look very foolish when they try to pander to young people. 

As with everyone else, young people vote based on their judgment as it is informed by the facts that they have (again,haha media bias comes into play) and their personal ideology.

Engineering article too concerned with negative aspects

To the editor:

The recent article headlined "Engineering Dean, Students Strive for Change" does not fully represent what has been going on here at the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) or the philosophy of the Dean's office as I understand it.

[Much] has happened here in the recent past. For instance, we now have a new student parking lot, an engineering library, increased hours for all computer labs, and even a new copier for engineering students. These items, and many more, are coming in to reality because the new dean, Dr. Vish Prasad, has publicly stated that the new philosophy for the College of Engineering is: "The student is number one!" This has been demonstrated by his interest, investment of time and financial support for the many engineering societies and student events.

These accomplishments, we are often told, are only possible because the dean has been given support from the administration.  

In the interest of fair and balanced reporting, why were these points not mentioned? The College of Engineering has a lot to provide to its students. It offers great services, which keeps improving with time, and holds outstanding facilities. We recently had the Engineering Gala for over one thousand local middle and high school students, as well as the Deputy Director of the National Science Foundation here to show off our facilities. This was mentioned to the reporter, but that wasn't picked up either.  

Did somebody just selectively print only the negatives without even acknowledging the progress we are making?

Headline: Point-Counterpoint: independent cinema
Subheadline: Independent, foreign films equivalent to cinematic tripe
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
A short while ago, on a night where I was too broke to go anywhere, I rented a movie. My friends brought it from Blockbuster and believing they had chosen wisely I unwittingly pressed play. From the start of the opening credits I could here my poor brain cells screaming "Help! Help!" and running down my ear canal to commit suicide. 

We were watching "Cube" an independent film filled with bad acting and a worthless plot. At the end of the night I asked, "What the hell?" The ensuing discussion never was finished. 

I've been told independent films are an expression, a statement the artists want to make to the world. What do I care? 

Honestly, how many of us watch a movie because we want to know how a writer or director sees this world? Movies are meant for one thing alone: to entertain. If you want to make your statement to the world,  entertain us.

Good writers and directors know how to weave entertainment and statement into a powerful film. "What Dreams May Come," for instance, was a good movie with a powerful message,  and it was excellent. Since "Cube" I've begun to associate "independent" with bad cinema.

Here's a film you might be familiar with: "The Blair Witch Project," a classic example of American vulnerability to marketing tactics. It grossed more than twice its cost at the box office, but how many of us can say we enjoyed the movie? 

If I wanted to see a jumpy camera running through the woods or view the opening of someone's nostrils I don't need to go farther than my own home movies. 

At least I have the decency to keep them in my home and not try to exploit the American people by wasting their time with trash. Even some famous actors of today hide dirty little secrets. 

Ewan McGregor, who plays Obi Wan Kenobi in the new Star Wars movies, is the main character of a strange film entitled "Shallow Grave." This movie takes the concept of a disgusting film like "Very Bad Things" and makes it worse. The movie is a nightmare with neither coherency nor entertainment value. Who wants to see something like that? I apologize to all those masochists out there who might enjoy it but most people would find the film revolting.

Hollywood is a cinematic trial ground. If you can make it through the process of making a movie in Hollywood, your end product will be a refined film. It provides a buffer zone between the people wanting to put a home video on the big screen by passing it through the eyes of industry professionals who know how to present a topic; professionals who know how to inform and entertain. 

Would a writer publish a paper without first proof reading it? Would a scientist present data without testing it first? Why should the film industry be any different, check your work before giving it to the masses and keep the junk off our screen.

Headline: FIU cultural events beneficial to students
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
I often hear students say the opinion section is always filled with complaints against FIU.  Well, not today.  I actually want to applaud FIU this time for its efforts to promote cultural awareness and education.

A couple of weeks ago, an opinion writer expressed her abhorrence for the FIU club scene, and I was glad to see other people shared my views. 

I honestly think a higher learning institution should aim at promoting socialization through events rich in culture.  

Unfortunately, in the past I did not consider this one of FIU's qualities.

However, the FIU social scene has taken a radical shift towards artistic displays that emphasize creativity.  For the past three weeks I have witnessed some serious cultural performances that have made my student life so much more enjoyable.

During Black History Month the variety of performances was extraordinary and focused on illustrating the richness and diversity of Black culture. I saw how many people enjoyed the shows and gathered around with an eager interest to see and learn.  

The performances usually encouraged student interaction, and I actually found myself doing an African relaxation dance in the middle of Graham Center with a crowd of FIU students.  I felt brand new and had lots of energy upon returning to class.

Last week, Spring Culture Fest kept the cultural chain going, and talent was all around the campus atmosphere.  The Women's Poetry Slam was filled with creative people from beginning to end.  It was nice to see men and women participate in this event and most people were thankful for getting a chance to do something different and fulfilling.

It was so nice to walk into GC for a whole week and not have to hear loud rap lyrics. 

I am not trying to be a puritan, but I just believe that everything has a time and a place. 

If I were at a club, I would not criticize the choice of music. But there is not one good reason why FIU should constantly play the same music.   

I enjoyed standing by the pit (which I previously called the "pit from hell" due to all the weird behavior that took place there) and watching a group of young men perform an excellent step show.

The bottom line is that FIU is certainly improving, and I just hope this cultural outburst is not just a phase. Schools that wish to grow and expand, as FIU does, need to focus on always striving to prioritize education over socialization.  

Yes, it is great to have fun and relax, because students do feel a lot of stress.  Biscayne Bay Campus is proof of how a ghost town atmosphere can discourage students from going to class.  I almost changed my major when I found out the School of Journalism was at BBC. 

We just need to choose better ways to socialize, and I believe the FIU community is starting to do so.  Personally, I think it ridiculous when people promote bouncing up and down to rap music as the only way of providing entertainment to young students. 

The fact that we are young does not mean students only enjoy meaningless activities.

Miami is very rich in culture, and FIU should continue to entice students to show their potential.  It is important to learn about other cultures, to see how they dance, how they eat, how they pray, etc.  This is one of the best ways to spread tolerance.

It is already hard for young people to enjoy cultural events here in the United States because theater and many other artistic events are so expensive that they are considered elitist art forms.  It is not like in Spain, where people go out for bread and end up going to a play because cultural events are readily accessible to everyone

Therefore, schools should really push towards providing free, artistic events. 

I am not suggesting that we turn FIU into a Renaissance festival or to always have a DJ playing Tchaikovsky.  

On the contrary, I feel FIU's approach of student-based talented performances is the best way to connect with a young, multicultural, urban crowd.  

Once again I praise our school's efforts to do something different, and I believe cultural activities really do feed the soul and brings us up to another level.  

Students who get a chance to be empowered by displaying their artistic abilities might feel they can improve as human beings and might even get inspired to work harder on their academics. FIU's cultural wave can only bring benefits.

Winners

FIU Women's Basketball: We know we've had you as a winner in the past, but we just can't ignore what you've accomplished. Congratulations on being Sun Belt Conference champions; maybe next year, students will go to your games.

Spring Culture Fest: Congratulations for bringing some culture to FIU. It's nice to expose students to something other than cellphone plans every now and then.

Women's History Month: Maybe this month we'll hear less about the football team and more about the cheerleaders. Seriously, wouldn't it be better if women's history month were celebrated every 28 days?

Losers

Golden Panther Arena: Hosting a televised NCAA tournament game would have brought some recognition to the school. In way it's a good thing. This way the nation wont be able to see the lack of spirit and the empty seats.

Time Machine: With all the hype, you had nowhere to go but down. Of course, that time machine would come in handy for late assignments.

ABC:  Replacing a serious news show like "Nightline" with David Letterman tells us you'll do anything for ratings. Choosing stupid human tricks over journalistic integrity speaks volumes about you.

Headline: Point-Counterpoint:  Independant Cinema
Subheadline: Independent, foreign films allow for originality
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
How many times have we seen this scenario before: A protagonist is introduced in a film. He or she has a clear goal and a set of problems that stand in their way from achieving that goal. In the end, he's successful. If you haven't already noticed, that is the standard formula for Hollywood in general. Sometimes this formula is pulled off in new and interesting ways, sometimes good films come as a result of this, but the fact remains we've seen it all before. Not only are the movies formulaic, but the filmmaking in general is always the same.  Filmmaking techniques are nothing but a copy and paste job in most of the films that are currently jammed down our throats by our colossally shallow movie industry. 

Hollywood standard films are usually interested in one thing and one thing only: making money.  Artistic expression, social commentary and originality be damned. This is a sad fact when you consider the power film can possess if treated correctly to alter our perceptions, to bring to light new and interesting subjects. 

The majority of times, big studios refuse to tackle subjects that they feel the American public might find objectionable.  The reason for this is simple.  People don't like to think, especially when watching a movie.  Most of the time, they simply want a good thrill or a corny romance they can live vicariously through.  If you don't give them what they want, your picture sinks at the box office. Sadly, however, standard films are fixated on one way of being and one form of cinema, because it sells, and people are not exposed to new things.  Most of the time many of these films accomplish little else but a reinforcement of stereotypes.  

Tokenism for instance, occurs constantly. That's when a Hollywood standard film really doesn't want to cast a minority in the lead role, but makes them the sidekick or the best friend, or worse yet, the enemy, in order to remain politically correct.  We all probably remember the line from Scary Movie Two (an equally bad movie):  "I'm the token black guy, my job is to say 'bling, bling' and 'that is whack.'"  Although that film is a parody, the sad thing is that tokenism happens all the time.

African-Americans aren't the only ones who suffer this kind of transparent representation. Hispanics and other minorities do as well. As a Hispanic woman, I myself have cringed when faced with the token Hispanic girl, who's sole purpose is to be the best friend who says things like "damn, chica!" and does the sign of the cross at random moments.   

Homosexuals as well are grossly under-represented. I am sick of seeing the stereotypical gay guy presented in movies always as the best friend and never in a relationship. Stereotypical lesbians are sometimes shown, usually as a giant cop named Bertha with no sense of humor. Independent and foreign cinema is usually the only place that affords homosexuals proper representation, or at least, allows them to be shown in relationships. Films like "The Wedding Banquet," "When Night is Falling" and "But I'm a Cheerleader" dare to approach homosexual subjects, but sadly, most people have probably never heard of them.

So what happens when a film dares to move beyond the Hollywood formula?  It's simple. A film won't get funded. Studios simply will not pay for these movies most of the time, and what you are left with are great movies forced to work with small budgets and forced to cut corners.  They can't afford the best actors.  They can't afford the best equipment.  Hollywood shuns them in the worst way possible, by allowing them to exist without their support and making people think that only big studios can make good movies. The sad thing is that the big studios are more likely to give big budgets and spend millions on advertisement on cinematic tripe like "Saving Silverman" or several "Jurassic Park" sequels rather than innovative films with original plotlines. 

That's why it was great to see "The Blair Witch Project" become such a success.  People criticize the camera work and acting, but I would like to point out that the film was made on a $75,000 budget. That's probably not enough to pay for breast implants in Hollywood, much less a feature film. And were the big studio horror films it was up against that year any better?  "The Haunting" cost nearly $80 million dollars to make and was the cheesiest movie I've seen in a long time.

So for those of you that have been brainwashed by the movie industry, remember that good movies are continually made outside of it, films that merit your support.  Independant and foreign films are often a great way to watch interesting storylines big Hollywood studios would never give the time of day, like "Trainspotting," "Run Lola Run," "Amores Perros," and "Together." Watch these films, because the truth is that big studios depend on what sells, which means you, the viewer, have all the power.

Headline: Baseball completes perfect 5-0 week
Author: Alex Braswell, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU went a perfect 5-0 this week to improve their record to 15-4. FIU had back-to-back shutouts against Fairfield and Leigh and showed no mercy against winless Wagner, outscoring  the Seahawks 57-4 over the three game series. FIU's game against LaSalle on Thursday was rained out. 

FIU 22, Wagner 0

FIU had control of the game in the first inning, with 10 scored runs.
Derek DeCarlo (4-0) pitched six innings and allowing only one hit while striking out eight. 

FIU sent 14 batters to the plate. 

Suarez continued to shine as a new offensive power for FIU as he jacked a two-RBI homerun over the left field wall for his third homerun in two games, his total for the season. 

Skip Adams and Dennis Diaz also had big days as Adams went 3-5 for 5 RBIs and Diaz went 4-6. 

"Sometimes you run into games like this when your team will get real hot," head coach Danny Price said of the three game weekend series against Wagner. "I thought our pitching did really well, and we got a chance to swing the bat and work on our base running."

FIU 11, Fairfield 0

FIU shutout Fairfield (2-1) on  DeCarlo's (3-0) seven innings of shutout pitching, giving up only five hits and striking out 12."It was a cold day but you got to come out and be ready [to pitch] no matter what the elements are," DeCarlo said. "I worked on my curveball but there is always room for improvement."

Bernie Gonzalez started the bottom of the third inning with a triple down the right field wall. Tommy Dueñas followed with an RBI single to left field to bring in Gonzalez. 

Alex Ansoleaga then hit a two-RBI double to center field to bring in Hector Penate and Diaz for a 8-0 FIU lead.

FIU 7, Leigh 0

FIU shutout Leigh University (4-2-1) 7-0 for its first back-to-back shutouts. Luis Grazitua (1-0) captured his first win as he pitched six solid 
innings, allowing two hits and recording nine strikeouts. 

"I was able to establish a rhythm and get ahead in the pitch count," Grazitua said.

FIU hit three solo homeruns in the last three innings of play. 

FIU 22, Wagner 3

FIU powered its way to a 22-3 blowout win over winless Wagner (0-8), hitting six homeruns, two by the offensive player of the game Alejandro Suarez. 

Suarez also had 3 RBIs, a double, a triple and just barely missed the 
hitter's cycle as he grounded hard to the shortstop in his final at-bat. 

"I'm not going to lie, I was hoping for the single," Suarez said. 

"But I was also trying to drive in [Penate]. It's not every day you have a day like this."

Michael Baluja (3-1) picked up the win as he pitched five innings, giving up no runs on three hits and striking out five batters.

Gonzalez, Eldred, Solomon Frieder and Michael New also hit the longball in the afternoon and just barely missed tying the school record of seven homeruns set in 1980.

Headline: Softball goes 3-3 at Speedline Tournament
Subheadline: Week begins with sweep of Wichita State
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU (19-16) went 3-3 at the Speedline tournament, hosted by the University of South Florida in Tampa, FL, losing to No. 23 Mississippi State (17-9), 3-2, in an extra inning first round game of the single elimination bracket.

"I think we did well. Pitching did well," head coach Kim Gwydir said. "Amanda Nealer, who was on the disabled with a sore hip, pitched three solid games."

Earlier in the week, Vanessa Preston pitched a six-hit shutout in game one of a doubleheader and Kendra Laminack allowed no earned runs in the nightcap leading FIU (16-13) to a sweep of Wichita State (6-9).

FIU 1, Wichita State 0

Howling winds and chilly temperatures made the FIU Softball Stadium seem more like Candlestick Park, but it was Preston's coolness and right arm that iced the Shockers' bats.

"I just wanted to win so badly and throw a whole game," Preston (4-4) said.  "I don't usually pitch well in the cold weather, but my team needed me and I had to step up."

The Shockers tested Preston's mettle when they opened the sixth inning with three straight singles to load the bases with no outs. 

Preston got the next three hitters.

"My only thoughts were to just get the batter.  I didn't even think about the situation," Preston said.  "But that is my favorite situation, bases loaded and 0 outs." 

Coach Kim Gwydir stuck with her ace right-hander.

"She had great breaking stuff tonight," Gwydir said.  "Vanessa is a Greg Maddux-type.  She's stubborn, paints the corners and knows how to pitch."

Right-fielder Kelly Nicosia, who went 2 for 3 with a stolen base, agreed.

"It's not easy to hold a 1-0 lead, but if anyone can [it's] Vanessa," Nicosia said.

FIU 5, Wichita State 3

With a defense reminiscent of the Bad News Bears, the Golden Panthers overcame five errors and a three-run deficit to sweep the Shockers, 5-3.

Laminack (5-3) held her own amid four errors in the first three innings.  

Laminack, who pitched a complete game and allowed no earned runs, didn't feel she was on top of her game either.

"I didn't feel like I was throwing good.  My curve was not working," Laminack said. 

"But like the team, I didn't lose confidence, because I knew we were going to get out of it."

Gwydir's faith in Laminack did not waver.

"I've got to give Kendra a lot of credit with her situation (3 unearned runs)," Gwydir said.  "A lesser person would have caved in, and although she's only a sophomore, she's a lot smarter."

FIU rallied to tie it at 3 in the third inning on Lesley Gillen's slicing double. Jennifer Owens' line drive single into left center field scored Wichita State-nemesis Kelly Nicosia to give FIU a lead it would never relinquish.

"We've been struggling with our offense, but we had to get it done," Owens said.  "I just saw the fastball and took a good swing."
Nicosia said.  "We're not scoring a lot of runs, so I just do whatever it takes to get on and just put the ball in play."

Georgia State 3, FIU 0

Nicosia continued her stretch of hitting by collecting two more hits, but the rest of the Golden Panthers could only muster three hits as Georgia State blanked FIU, 3-0.  

Preston suffered the loss in FIU's opener of the Speedline Invitational at the University of South Florida.

FIU 3, Houston 2

Amanda Nealer (6-4) pitched five innings in relief of Laminack and picked up the win.  Owens had a run-scoring single and Nicole Dubovik also contributed an RBI for FIU (17-14).

Maryland 1, FIU 0

Laminack pitched five strong innings, but it was Maryland's Jen Peel's RBI single that was the difference as FIU was shutout 1-0 by the Terrapins.  Kristen Perry had a single and a double for FIU (17-15).


FIU 2, BYU 1

Preston bounced back from her tournament opening defeat by hurling five shutout innings with six strikeouts to lift FIU past BYU, 2-1.  

Nealer came on in the sixth inning and shut the door on the Cougars.  
The Golden Panthers' scoring came on a pair of RBIs from Owens and Laminack.

FIU 7, Michigan State 2

The Spartans took an early 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first on a Natalie Furrow RBI single, but the Golden Panthers (19-15) came back in the third with four runs.

Subheadline: FIU conquers Sun Belt Conference with win over North Texas
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
They made it look easy. Almost too easy. And as expected, the women's basketball team was the one wearing the Sun Belt Conference Champion t-shirts and cutting down the basketball net on Tuesday afternoon.

The Golden Panthers (26-5) won the program's first Sun Belt trophy, as they defeated Western Division champion North Texas, 66-49, in New Orleans, LA.

Fifth seed FIU will travel to State College, PA to take on Creighton (24-6) in the first round ot the NCAA tourney. FIU returns to the tournament for the first time since the 1998-99 season thanks to the automatic bid earned along with the conference championship. 

The Sun Belt Champions will take a 12-game winning streak and 26-5 record into the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

"It was neat to see them so excited. They handled it really well," FIU head coach Cindy Russo said. "I think they expected to win. They had a lot of confidence all year long. The concentration was there."

That confidence and concentration was there for the entire 40 minutes against the Lady Eagles. After North Texas opened the scoring with a three-pointer, FIU went on an 11-0 run over the next five minutes and never looked back. 

Thanks to strong defense and rebounding, the Golden Panthers controlled the game from tip to finish.

Half way through the first half, Deniz Boz found Gergana Slavtcheva for a three, putting the Golden Panthers ahead by 10. Anita Heller, who came off the bench for five assists, then drove for a lay-up to increase the lead to 12.

The Lady Eagles would make a run and cut the lead to six.
The Golden Panthers took care of the ball early in the second. Up by nine at half-time, FIU hit its first five shots of the second. A Heller lay-up gave FIU a 16-point lead.

No Lady Eagle managed to score in double digits. Nicole Thomas led North Texas with nine points, followed by Jalie Mitchell and Vilma Gruismanauskaite with eight points each. As a team, the Lady Eagles shot 36 percent from the field. 

"I think that sometimes we don't think that the size of Florida International makes a big difference, but it does," North Texas head coach Tina Slinker said. "A lot of the things are taken away strictly from that."

Cheryl Moody, who had her 21st double-double of the season with a game-high 15 points, was named the tournament's most outstanding player. Slavtcheva and Cormisha Cotton were named to the All-Tournament team, together with Middle Tennessee's Jamie Thomatis and North Texas' Nicole Thomas and Mitchell.

"We were pretty confident today. But we knew [North Texas] could come back at any time and win it," Moody said. "We knew we couldn't underestimate them at all."

Cotton had 15 points, along with 11 rebounds and Mandy Shafer added 11 points. FIU shot 46 percent from the field, while focusing on the inside game. Cotton and Moody had 22 combined rebounds.

Headline: SPECIAL GAME PREVIEW: Looking to make a statement
Subheadline: Women's basketball hopes to unveil themselves to nation
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team might not have a chip on its shoulder, but it definitely plans to make a statement today against Penn State.

After not being named a host site for the NCAA Tournament and Cheryl Moody losing out to North Texas' Jalie Mitchell in the Sun Belt Player of the Year voting, FIU is feeling a little slighted.

"We're definitely overlooked in every way that you can think of," head coach Cindy Russo said. "This is a definitely a way to make a statement. This is going to be a major statement."

"I don't know if we have a chip on our shoulder," Mandy Shafer said. "It might be a motivation factor though."

Both FIU and Penn State have one clear focus coming into the game.

Penn State will look to limit the damage done by FIU's rebounding, while the Golden Panthers will place its attention on Kelly Mazzante, the nation's leading scorer.

"We would be out of our minds if we said that [rebounding wasn't the No. 1 priority]," Penn State head coach Rene Portland said.

FIU is fifth in the nation in rebounding margin and has out-rebounded its opponent 31 times this season. FIU is 27-4 in those games.

Portland has been unhappy with Penn State's rebounding, which ranks eighth in the Big Ten Conference.

"We always get out-rebounded," Portland said. "It's terrible."

The Lady Lions plan to use their guards in an attempt to overcome the inside presence of Moody, Gergana Slavtcheva and Cormisha Cotton.

"We are going to have to rebound by committee," Portland said. "We're going to have to get help from our guards."

The Golden Panther's rebounding even has the nation's leading scorer, Mazzante, thinking about boxing out, before scoring. 

"I think we have to box this team out and limit them to one shot," Mazzante said.

In the first round of the tournament, FIU won the battle on the boards 53-35. Penn State was out-rebounded 38-37.

Mazzante will receive most of the Golden Panthers' attention.

"We had a good practice and focused on her," Slavtcheva said. "Most of the time she had the ball."

"We have a game plan, which we hope to surprise you."

FIU hopes to be able to keep the Lady Lions' other scorers off the scoreboard, but Mazzante will remain the Golden Panthers' top priorities.

"You can't forget about the other players on the court, but the focus is still the player who averages 25 points per game," Shafer said. "We have to make the other players beat us."

&nbsp;
In a joint announcement by FIU and Sunshine Network, Golden Panther athletic director Rick Mello said Tuesday that the school's first-ever intercollegiate football game between FIU and St. Peter's College has been moved up two days to accommodate a statewide television audience.

Originally scheduled for Saturday, Aug. 31, the game will now take place
on Thursday evening, Aug. 29 at the FIU Community Stadium on the
University Park campus. Kick-off time is still TBD.

"The opportunity to have our first game televised around the state and
nationally via satellite goes a long way toward not only highlighting
our new venture with football but will also allow us to feature the
entire university," Mello said.

"Not only that, but this new date puts the football spotlight directly
on us whereas before, if the game was on Saturday, we would have been competing for fan and media attention and it takes the game out of
conflict with Labor Day weekend, a favorite travel time for many
families."

Headline: LATE-BREAKING Strong Finish for Women's Basketball
Subheadline: Women's basketball team defeats Creighton with second half surge
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
It took awhile, but once Gergana Slavtcheva and Mandy Shafer got going, FIU's women's basketball team took off into the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

The No. 5 seed Golden Panthers (27-5) defeated No. 12 Creighton (24-7) 73-58 thanks to a combined 26 second half points from Slavtcheva and Shafer, who had only three points each in the first.

FIU will now play host No. 4 seeded Penn State on Sunday at 6:36 p.m. The Lady Lions (22-11) also overcame a halftime deficit before going on to win 82-67 over Tennessee-Chattanooga.

"We just said to each other that we weren't going to lose this game," Shafer said.

After going into halftime trailing 32-28, FIU outscored Creighton 45-26 in the final 30 minutes to move on to the second round of the NCAA Tournament's Mideast region in State College, PA.

It was the seventh time this season that the Golden Panthers trailed at halftime and the team is 4-3 in those games.

"I just kept re-iterating the game plan," head coach Cindy Russo said. "I just kept re-iterating the game plan and telling them 'If you don't do it &#8211; you're not going to be successful."

That message was well received by Russo's players.

"The games that we lost [this season] were because we didn't stick with the game plan," Slavtcheva said. 

FIU took advantage of the Blue Jays' second half game plan. Unlike earlier in the game, Creighton began to collapse on Cheryl Moody inside.

"The thing that frustrated me the most early was that we talked so much about how [Creighton} was going to focus on blocking off Cheryl Moody," Russo said. "It took them a little longer to do that. That was the key to the whole game."

Slavtcheva and Shafer both had a team-high 16 points. Slavtcheva added nine rebounds.

The pair scored 16 of the first 20 Golden Panther points following halftime, including a Shafer three-pointer that tied the game at 49-49 with 10:37 left in the game and provided FIU with the lift that it needed to finish off a victory.

"I had a little opening and hit the shot," Shafer said.

Moody, who scored 14 points, grabbed 12 rebounds, and had five steals, used two free throws to tie the game again, less than a minute later and FIU never looked back as the Golden Panthers finished off the Blue Jays with a 22-7 run.

The Golden Panthers, who were forced into 18 turnovers in the first 30 minutes, limited themselves to one turnover for the final 10 minutes.

Cormisha Cotton had a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds.

Defensively, FIU held the nation's sixth best three-point shooting team and wide-open offense to 10 of 40 shooting from behind the arc and 26 percent from the field.

"[Creighton] spreads out like it's a golf course out there," Russo said. "It seemed like they were shooting from half court."
	
"I think we did a really nice job defensively. They did a nice job keeping us off the boards in the first half."

That changed in the second half when FIU, who entered the game fifth in the country in rebounding margin, continued the season long trend &#8211; this time by a 53-35 margin. FIU is also 23-1 when its opponent scores less than 69 points.

Both teams had their share of foul trouble. 

Creighton's leading scorer, Christy Neneman picked up two early fouls by the 18:31 mark. When she returned at 10:04 of the first half, Neneman sparked an 18-9 Blue Jay run.

FIU's starting point guard, Deniz Boz spent much of the second half on the bench with four fouls. In her absence, Anita Heller ran the offense. Heller finished with four points and four assists.

The win was FIU's first NCAA Tournament win in four years

Neneman and Laura Spanheimer led Creighton with 14 points each.

Sunday's opponent feature the nation's leading scorer and one of 20 finalists for the Naismith Award, which is given to the country's top player.

Headline: International Student Week held at BBC
Author: Vinora Murdock Hamilton / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The magic of Asia was unleashed on the Biscayne Bay Campus Panther Square last Thursday, as students from various cultures watched performances by the Chinese Dragon Dancers and the Echoes of Hawaii Polynesian Dancers. 

Thursday marked the closing of International Students Week; a four-day celebration designed to highlight the diversity of the students who attend the university. 

"We had a great turnout for all the events, which actually exceeded our expectations," International Student Scholars Service coordinator Anoush McNamee said.

On Monday students saw the movements of the Karimba African Dancers and the Seiruz Middle Eastern Belly Dancers. 

There was also an opportunity to learn about countries such as Egypt and Pakistan, as posters with a brief history of each area were placed around Panther Square. 

"It is very interesting to see things about other cultures," Japanese exchange student Aiko Hayashi said. 

The versatility of the International Sounds band was the talk of the day on Tuesday, as the players switched between reggae, soca, merengue, and salsa. 

The spirited music of the Caribbean and Latin America brought students to their feet. 

A panel discussion was held Wednesday for students to share information about their countries' history and people. 

Puerto Ricans had a chance to explain why they pronounce certain letters differently from other Spanish speaking countries. While the representative from Hong Kong explained that not all Oriental people are actually Chinese.

The European Sensation Musical Revue changed Valerie Desir's mind about Russian stereotypes. The group, comprising of four main dancers and seven children, performed with singing, dancing and juggling all at the same time. 

"These guys are really talented. Whenever I think Russian I think stiff, but [these dancers] are really loose," Desir said.

This is William Penn House and Penn House Productions' third year providing performances for the event.

"The participation of the students this year has been exceptional," Penn House said, "We have people doing stuff that they would not normally do." 

"This is something different and a whole lot of fun," said Chris Thorne who was crowned "King Teva," for his performance in the Polynesian Pupuli dance. 

The Pupuli dance was one of many taught to a group of brave souls who ventured on stage Thursday with their leis and grass skirts. 

 "We participate in socials both on and off campus, Asian Student Union president Beatriz Yu said, "This year's celebration has been better than the previous year, with more participation from other clubs."

Headline: FIU police to control Fair entrance
Author: Mario M. Sarria Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Miami-Dade County Fair, which runs from March 14 through March 31, features rides, food and exhibitions that draw many people to Tamiami Park every year. A popular attraction to many in Miami is also a popular parking and traffic headache for many students at FIU.

For the most part, students and faculty taking evening classes will feel the impact of the parking and traffic problems caused by the Fair.
Not only will FIU traffic get congested, but so will traffic along its main entrances. 

Traffic along 107th Ave. becomes congested during the fair's peak hours on the weekend, making Fair patrons use FIU entrances to get to the Fair grounds on Tamiami Park.

"The Youth Fair is something that happens every year. I don't know if they can do anything to make it better," Kyla Mencey Senior Health Services Administration said. "It took longer to get to class with people lost driving around campus."

Planning Ahead

FIU's parking and traffic operations during the Fair is an orderly process and is not chaotic, FIU Facilities Management Assistant Director Gregory Burdine-Coakley said.

"Members of the FIU Police Department meet with Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition [officials] to manage parking and traffic," Burdine-Coakley said. "To avoid getting mixed in with fair traffic students [should] use the 'north bound look system,'" Burdine-Coakley said. 

Burdine-Coakley said the north bound system will allow students to get anywhere on campus without mixing in with fair traffic by heading northbound on the traffic circle and driving on the north side of the campus instead of the south side, where the fair resides. 

In a university-wide memo, Police Chief Jesse Campbell wrote "Avoid mixing with fair traffic by utilizing lots one, eight, nine, 10 and 11."

Although following this recommendation will force students to park out of fair traffic congestion areas, this method renders the parking garages useless since they are accessible only via the traffic circle.

Students will find no other choice except to use the parking lots recommended if they want to avoid fair traffic altogether.

"Last year it was very congested fighting for parking," Mencey said.
Burdine-Coakley said the Miami-Dade County Fair will not create many more problems for students and faculty parking on campus.

"As the semester goes by, parking demand decreases," Coakley said.
 
FIU Police Captain Michael Wright said the university is anticipating parking and traffic problems.

"We are staffing officers in critical areas such as the traffic circle and the 16th St. main entrance," he said.

During traffic bottlenecks Wright said students and faculty should be patient.

"If students get stuck in a major gridlock, they can call Public Safety at 305-348-2626 for assistance," Wright said.

FIU Police Control Exits

In addition to the extra staffing, there will be officers available to assist students who live on campus, Wright said. Besides staffing officers on 107th Ave., University Police will have control of the 107th Ave. and 16 St. traffic light.

"We have control of the traffic light at 107th and 16 st to assist in getting students off campus," Wright said. 

That entrance will periodically close on the weekends.

"They need to [close the entrance] so that they don't use the campus until the need for parking is beyond what their parking lot allows," Wright said.

Students will not only compete with other students for parking but now they have to factor in fair goers as well.

Burdine-Coakley said the university does not follow up on its ticketing procedures while the Fair is in town because once the Fair's parking lots are used up, university parking lots and garages are opened to them.

"They use their lots first, then FIU's," Burdine-Coakley said.

In spite of the FIU no-ticketing policy Burdine-Coakley mentioned, Wright said illegally parked vehicles will be issued citations.

However, Burdine-Coakley said no tickets will be issued because "We wouldn't know who's who."

It is not clear who is right.

Reopening in April

One of the first casualties of the Fair was Parking Lot Five, which was shut down and given to the Fair March 4. Students, faculty and administrators will not have access to that lot until April 7. 

This affects many students like sophomore Lourdes Vazquez, who regularly parks in Parking Lot Five.

"Its worse for me since I always park in Lot Five," Vazquez, a finance major said. 

Burdine-Coakley said this happens because that parking lot is not completely on FIU grounds.

"Parking Lot Five is half on FIU property and half on Miami-Dade County property," Coakley said. "If we just built on our property, we'd only get 300 spaces." 

Burdine-Coakley said FIU has a 10-year agreement with the county concerning the use of the parking lot.

According to the agreement, FIU will build, maintain and use the lot for the majority of the year.

The Miami-Dade County Fair will use the lot for about one month out of the year as long as the agreement between the county and the university is in effect.

"The primary use of Lot Five is for fair staff and vendors who live in trailer homes and travel with the fair," Burdine-Coakley said. "Parking Lot Five is the only lot at FIU that is completely fenced in."

Headline: Government public relations staffers speak at FIU
Author: Neressa Joseph	/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Approximately 12 students gathered in the BBC library to get an overview of the public relations field from government public relations executives Tuesday.

Guest speakers included John Softness, from the office of Miami-Dade City Mayor Alex Penelas, Miami-Dade Office of Emergency Management Bill Delgrosso and City of Ft. Lauderdale Monique Damiano.

The panel discussion was one of a series brought by FIU's Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) every semester.

"We wanted to give students the opportunity to speak to professionals in the public relations field and ask them questions," FIU PRSSA public relations director Nazly de la Rosa said.

Students had an opportunity to ask five pre-selected questions, discussing essential steps and qualities needed to pursue a career in public relations field.

"There are two important things to be successful in public relations," Softness said, "you must know how to write and you must know about everything else that's going on around you."

Delgrosso explained how government public relations also use the media to get information about government to the public.

"You should build a relationship with the media," he said, "you have to use the media to your advantage to sell different government programs and ideas to the public." 

Damiano, an FIU graduate and PRSSA alumnus, shared her experience as a Public Information Specialist.

"You have to make sure the information given to the public is accurate," she said, "your credibility is very important so you should always proofread your work before you put it out to the public.  Once you put it out there, you can't get it back."

The panelists also talked about the Internet being an important tool in the field of public relations, since most government agencies have information available to the public via the web.

"The web is important in delivering information to the public," Delgrosso said.

	Delgrosso also emphasized that good planning by government is also required and becomes helpful in times of crisis.

	"The events of Sept. 11 demonstrated the importance of good planning by the government," he said.

Delgrosso explained that after the Emergency Operation Center, located in building seven of the World Trade Center collapsed, good planning by the government came into play.  They had to rebuild the EOC from scratch in the police academy.

"It was this planning that enabled the center activities operational within minutes," he said.

Speakers also told students to research organizations ahead of time and get to know professionals in the public relations field.

"You should start networking now; get to know professionals in the public relations field and build relationships with them," said Damiano.

This series of lectures and discussions have already covered sports and entertainment PR, and a lecture teaching students how to start a private PR firm. The next panel discussion will take place April 3, when students will get a chance to learn about non-profit public relations.

Headline: Slow "Machine" crawls forward in time
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
I was out with one of my friends, scouring a book store and chatting about anything and everything, and we got into a discussion about science fiction. "There has never been a good science fiction movie," he exclaimed, picking up some book with a red robot on the cover. "What Hollywood produces is action movies in disguise." I kind of agreed. Science fiction makes for really snazzy action sequences with "adjusted" rules in the realm of believability, thanks to phony-baloney techno-babble. Don't believe me: watch "Star Trek."

That said, "The Time Machine" looks like the cliché bit of sci-fi action cinema. Watching the commercial, I thought I was seeing the latest incarnation of popcorn movies about time travel. It seemed as shiny and glossy as the fancy machine that Guy Pearce travels with in the movie. So I was a bit shocked when the first action sequence in the entire movie didn't take place until almost an hour of movie.

The story is about professor Alexander Hartdegen (Pearce), who loses his fiancé in a mugging just moments after proposing to her. The tragic event sends him to design the title machine, so he can go back into the past and save her from ever getting killed. Of course, he saves her from one death only to watch her die in another tragic accident. He can't seem to change the past from happening, and he wants to know why. So he decides there's only one place he can find the solution: the future.

He overdoes it and finds himself in a world inhabited by the Eloi, a peaceful people who live in fear of muscular creatures called Morlocks. If you've ever seen the old movie with the guy who played Wilbur from Mr. Ed as the best friend, you know the story from here. As mentioned earlier, the action in this movie doesn't kick up until approximately an hour into the film. After he tries to save her again. After he goes into the future and goes too far. After he meets an attractive Eloi that can speak English, Mara (Samantha Mumba). 

The action sequence, a big battle sequence with the Morlocks attacking the Eloi, is pretty average by most movie standards. Fun, sure. But after an hour, you start to realize: This movie isn't really an action movie, is it?

And it's not. The only other action sequences are a mano-a-mano with Jeremy Irons, who, for his 10 minutes of screen time, at least has enough cool lines to make use of his voice. Where most science fiction movies are action flicks, "The Time Machine" is more like a hopped up period drama mixed with special effects. No, it's more like a short adventure film across time and without much adventure. Shoot, that isn't right either. "The Time Machine" is, well, a slow moving science fiction story with a bit of romance thrown in. 

Mumba does a decent job of looking around like she's scared and reciting her dialogue in a way that sounds better than the tin acting of some singers. Irons is basically Irons. It's hard for him to screw up a role, and when he does, you can almost always blame it on the script. 
Pearce does an admirable job as Alexander, but I'm quickly becoming tired of watching him as the forlorn leading man pining over one woman when he's got another right in front of him. Plus, he has this weird smirk that crosses his face as the most inappropriately serious moments that seem as if completely unintentional. I saw them in "Memento," and I'm seeing them here, and it's really bothering me. 

At least I can say better of director Simon Wells. Considering the guy's only done "Balto" and "An American Tail II," the film looks great. Animation directors always seem to do well at live-action stuff, since they know more about what's visually appealing and angles than regular directors do sometimes . But structure-wise, the flick reminds me of Disney's recent "Atlantis: The Lost Continent." It's slowly reaching the ending as a major payoff that doesn't work as well as it should for such a build.

The question remains: Is "The Time Machine," well, worth your time? I personally dug it as something different. Just because it's slower than most films doesn't necessarily make it a bad one. If you accept that the movie is more intent on focusing on actual science than on Alexander vs. the Morlocks, you'll be able to enjoy the movie's vibe. If anything, I know my friend will enjoy the heck out of it only to step out of the theater and complain that Hollywood's released "another one." Yes, they have, friend. But they're getting better.

Headline: Second "Moulin Rouge" CD follows original's footsteps
Author: Rebecca Martin
&nbsp;
When I think of "Moulin Rouge," I think of technology. And sex. Women think about sex, too. Within the movie, we have an updated version of Patti LaBelle's "Lady Marmalade" (sexy), Madonna's "Like A Virgin" (ok, not so sexy, but incredibly funny) and Elton John's "Your Song" (Ewan MacGregor makes everything sexy).
 
I've only seen the bootleg version of "Moulin Rouge" on my roommate's computer, and I never owned the first soundtrack, but I've heard all the songs thanks to Morpheus and WinMX. Now that I've acquired the inevitable second soundtrack to "Moulin Rouge" through the same medium, the appropriateness of my acquisitions coincides with the obvious technological intentions of Baz Luhrman. His musical was brilliant. The first soundtrack to Luhrman's innovation was also memorable, lacking only songs such as "Spectacular, Spectacular" and "Like A Virgin." As for the second soundtrack, well, at least it includes these songs.

I love "Your Song" as I'm sure everyone who has seen "Moulin Rouge" does. Putting it on the soundtrack was a marketable decision. Putting it on the second soundtrack, twice, was not.  Yes, twice. There are three versions of  Elton John's "Your Song" floating in cyberspace. Music downloaders, beware – I had to download this song, no joke, thirty two times to find the right one(s). After so much time wasted on downloading, folks, do not, I REPEAT, do NOT move when listening to this song. Do not even blink. You will miss the difference between the versions, and thus hours upon hours of your time will be gone to no avail.

The signature song of "Moulin Rouge" ("Come What May"), Nicole Kidman's entrance ( "Sparkling Diamonds") and her damsel-in-distress song, ("One Day I'll Fly Away") are also included, again, on "Moulin Rouge II." I'm downloading these songs, thinking, there must be variations between all these tracks. 

Surely, the music executives aren't mean enough to make me download song upon song without some sort of noticeable difference.  I'm not going to hide it from you. I was disappointed. Practically the same versions of all these songs are on the first soundtrack. Why should anyone bother with the second soundtrack? Why should we endorse the very people who have wasted our precious downloading time? Four very good reasons. 

One: "The Pitch (Spectacular, Spectacular)." Compared to other musicals, the songs that are meant to pass as reality and entice the audience into the insanity of people dancing and singing have nothing on "Spectacular, Spectacular." If you can remember, all the characters in the movie are trying to protect their special interests. They are united to persuade The Duke for financial aid amidst a chaos of costumes, props and settings. 

The excitement and dire quality of the delivery to The Duke is still electric on the soundtrack. The song is pure insanity and tries to be nothing else. 

 Two: "Like A Virgin." Madonna's lyrics never received more laughter than when placed in context of this film. Again, The Duke is being deceived. This time, however, he sings and dances with random people. Even on the soundtrack, when The Duke sings "Feels so good inside," you really can't help but smile.  The brilliance and hilarity of the song are enough of a reason to get this soundtrack, but hold up. I have two more reasons.

Three (And possibly the best reason): "Meet Me in the Red Room." Speaking of sex and technology, this song is the perfect combination of the two. (And up to this point, you thought it was the Internet.) 
I was very impressed by this song and I couldn't remember it from the movie, I actually watched "Moulin Rouge" again to see where the song comes in. Nicole Kidman is luring men in for the diamonds she wants. Her sex appeal is at its highest in "Meet Me in the Red Room," and of course, the general dance genre that the song falls under makes it the best on the soundtrack.

Four (pay special attention to this one): I feel guilty for endorsing free music and movies and stealing some poor music executive's secretary's salary. So, if you buy this soundtrack, my karma will be restored and I can go back to listening to "Moulin Rouge II" with a clear mind.

Seriously, do yourself a favor and listen to the second soundtrack to the original musical. There are repeats, but you will find yourself listening to them. Hilarity, creative freedom, sex appeal and innovative technology: it's worth the $14.95.

Headline: "Dance Dance Dance" breaks away from tradition
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
FIU's "Dance Dance Dance 2002" was an interesting sight to behold and far from traditional. In fact, at times it was even hard to discern how the movements on stage related to dancing. Primarily the show consisted of cultural dancing, such as African and Hispanic, and this could be a reason for the show seeming so edgy. You see, with a title like "Dance Dance Dance," spectators go in with the mindset of Broadway tap dancing and "Swan Lake" Ballet Suites. 

What they don't expect is to see these traditional dance genres distorted into extremely modern pieces. The show did not prepare the audience for what it was about to observe. Some people may say this is a good thing, but one has to be in the mood for the quirky and bizarre. 
All of this does not mean that the dancers were incompetent; in fact it was quite the contrary. The positions and rhythms and poses that the performers had to display were simply remarkable.

The first piece was entitled "Re-Arrangements." It was a cute little tap segment, but nothing too spectacular. The snag was the theme and how it fit in with the dancing that was going on. "Re-Arrangements" consisted of some great tap sections, sectioned off several times by periods of pacing or marching, while the sound system played a recording of the dancers giving their definition of "home."  Despite its oddities, this was one of the best segments of the production. 
  
Next came "Stations." This was the most bizarre segment of the whole show. It was, presumably, an interpretive dance for which there was no interpretation – or at least none that the audience could decipher. Lots of different theories were offered by audience members during intermission. Among them was that the dancers were aliens, that they were birds or that they were lost in the woods.  

Concluding Act One was "Amala," an Afro-Cuban Cultural dance. It was the story of a human's affair with a goddess and the reciprocations it entailed. The costumes were colorful and vivid and the dancing was very passionate.

Act Two began with "City of Dreams," which was another highlight of the show.  The piece itself was broken up into 5 scenes, each focusing on a different aspect of "golden theatre." It had some delightful moments and the dancing was nice as well, even though it took ballet to a whole new meaning. 

Second to last came "Los Caracoles" – another highpoint. This piece was a fantastic display of the ancient Spanish traditional Flamenco dance. This piece had the highest energy level out of all acts, and at the end, it was a struggle not to shout "Ole." 

Concluding this two and a half hour production was "Oh My! Oh My Goodness!" The rest of the number was full-out vulgarity. It was not so much the male narrator dressed as a woman  it was the content of the dance, if it can be called that. The only way to relate this piece to dancing is if it were filed under "strip tease." It was just too much. All that can be said about the show is "Oh my goodness!"

Headline: "We Were Soldiers" displays heroism during 'Nam
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
When all the fighting is over and there is no more blood to be shed, there is silence, as illustrated in the film "We Were Soldiers." The movie is based on a real incident that took place during the first and most gruesome combat of the Vietnam War, Ia Drang Valley, when the U.S. army encountered the North Vietnamese in November 1965. 
 
Before actually going to Vietnam, we get to know some of the soldiers and their families. For starters, we are introduced to the leader of the U.S. 7th Air Calvary, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, (Mel Gibson), as well as a young soldier whom Gibson becomes close with, (Chris Klein).  
Director Randall Wallace wisely focuses on a few individual soldiers and their lives and from those few we are able to generalize about many of the others. In this way, they aren't just stereotypes: they are living, breathing human beings. 

 Since we become familiar with the characters and realize that the events in the story actually occurred, it is rather unpleasant to see their heads blown off or to see their bodies burn inch by inch. We understand that not only do those individuals have wives and children at home waiting for their return, but we also realize that they are brothers-in-arms, fighting for each other's lives. 

Sadly enough, in this battle alone, 200 out of the 450 American troopers never made it home, although with the amount of bloodshed, it seems like a whole lot more than 200. 

So not only is this a movie about patriotism, but it is also a film about heroism. Wallace successfully intertwines the two, by praising those soldiers, both dead and alive.
 
The film does not only focus on this during the graphic scenes of the battlefield, but throughout the story, Wallace devotes ample time giving tribute where tribute is due. 

This movie is not completely about the good guys versus the bad guys. We most naturally side with the Americans, but we come to understand that the soldiers of the enemy have families too. The closest we get is a Vietnamese soldier writing in his journal, where he keeps a photograph of his beautiful wife. 

That soldier is later killed and the journal is sent to his wife. At the end, the camera briefly focuses on her crying as she opens the journal, which is sufficient for us to realize that although her husband was the enemy, pain and sorrow are identical for both friend and foe. At that point, it isn't about good and evil. It's about love and loss of life.

We are forced to change our viewpoint and to recognize that these men, just like the American men, are equally patriotic. Just like the American soldiers, they were protecting their land and their fellow combatants.
 Although the film is successful in accomplishing its goal of praising patriotism and bravery, some of the lines are slightly clichéd, in order to increase drama and to clearly evoke emotion. We hear lines such as, "I'm glad I could die for my country,"  and "tell my wife I love her," uttered by a dying soldier. Of course, after hearing these lines the audience's only choice is to cry.

Despite the heavy content of the film, we meet the second-in-command, Plumpley (Sam Elliot), who somewhat lightens the film with his humor. In such a film, it is tricky to integrate wit, for the mood is anything but humorous, but Wallace successfully does so without making a mockery of the situation. 

All in all, the film brilliantly reenacts recent history by frankly presenting the grim details of that combat. And the message becomes clear at the end of the film when reporters arrive to get the full story. They approach another reporter who had been in Vietnam to observe it all, and then they question Gibson. Neither the reporter nor Gibson is able say a word. 
In the next scene, that same reporter admits to Gibson that he does not know what to say about the battle. A tearful Gibson responds: "Write about what these men did out there on the battlefield. Tell everyone about their courage and might."
 
The message is obvious: It is not acceptable to silence ourselves. Silencing only perpetuates the forgetting of each individual hero, those who made it out alive as well as those who never made it home.

Headline: Alumni Arroyo signs with NBA's Nuggets
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Carlos Arroyo, a former FIU guard, signed a 10-day contract with the Denver Nuggets last Thursday, returning to the NBA for the second time this season. 

Arroyo debuted Thursday with one assist and two points in six minutes in a 104-93 win versus the New York Knicks. He also played Saturday in the 109-106 overtime win versus the Portland Trailblazers.

Arroyo, who was released by the Toronto Raptors in January, had been playing in Spain with Tau Ceramica on a one-month contract. There he scored 29 points and had seven assists in three Euroleague games.
With the Raptors, Arroyo played 17 games, scoring 30 points and 21 
assists.

The Nuggets (19-40) made a trade a week earlier, acquiring Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway and Donnell Harvey, Dallas' 2002 first-round draft choice and cash from the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Nick Van Exel, Raef LaFrentz, Avery Johnson and  Tariq Abdul-Wahad. Arroyo will be Hardaway's backup.

"It'll be interesting. He'll be playing behind Hardaway," FIU head coach Donnie Marsh said. "If he does a good job, he could keep himself on the roster like Raja [Bell, a former FIU guard who signed with the Philadelphia 76ers after two 10-day contracts]."

Nugget rookie guard Kenny Satterfield has been injured. Arroyo will compete with him for a spot on the roster, allowing George McCloud to return to his more natural position of forward.

"Spain was a good experience but I was not happy with the playing time. In any case, I think that they were satisfied with my work because they asked to see if I could remain with the team a few more days," Arroyo told the Puerto Rican press.

Arroyo will have a chance to play at home, when the Nuggets travel to the Miami Heat this Saturday. That day also marks the last day of the 10-day contract.

Headline: Penn State sends women's basketball out of tournament
Subheadline: Defensive breakdown, Mazzante ends winning streak at 13
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The ride, the season and the streak are over now thanks to the nation's leading scorer, Kelly Mazzante and the Penn State Lady Lions 96-79 win in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

In front of an electrified crowd of 6968 at the Bryce Jordan Center in State College, PA, Mazzante's 32 points and the Golden Panther's worst defensive showing of the year was enough to end FIU's 13 game wining streak and send the No. 24 ranked team home.

Penn State took control of the game early, using a 21-7 run to open up a 32-15 lead with 9:34 left in the first half.

FIU (27-6) made runs throughout the remainder of the game and shrunk the deficit to single digits on two different occasions. 

"We played discipline basketball. We didn't get down when they came back on us," Penn State head coach Rene Portland said.

Two Gergana Slavtcheva free throws with 6:03 left in the first half, brought FIU within eight points and made Slavtcheva the third all-time leading scorer in the program's history. Slavtcheva passed assistant coach Andrea Nagy.

Eight minutes after halftime, FIU cut a 17 point Penn State lead to nine when Heller converted a steal into a fast break layout. 

Heller was the catalyst for the Golden Panther runs, scoring 16 points, with three steals.

FIU would not come any closer thanks to Mazzante and host Lady Lions (23-11) closed out the game on a 28-20 run.

Two Mazzante three-pointers damaged the Golden Panthers hopes. Penn State would later increase its lead to a game-high 21 points when Tanisha Wright put back a rebound for two of her 26 points.

"[Mazzante] was shooting from everywhere," Golden Panther center Cormisha Cotton said. "Every time we tried to come back, she put a dagger in our heart."

Mazzante converted six of 11 three-pointers. 

"She really is in a world of her own sometimes," Portland said. "And I just kind of leave her alone."

Cormisha Cotton was a bright spot for FIU, scoring 20 points and grabbing six rebounds.

Seniors Slavtcheva and Cheryl Moody finished their Golden Panther careers with 28 combined points. Karen Roxborough also finished her collegiate career.

"This is not a time of the year that any coach likes &#8211; to have to say goodbye to seniors," FIU head coach Cindy Russo said.

"We have just wonderful memories of this team. We've had an exciting, wonderful year."

Penn State shot 56 percent from the field and 53 percent from behind the three-point range.

"Most of the time, we were four players playing good defense and one girl broke down," Russo said. "Four players were playing good defense and one wasn't doing her job. That was tonight for us."

The loss was only the second when FIU scores over 70 points. The Golden Panthers are 23-2 when scoring over 70.

FIU ends the season as Sun Belt Conference Champions and reached the round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. Before losing to Penn State, the Golden Panthers had won 17 of 18 games.

"This was definitely not the FIU team that won the Sun Belt Conference," Russo said.

Moody's 14 point night made her the 14th FIU player to reach 1,000 points. Mandy Shafer recorded nine rebounds to go with her eight points and Silvia Mesa scored seven.

Penn State's Jess Strom finished with 14 assists, placing her eighth in NCAA Tournament history.

Headline: COMMENTARY One word to describe this season: Dominating
Subheadline: Commentary on women's basketball
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Dominating.

Is there any other way to describe the women's basketball team's season? FIU (26-5), who holds the nation's 10th best winning percentage, went through this season and made it look almost easy.

Dominating is outscoring your opponents by 419 points over the course of a season, which is an average of over 13 points per game. The scoring margin ranks FIU 13th in the country.

Dominating is going 26-5 and losing one Sun Belt Conference game.

Dominating is holding a current 12 game winning streak and winning 17 of the past 18 games.

Dominating is having Cheryl Moody record 21 double-doubles. 

Dominating is four players averaging in double-digits scoring.

Dominating is out-rebounding opponents by an average of 11.6 per game, ranking 5th in the country, and Moody ranking seventh in the nation with 11.7 boards per game.

Dominating is the fact that the above rankings are not conference marks &#8211; but national standings.

Dominating is going 13-2 at home, despite an average crowd of only 391.

Dominating is having Gergana Slavtcheva leading the team with 16.7 points per game and only being the second most valuable player on the team.

Dominating is being so deep that Karen Roxborough, who played 37 minutes during the regular season, can come into the tournament and contribute 17 points in 30 quality minutes. 

It took the necessary writers and coaches &#8211; the individuals who vote in the Associated Press poll and USA/Today Coaches Poll &#8211; a while to figure this team out. FIU didn't break into the top-25 until the week of the conference tournament. But it didn't takethe Golden Panthers' opponents nearly as long.

The Golden Panthers played some quality teams this year. Don't let the scores completely fool you. North Texas and Denver, the two latest victims of the Golden Panthers, are pretty good. 

North Texas won 12 of 13 games before falling to FIU in the conference finals. Denver, despite an off year, finished 16-13 and took a six game winning streak into the semifinal against FIU.

In the end though, FIU went through the conference tournament making these quality teams look like high school players, outscoring North Texas, Denver and New Mexico State by a combined 239-171.

FIU now takes this domination and the program's first ever SBC title into the Big Dance, where they hope to show the country what the Sun Belt has already found out.

On senior night, Slavtcheva said that she didn't feel any finality because she had "much more" to accomplish.

She couldn't have been more right. 

Then again, maybe there is still more to come.
