Headline: Scripps Day: Editors, CEOs to give in-class presentations
Author: Elvis Ramirez / BBC Life Editor
&nbsp;
The Scripps Howard Foundation will be hosting "Scripps Day," a daylong event where students can interact with different journalism professionals, at the Biscayne Bay Campus Oct. 3. At the event, journalism students can have their resumes critiqued, take part in lectures given by editors, directors and CEOs from the E.W. Scripps Company and end the day by sitting in on a speech by Ken Lowe,  president and CEO of the E.W. Scripps Company. 

The company is the publisher of newspapers and owner of broadcast stations under the Scripps Howard Foundation.

Lowe managed several cable networks: HGTV, Food Network, Fine Living and Do It Yourself. His speech will be on the topic of the news media in the digital age.

Though it's not likely students will get a job at the event, it's still possible, said David Berry, marketing director for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

The event's focus is on networking and learning about journalism rather than job placement. Professionals from Scripps owned television stations and newspapers, will give lectures in different journalism classes throughout the day; there will be a total of 25 guest speakers.  The lectures are open to the general public. 

"It's a fun event for anyone interested, not just students," Berry said.

Holding the lectures in class guarantees an audience, said Jane Daugherty, an associate professor in the SJMC.

"One of the difficulties that we always have here and that you have at any university that has a large commuter population is getting people together," Daugherty said. "And that [holding the lectures in classrooms during class times] assures that we make a connection not just with people who are interested but with people who are journalism students."

The schedule of lectures places the guest speakers in classes that are relevant to their area of expertise.

"There is someone coming to my law and ethics class who's got experience dealing with ethical issues and dilemmas that newspapers face," Daugherty said. "And that kind of real world speaker is a big plus for the students."

The Scripps Howard Foundation took interest in the University two years ago because they wanted to increase diversity in their newsrooms and FIU graduates the highest number of Hispanic journalists in the country, according to Allan Richards, chair of the SJMC and assistant professor. Judith Clabes, the president of the foundation visited the University to confirm that the school offered what the foundation sought.

The foundation is interested in hiring reporters that are part of  the minority communities, and the University's student population is 69 percent Hispanic and 11 percent [black], Richards said.

Two students were awarded scholarship-internships by the Scripps Howard Foundation: Joselle Galis-Mendez and Gretel Sarmiento. The University was then made a partnership school, which allows the foundation to become more involved with the SJMC.

The foundation donated $150,000 to the SJMC over a three-year period at $50,000 per year. The journalism school used the grant to build the new writing center located in Academic II room 303.

The event is an opportunity for students to network. 

"It's one thing learning in the classroom, that's fine, that's in a vacuum, but you also need to meet the people who run these businesses … Being good and being smart is not enough."

Professors think this is a great opportunity for students who view journalism as their career.

"I've worked in newspapers for 30 years … I don't think I was ever hired without having a connection with somebody at the paper," Daugherty said.

"The Scripps Howard Foundation isn't coming to walk our halls, they want our students to end up working for them," Richards said.

Headline: Club promotes religious harmony
Author: Patricia Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As president of the Faith Matters club, Sasha Maghimi-Kian stresses the importance of peace and nonviolence, especially because she grew up in a multicultural environment.

"My father came here from Iran and my mother came here from Chile," said Maghimi-Kian, a double major in anthropology and international relations.

"In school people would say horrible things to you. After the hostage crisis in Iran, I remember that certain parents didn't want their kids to come to my house to play with me because I had an Iranian father."

The Faith Matters club's mission is to inform and encourage socialization among students of different faiths.

"The world is a much smaller place than what we make it out to be. It's very easy to understand that we're all the same ... Where we're from, and what religion we follow shouldn't separate us," Maghimi-Kian said.

The  Rev. Linnea Pearson, a religious studies professor and the club's advisor, formed the club during the Spring semester to bring students together to discuss religion and its social, cultural, economic, environmental and political influences.

"I want to bring people together of different faith perspectives ... and have them interact with one another so we can learn from one another, and share our faith with one another, because whatever we have faith in, whatever we believe in shapes our whole lives," said Pearson, who preaches at the Unitarian Universalist Church.

For the past few months,  club members have been planning events to promote the club and its message.

They put together a Candlelight Vigil for Peace in observance of the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq on March 14, 2007. 

Ayeshia Ahmed, the club's vice president, was touched by the vigil.

"I remember how we went around the circle of guests present for the vigil commemorating the war in Iraq, and asked them why they were there. Everyone responded differently ... I was present because I believe that there can be peace in the Middle East. I feel like I'm really doing my part to make peace in the world," said Ahmed, an international business major.

The club also held the "Night of Remembrance" event, which consisted of a nondenominational prayer  to remember the sixth anniversary of September 11.

"Faith Matters is pro-peace, and pro-nonviolence. We want to bring people together for common causes," Maghimi-Kian said.

The club gets together for "Sundays at Seven" on the second Sunday of every month. The event features group discussion, music, films and readings from different traditions.

To celebrate the Winter Solstice, the club will host the "World Festival of Lights"  on Dec. 9 at the Mary Ann Wolfe Theater at the Biscayne Bay Campus. The event will commemorate all religious festivities in the winter.

Members are welcoming to people of all faiths.

"Peace is not found by looking for differences, but with open hearts and minds searching out connections and that is what Faith Matters is all about," Maghimi-Kian said.

Headline: Preventing the common cold
Author: Shannon Fallon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The average adult is estimated to catch at least three colds per year, and if you deal with children, your odds of getting sick double, according to the American Medical Society. 

Itchy eyes, a scratchy throat and a stuffy nose are all symptons of the common cold, and being sick can be detrimental to students' lives. 

With especially hectic non-stop schedules packed with classes and work, some students can't afford to miss out on one lecture, quiz or even one day on the job. 

Although there is no known cure for the cold, here are some ways that students are trying to make it a little less common and a little more bearable.



Keep it Simple



Carly Gallo, a sophomore and current cold victim, is a first hand witness to the agonizing effects of being sick. Staying up late has taken a toll on her immune system but following a rigid diet of fluids when sick has helped her combat the sniffles.

"I eat, live and breathe architecture," Gallo said. "I spend countless nights building models and drawing up plans. 

The workload takes a serious toll on my body and my health, making me really vulnerable to colds. [When I'm sick] I live off of orange juice and water, Airborne cold medication and only eat soups. It seems to work for me."  



Run for your Health



For other students such as junior Leonard Chu-hung, keeping active seems to work for getting over the cold as soon as possible.

Chu-Hung works 40 hours a week as a retail manager, is married and a full-time student - and he doesn't believe in resting when he's sick. 

"I live in those freezing cold computer labs so when I get sick I head straight on over to the [the Recreation Center] and sweat the cold right out of my system by running a couple of miles," he said. "I can't afford to miss a minute out of my day." 



Be A Beach Bum



Jessica Olivera, a senior, takes a more leisure approach in nursing herself back to health. 

She believes the beach is the perfect place to relieve her cold symptoms because of its soothing and natural effects on the body. 

"If I know I have nothing really important to do, I take the day off, grab a beach chair and blanket and head to the beach," Olivera said. "I fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean, get a tan and fresh air all in one shot. Plus, the salt water is great for sore throats."

  

Slow Like Honey



Another remedy for the dreaded sore throat is honey, which senior Tina Adeoba uses. 

Adeoba hates when she starts to cough and can't seem to stop, especially when the coughing attack starts in the middle of class or when dealing with a customer at work.

"I carry honey with me when I'm sick and coughing," she said. "As soon as I start coughing I eat a spoon full of honey and it calms my throat down. Not to mention it taste good too." 



Prevention



While some people start using remedies after they catch a cold, others such as Ashley Fernald take a more proactive approach. 

Fernald, a sophomore, loathes the idea of being sick and hates seeing others sick. 

To decrease her chances of contact with germs, she wipes down her desk at the beginning of each class with a disinfecting wipe. 

The only way to catch a cold is via direct contact with the virus, so preventive measures such as this might be your best bet if you want to avoid having a sick day altogether.

Headline: The Meaning of Life...a column looking for the answers: King and Queen bow to autism
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Viviana Reyes didn't read much when she was young, but she knew enough about fairy tales to suspect her life was about to become one when she met Eduardo Reinas.Reyes and Reinas - "Kings" and "Queens" in Spanish.

They were both children of stubborn working class parents in Montevideo, Uruguay. She was practical, enjoyed the occasional nights out on the town and dreamed of a life away from her family; he was a shy soccer player, prone to flights of fancy but always a hard worker.

Neither of them had reached their 20th birthday when they married at the start of the millennium. They moved to the United States a year later.

"Our family, our friends, the TV, they all said things were going to be different there," Viviana - now Reinas - said. "We knew it wasn't going to be perfect, but we had to try it out."

And it was perfect. Eduardo found a steady job, Viviana realized how much she missed her parents and saved enough money to bring them over, and they all lived together in a small but cozy apartment as a happy, loving family.

Viviana doesn't like to tell herself that that's when the fairy tale ended because it makes her feel like a bad mother.

Her first baby boy was born in a Broward hospital soon after her parents arrived. He was given a very American sounding name to celebrate the family's love for their new country, but Viviana asked that I not use it in this column.

The kid was a typical baby: puffy cheeks, a contagious giggle, a grinding cry. The parents didn't notice anything was different with him until the toddler years. 

He didn't smile much by the time he reached his first birthday. 

By his second year he made loud grunting noises that attracted the attention of passer bys. By his third and then fourth, he muttered gibberish instead of coherent words, yelled at inappropriate times and threw himself against walls.

"Our friends thought we were joking when we called him a little monster. We were serious," Viviana said.

Eduardo had to apologize to the doctor after Viviana abruptly left the room and locked herself in the car. The man had just finished telling the couple that one out of every 150 children born in the U.S. develop a form of autism, a developmental disorder. 

Their baby son was that one child.

Viviana left the boy with her parents the day I interviewed her, but I could tell she had just spent a day with her son from the crow's feet around her eyes and the tired, half-hearted laughs she used throughout our meeting.

"I can never leave him alone because I'm afraid he'll hurt himself or others. I love him so much, I love to hold him, I love it when he's quiet and he hugs me back," Viviana said, stopping in mid-sentence to decide whether she was going to continue or not. "I just didn't think it was going to be this way."

Eduardo works longer hours now because Viviana is pregnant again, but the young wife is forced to suppress the idea that he may stay at his job to avoid dealing with the difficult infant. 

She hasn't confronted him about this and doesn't plan to because another question haunts her even more: can the same thing happen to the new baby?

This thought often makes her clutch her swollen belly and cry.

At her wedding, her sisters gave her a plastic tiara because she was becoming a reina, perhaps by name only, but still a queen. 

Viviana doesn't feel so regal anymore. She left the tiara in Uruguay and doesn't know what her cousin did with it.

"Everything was just a tale I told myself," she said. "Maybe things will be better, maybe they won't. I love him so much, and maybe I sound like I'm making it up because I'm saying it a lot, but it's true, I couldn't live without him."

And Viviana reaches down and unconsciously grabs at her swollen belly.

Headline: Resident assistants maintain order
Author: Ron Matthew / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is 19-year-old Eduardo Rodriguez's first night on duty. He has just received word of a party happening in one of the rooms of University Park Towers. Aware of the fact that he's in a building full of residents mostly older, bigger and stronger than him, Rodriguez can't help but be apprehensive. He calls a much older partner to back him up. 

Despite the gravity of the situation, his partner breaks it up with ease. What may sound like an episode of "Cops" is actually indicative of one of the many realities faced by the RAs of FIU. 

An RA is a trained student leader in colleges and universities charged with the responsibility of living with and supervising as many as 40 to 75 students in a residential hall. For many student residents, RAs can provide mediation on commonly faced issues such as roommate conflicts and depression.

"Being an RA is what you make of it," said Ron Thompson, assistant director of residential life. 

Programming is one unique aspect of RA duties; where they tap into creativity to put on events or activities to promote a sense of community among the residents. 

Teresa Ronquillo, a senior and current president of Delta Epsilon Iota Honor Society, exemplifies this in her second year on the job.

"I feel like a big responsible ball of cheesy energy and so my role as an RA lets me funnel that into something that can have a positive outcome on me and others," she said. 

Her favorite program, "Going up?," encourages environmental awareness. The program is conducted in an elevator, where, as soon as people enter, they are  asked if they are going up, and when the resply is "yes" the RA responds with: "And so are the amounts of CO2 molecules in our earth's atmosphere," followed by a fact about the environment.    

But with great perks come great responsibilities. Though the RA job allows for one to be involved on campus and extracurricular activities, the nature of the job might require going beyond the call of duty. Steven Blanc, a second-year RA, heavily felt the demands of the job during his first year; he checked residents out of the hallways."Between finals and checkout, I went two weeks on an average of two hours of sleep per night," he said.   

In spite of the challenges, RAs including Rodriguez agree that they respect and appreciate the job because it breeds confidence. 

As Rodriguez reflects on the party incident four years ago, he realizes that the job had a profound impact on him. 

 "I wanted to be someone who could face a situation like that and handle it with confidence." Rodriguez said.

Thompson, who was also an RA, shares that sentiment."I wasn't even on duty - I was simply hanging out in a friend's room when I detected a domestic violence situation and saw the entire situation play itself out. 

As profound of an experience as that was, it is but one of a thousand I eventually dealt with working the [RA] job - one of [many] that led me to be more capable and confident than ever before."

Headline: Review: Across the Universe (Movie)
Subheadline: Beatles musical lacks substance
Author: Reinier Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There are few things in pop culture more revered than the music of The Beatles. 

As such, a musical incorporating their songs would have the daunting task of satisfying not only casual movie-goers, but earning the respect of die-hard Beatles fans alike. 

Across the Universe successfully does both with its style, but gives up substance in the process.

Set in the 1960s, the film revolves around the romance of Jude, an English dock worker and Lucy, an American teenager. 

If those names sound familiar, they should. 

Every important character in the movie is named after various characters from Beatles songs; and it's touches like these that will have fans smirking and waiting for the next reference. 

The problem is that allusions alone aren't enough to carry a story. 

Jude and Lucy's love-story is shallow and feels like an afterthought that only serves as a way to showcase the music. 

There are several scenes and characters that could have been omitted without affecting the plot, and that would have given the film some much needed space to flesh out the story. 

Some segments felt like they would make great music videos but contribute nothing to furthering the story.

Where the plot falls short, the musical performances shine. 

More than 30 Beatles songs appear in the film, performed by the actors themselves, right on set. 

Classics like "Hey Jude," "Revolution" and the climactic "All You Need is Love" are incorporated flawlessly and tell the story much better than any of the dialogue could hope to. 

It also helps that the actors can actually sing and can do the songs justice. 

Even some of The Beatles more forgettable songs such as "Hold Me Tight" are used to great effect and really convey the sense of fun and optimism of the 1960s. 

The visual effects are another triumph. Colors are vibrant, as they should be for a film set in the '60s, and the psychedelic scenes in particular are stunning. 

One has to imagine that what they're seeing is as close to experiencing a real acid trip as it gets, without the actual drugs. 

And in the end, if you go in with the proper mindset and can appreciate the vibrant visuals as well as the timeless music, Across the Universe won't let you down.

Headline: Review: Motion City Soundtrack - Even If It Kills Me (Music)
Subheadline: Band's influences seen in new album
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Being considered one of the best bands in pop-punk is either a great thing or an awful thing, depending on how seriously you take pop music. 

It is one of those labels that has always bothered bands that are trying to be taken more seriously by their fans.

Fortunately, Motion City Soundtrack seem perfectly unable to take anything seriously, which is what makes the band's music so refreshing, especially on the third studio release Even If It Kills Me, released Sept. 18 on Epitath Records.

This is most evident on tracks such as "The Future Freaks Me Out" from the debut album and "It Had To Be You" from the new album.

"It Had To Be You" begins as a forlorn monologue about lost love, but then, following a power-pop chorus complete with "woohoos," transforms into a completely silly description of lead singer and lyricist Justin Pierre's perfect date of getting "wrecked on pop tarts and sex" and "fighting crime with mangos and limes."

The band's influences are audible in the album; from the swirling and surging synths that recall The Cars to self deprecating, pop culture influenced lyrics that make one think of early Weezer to the huge Cheap Trick-esque choruses, Motion City Soundtrack has been able to create a distinct sound that is instantly recognizable.

It is perhaps fitting that Cars' front man Ric Ocasek, who produced Weezer's first album, has taken the helm for some of the production of this album; splitting duties with Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Eli Janney of Girls Against Boys. 

His influences can be heard all over Motion City's sound so it was inevitable that they would team up in some way.

While the band has had success with a familiar formula in the past, they've also branched out on this album. "The Conversation" is a plaintive piano ballad that's stripped down, piano and vocals mix sounds more like Ben Folds Five than Weezer.

In fact there are times when the band has more success shunning its formula than following it. 

Lead single "Broken Heart" sounds like an inferior version of the hit from the last album "Everything Is Alright."

That's not to say the band should shun its formula completely. 

Motion City haven't lost the ability to write a great pop song. "This Is For Real" might just be the catchiest song the band has every written, and since they have released it as the second single, it could be the one to push the band all the way into the mainstream, where they could join fellow Warped Tour veterans Fall Out Boy and Gym Class Heroes at the top of the charts.

Don't be surprised to see Motion City Soundtrack making its push into the ears of mainstream pop fans before long.

Headline: Review: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core (Game)
Subheadline: Fighting game grows up, characters bring variety
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The two-dimensional fighting game might be becoming a lost art in an age of advanced three-dimensional imagery, but the classics like Street Fighter and King of Fighters still have the staying power that many games lack today. 

The Guilty Gear series shares in this legacy while taking a different path compared to its contemporaries.  

With its unorthodox characters and style, Guilty Gear has gone strong for nearly a decade since its beginnings on the original Sony PlayStation. 

Now, two sequels and three upgrades later, the newest reworking of Guilty Gear XX Accent Core by developer Arc System Works for the PlayStation 2 shows off that staying power that has garnered respect from fighting gamers all over the world - 2D fighting is far from gone.

Boasting an impressive 23 characters, there is plenty of variety and depth to be explored. 

Each fighter sports his or her own unique arsenal that sets them apart from each other and from most traditional fighting games altogether.  

From a paper bag-wearing doctor to a womanizing pirate, Guilty Gear has been known for its motley cast while offering fast-paced action that requires adaptation and execution.  

With some new tweaks, moves and features like force breaks - powered up special moves - Accent Core forces veterans to relearn their favorite characters and adopt new tactics to win. 

Besides the prerequisite fighting game features - solo, versus play and training modes - the game offers some extras such as a score attack, alternate versions of characters and previous versions of the Guilty Gear system.  

Like any great fighting game, however, Guilty Gear truly shines when played with human competition.

Accent Core hasn't changed too much in the aesthetics department. 

The sharp, high-resolution visuals hold up very well today and the characters still have their anime-inspired charm. 

The stages have been redrawn for this edition of the game, while the older backgrounds are still available. 

A collection of illustrations is also available for viewing pleasure.  

Guilty Gear is meant to be played loud. Daisuke Ishiwatari composes the musical thunder that has been a hallmark of the series. 

Heavy-metal tracks compliment the stages and the fury of the game's high speed combat as well as it always has throughout the years. 

Some new tracks and reworked character voiceovers also dot the game's audio.

While many fighters have come and gone, Guilty Gear has continued to stand the test of time. 

New publisher Aksys Games has done a great service to fighting gamers here in the U.S. by bringing a top-quality fighter for all to enjoy and rediscover the magic of 2D gaming. 

Nintendo Wii owners can expect their own version of the game to be released around October.

Headline: HIGH VOLTAGE: UF student unfairly silenced
Author: Joseph Marhee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Senator John Kerry should have expected questions like Andrew Meyers', a Journalism and Mass Communications student at the University of Florida, but no one could have anticipated the events that followed: After Meyers' passionate line of questioning regarding President Bush and Kerry's involvement in a secret society at Yale University among other well publicized allegations of the two's connections, Meyer was restrained by several police officers. 

As the videos posted on CNN.com and MSNBC.com show, one officer brandished a firearm while the others tackled and tased him. Consequently, the officers involved in Meyers' arrest are under investigation regarding their use of a taser, but is this really anything new?

 Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no. In the last year alone, student groups such as Students for a Democratic Society, Students for Informed Democracy and several smaller groups have protested policies that they call, "oppressive and unconstitutional." 

At the University of Central Florida, hundreds of students participated in a protest opposing the universities "Free-Speech Zone Policy". Partick DeCarlo, a UCF student and member of Students for a Democratic Society, said in a local news report earlier this year, "This policy undermines the 1st Amendment of the constitution and where it can be practiced" . The students of UCF's chapter of Students for a Democratic Society further expressed their distaste for the administration's reaction to the protest: Doing absolutely nothing except increasing the number of officers. The increase was in order to keep the peace, according to a written response from UCF's President Hitt.

The deplorable part about this whole issue is that they're orally restrained by officers who have "forgotten the contents of the Bill of Rights."

Case in point: The incident at UF on September 16th. Meyers was allegedly cut off because "He used profanity and his question was too long," according to Steven Blank, the chairman of Accent, UF's Speakers Bureau. The police officers involved, despite request of Sen. Kerry to "Cool down", continued with the overzealous assault on Mr. Meyers, who was screaming for help and asking to be told what he had done to warrant an arrest. He was answered by nothing more than several shots of a taser gun.

Others at the University, feel Meyers got off easy: "I hope nobody feels sorry for the young man who got tased. I expect that on campus this week, angry protestors will blame the University Police Department for being too aggressive, or blame Accent for inviting Sen. John Kerry to speak or blame Tennessee for riling us all up." wrote Kyle Cox, a UF student and part of a group called Speaking Out, in the University of Florida Newspaper, The Alligator.

In the wake of the incident, two protests and a sit-in have ensued. Many UF students are outraged by the investigation of the use of the taser. 

Additionally, several students have demanded that the committee who investigates this must be entirely neutral.

After reading the University's inconsistent police report, with each officer's account more sensationalized than the last, it's hard not to imagine Meyers being acquitted of any and all charges.  

 Being that he was orally suppressed and was the recipient of physical punishment for his "diatribe", as one Accent representative put it; Meyers' supporters admit that his behavior at the Kerry event was a little out of line and inappropriate, but even more disgusting and inappropriate (not to mention unlawful and unconstitutional) was the behavior of the University Police Department.

The University of Florida, along with several other Florida universities have policies regarding Free-Expression and how law enforcement are to deal with it. 

If Meyers is ruled against and convicted of the charges they claim he is guilty of, then it will confirm what one could assume are America's next steps to becoming a police state.

Headline: Editorial: Faculty deserves reason for evictions
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The College of Arts and Sciences got a memo Aug. 24 from FIU administrators, the memo, written by Associate Vice Presidents for research, Andres Gil and Jonathan Tubman, was essentially an eviction notice for 16 or so of the College's professors.

It gave professors five weeks - until Oct. 1 - to clear out their labs so Gil and Tubman could reassign their research space to someone else. To whom? The memo didn't say. And why on such short notice? The memo didn't say either. 

The eviction notice distressed research faculty, not because of what's being done - evicting professors from their labs - but because of how it's being done - hastily and without explanation.

Most faculty members agree: reassigning research space is not inherently bad. 

It's necessary to free  some research space and make room for new faculty, for one thing. 

And over time, as grants expire, research projects are completed and faculty come and go, it's good to make sure FIU's precious research space is being used efficiently. Some researchers have too much space, others not enough. Labs have served as office spaces and broom closets, making it desirable to clean house. 

The problem isn't what is done, but how.

In December 2006, both Provost Ronald Berkman and Vice Presiden of Research George Walker assured faculty that any reassignment would happen in close consultation with the Faculty Senate's Research Council. 

By unilaterally evicting faculty from their labs according to that formula, faculty believe that Walker and Berkman betrayed them.

Berkman and College of Medicine Dean John Rock have long told faculty the medical school is still a long while away from hiring researchers. 

Berkman said that the Aug. 24 memo is unrelated with the College of Medicine, but abundant research space could help lure big-name professors to the new College of Medicine. 

And the College's review for accreditation is only a month away - close to the memo's Oct. 1 eviction date. 

Whether the evictions are related to the College of Medicine is unimportant. Neglecting to tell faculty why they must vacate their research labs - and making room for fearful speculation - is damage enough. 

To make matters worse the aggressive, five-week timetable administrators are pushing for researchers to dismantle and empty out their research labs in not only unreasonable, it does little more than aggravate faculty misgivings toward administrators. And that's what's really at stake in this squabble for lab space: a workable relationship between FIU's faculty and administration.  

It falls, then, on administrators to pursue openness, dialgoue and trust in administrator-faculty relationships. Instead, by acting unilaterally, by going back on promises, by not acting transparently, faculty membes are given a reason to feel betrayed, angry and afraid.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Department chair responds to article
Author: Julian Edward / Mathematics Department Chair
&nbsp;
I wish to respond to several the points made in the Beacon's article "College Algebra Failure Rate under Investigation".

First, the headline suggests that there is some misconduct by the Math Department or someone else, and that is certainly not the case.

Second, the article suggests, essentially using second-hand gossip as evidence, that all of our adjunct instructors are ineffective teachers. This is grossly unfair to the many very good adjuncts that we do have.

 In addition, the article states that I said "students can help solve this problem by completing six hours or more of college algebra homework in the online tutoring program". 

What I actually stated was that the typical student should do at least six hours of homework a week on College Algebra - not necessarily with any online tutorial program. Doing exercises from the textbook is the best single way of helping oneself in any math course.

Finally, I mistakenly said the Math Department offers tutoring in DM 409A - this should be DM 409C.

Headline: Researchers face eviction
Author: Nicole Acosta / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
When Maureen A. Donnelly was told on Sept. 4 that she was one of the 16 professors named in a memo that explained the possibly of her research lab being reclaimed and reassigned, she felt her work as a biological sciences professor and tropical herpetologist had been insulted, demeaned and devalued.

"When I came to FIU, I envisioned being a lifer. My research as a tropical biologist is in the Americas, and Miami is a perfect place to be. 

I believe and still believe my work here helps improve the quality of this institution and imagine an eviction notice comes. It was like a gut shot. At first I was hurt and then I was just mad," said Donnelly, who has worked at FIU for 14 years and had designed her own lab.

This memo was sent by Andres G. Gil and Jonathan G. Tubman, vice presidents for research, to Kenneth Furton, associate dean for the College of Arts and Sciences. 

The Aug. 24 memo said a meeting had taken place that day in order to review research space assignments of professors and researchers within the College of Arts and Sciences in order to identify space assignments of unfunded researchers and to discuss when they could be vacated and reassigned, the memo said.

It also said that George Walker, vice president of research, expected targeted professors to vacate their research spaces for reassignment by Oct. 1.

A second memo contained an updated list of arts and sciences labs targeted for possible reassignment. Set to supersede the first memo, it would focus on several criteria, including the amount of outside funding received and the number of graduate students working there. Several names and labs, such as Donnelly's, did not appear in the second memo because the labs' utilization had been reconsidered, but Gil still requested confirmation of the labs' space availability by Oct. 1.

Ronald Berkman, the University's provost, said its imperative to evaluate the lab space.

"The University has a finite amount of research space. The expectation is for faculty to generate sponsored research grants," he said.

Walker, who reports to Berkman, had been delegated to work with the Faculty Senate's Ad Hoc Research Council on the policy. 

Berkman said it had been agreed to use Walker's and the research committee's proposed formula despite differences of opinion.

According to a Dec. 5, 2006 Faculty Senate meeting's minutes, a report was given by Bernard Gerstman, chair of the Research Council, expressing concern about Walker's space utilization policy and the Research Council's lack of input.

Berkman said at the meeting that the policy would not be implemented without discussion with the Research Council. 

Philip K. Stoddard, professor of biological sciences and faculty senator, said this never happened.

Donnelly said she feels the damage has been done and is now looking for employment elsewhere.

"I don't feel secure in my academic home. I feel like the University did not recognize my contributions to University life," Donnelly said. 

According to Donnelly, the University is evaluating indirect cost rate returns being generated from on-campus research versus off-campus research, which generates a smaller indirect cost rate.

If a professor does not generate an indirect cost return for the University, their research space will be vulnerable to possible reclamation and reassignment, Donnelly said.

Stoddard said this policy is only based on the money researchers bring in and the number of graduate students are employed in each lab.

"If I collect data off campus and I have to analyze the data on campus and store my equipment there, then you need a space. This is being devalued," Stoddard said.

Berkman said the focus is based on the labs meeting the second memo's requirements.

"Everyone could think their research will change the world. We need a mechanism to determine whether the use of the labs [coincide] with the goals discussed collaboratively with the Faculty Senate," Berkman said.

Stoddard feels FIU's environment, which once supported academia, is being eroded.

"If we trust each other we can work as a team. If we don't trust each other, we can't," he said.

Some biological sciences faculty believe that these spaces are being targeted in order to make room for future researches for the College of Medicine who would generate high rates of indirect costs.

Donnelly said that John Rock, College of Medicine dean, and Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, College of Medicine executive associate dean of Academic Affairs, held a meeting with biological sciences faculty Aug. 30 and said their priority is currently accreditation, not research, but Berkman said the policy implementation had nothing to do with this.

"If the College of Medicine had never happened, we would have looked at the lab spaces anyway," he said.

Headline: FIU welcomes new librarian
Author: Lauren Agosto / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Chosen from a group of about 60 applicants, FIU has named Laura Probst its new dean of University libraries. 

Probst, who will start working at FIU Oct. 1, comes from Pennsylvania State University, where she served as head of public services and associate librarian for the past seven years.

She said the faculty's enthusiasm for the University and its future is what first attracted her to FIU.

"The opportunities available here are exciting. I would like to be a part of that process and help shape FIU's future," Probst said. 

As Dean of University Libraries, Probst's responsibilities at FIU will include setting the strategic priorities for the library, overseeing its budget and staff, and working with fellow deans and administrators to ensure that the library is an effective partner in advancing the University's strategic priorities.

The candidates were narrowed down by a search and screen committee led by Mark D. Szuchman, dean of the college of arts and sciences, and which also included department leaders from the libraries and faculty members. 

 "I believe Laura Probst will be an exceptional addition to our libraries and to the contributions they provide both to the learning and the research mission of our University," Szuchman said. "She is experienced and very energetic, and I expect that she will bring those assets to reinvigorate the libraries, improve their services and strengthen the collections and their delivery." 

After the committee narrowed down the number of applicants, the final decision was made by Vice President and Provost Ronald Berkman, who described Probst as "experienced, extremely bright, [with] very good interpersonal skills, and [with] a great vision for what the University library should be."

Some might have noticed that Probst's dean of University libraries' title is different from the former executive director of libraries. 

"This change on the one hand reflects the current situation in which the executive director has been a member of the council of deans and functions in many ways as a dean, and on the other hand is indicative of the increasing importance of the University libraries in an age of information," Berkman said.

Probst received a master's in library science from the University of Illinois. She also holds a master's in musicology from the University of Minnesota.  While at Pennsylvania State University, she led library efforts to build Web-based services, including four components: chat software, e-mail/Web form functionality, a knowledge base, and a management infrastructure. She managed 11 subject libraries and oversaw reference and user services, among other functions. 

Antonie Downs, who served as interim director of libraries for two years, will return to the Biscayne Bay Campus and resume his permanent position there as executive associate director and University libraries budget officer.

"[Probst's] background in academic libraries, her experience in large public institutions and her enthusiasm make her exceptional among the other candidates," Downs said.

Headline: Dean promotes Hispanic students
Author: David A. Barrios / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Vishwanath Prasad, executive dean of the College of Engineering and Computing, will be recognized by the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Conference Oct. 12 for his accomplishments making his college one of the premier places for education in the field among Hispanics.

CEC is the number one in graduating Hispanics with bachelors and master degrees in engineering in the country, winning the National Diversity Award in 2006, Prasad said. 

"So [CEC] is a melting pot for Latinos and Hispanic Americans to enrich their cultural intake. You give them a globalized education at the bottom level, in the bachelors, at the best level possible," Prasad said. 

The school has gradually increased enrolment of students from Latin America, and 15 percent of the enrollment in the school of engineering consists of international students studying in the United States on visas, not including permanent residents or citizens of Latin American countries, he added.

FIU's increase of enrolment in its engineering program contrasts the running trend in other schools around the country where enrolment levels have been falling, Prasad said.

"FIU has become a role model for engineering education for Hispanics," said Prasad.

The cause of Hispanics in the engineering world is one that Prasad has championed in the past years by becoming one of the founding members of the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions. He also helped establish the LA grid, a forum for engineers in Latin America to communicate with one another. 

A native of India, Prasad has a master in mechanical engineering from the India Institute of Technology at Kanpur, India, and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Delaware.

When asked the reason for his focus on Hispanic engineers, Prasad answered that he identifies with Latinos because of the different cultures and customs of his home country.

"India … is quite diverse from region to region. The language, the food … and there are over six-hundred dialects in the language and at least three major religions practices there. So you are exposed to diversity from the day you are born, much like in Latin America," Prasad said.

Headline: PUERTO RICAN GLORY: Volleyball pair competes in world games
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Two vital pieces of the women's volleyball team crossed paths in Puerto Rico long before they walked hallways of FIU together.

Sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa and teammate Natalia Valentin share passion and dedication for volleyball and their home country. 

This past summer, their abilities and determination were rewarded when they were given the opportunity to represent Puerto Rico in the 2007 Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB) Women's Junior World Championships. 

Growing up in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, Rosa always looked up to her big sister Coral Bel Mar. 

As Coral flourished on her high school's volleyball squad, a much younger Rosa found joy in tossing the volleyball around from as early as the first grade, in hopes of being just like her big sister one day. 

Meanwhile, towards the central region of Puerto Rico, in Caguas, another little girl snuggled in front of a television screen watching countless volleyball games, idolizing local volleyball star Michelle Cardona. With the love for the sport ignited in both of them, it was only a matter of time before Rosa and Valentin crossed paths in high school.

Rosa was a star player at Marista High School while Valentin made her mark with rival Adianez High. Rosa made her national debut at 14 years old with the senior national team, before there even was a junior national system in place in Puerto Rico. 

"When I first got that call at 14, I was really excited," Rosa said. "I couldn't believe that they were calling me already. There were just 12 players on the team representing the place where I was born and you have to be proud to be one of them.

 "I was really nervous because everyone on the team was so much more experienced. I felt unsure of myself at first, but once I got out on the court with them I just played hard. It felt good to make my parents proud because they never thought that volleyball would take me that far so early."

There were no such butterflies for Valentin, who made her national team debut at the 2006 North, Central American and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation (NORCECA) Continental Women's Junior Championships in Monterrey, Mexico.

"I am never nervous and I don't have pressure because I like to have a good time out there," Valentin said. "I really love the game." 

After a third place performance at NORCECA, the Golden Panther duo looked forward to putting Puerto Rico on the map at the world championships held from June 20-27th in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. 

Unfortunately, the competition was much tougher this time around and the undermanned squad stumbled. 

Rosa was sidelined with a knee injury as Puerto Rico dropped its first game against Italy, 3-1. Rosa came back for the second game, but it a Ukraine squad that cruised to an easy 3-0 victory. 

Following that setback, Puerto Rico gave their best performance of the opening round aganst Croatia, but still lost, 3-2. When it was all said and done, Puerto Rico went 0-5 in the preliminary round. However, they did garner two wins in the classification games with a 3-0 win over Dominica and a 3-1 victory over Croatia.  

"We knew that the world championships would be really hard because we had a short team, but we just went out and played," Rosa said. "Our coach told us that there was a good chance we wouldn't win it all, and he wanted us to focus on the two games outside of the preliminary round,"

According to Valentin, the championships were tough but she was happy that Rosa got to play.

"At one moment, we felt like we weren't going to do anything good in Thailand because [Yarimar] had an injury," Valentin said. "But then something happened and she was able to play and everyone was happy and excited after that. I think that Yarimar gave us hope."

Rosa had her best game against Croatia with 36 kills, while Valentin picked up valuable international experience by playing in every game. Puerto Rico finished ninth overall, ahead of Croatia, the Dominican Republic and Egypt. 

Now that they are back in Miami, the tandem is doing their part to keep the Golden Panthers among the volleyball elite. 

Rosa has picked up right where she left off last season as a dominant scorer and Valentin has been adapted well in her first year at FIU, sharing time with veteran setter Keila Oliveira. 

Coach Danijela Tomic believes that the history between Valentin and Rosa helps them on the court.

"They are very good friends," Tomic said. "They have one huge thing in common and they definitely enjoy listening to Reggaeton together. They share that iPod and just start singing that Reggaeton.

"Yarimar talks more to Natalia and they communicate really well on the court. I think because they are close friends it helps them be more comfortable with each other."

Rosa has already achieved All-American status, while the 18-year-old Valentin is just trying to make her mark. As the two continue their close friendship and work on their games, they hope to make the Puerto Rican Junior National Team a force the next time around. 

They may have started out as young high school rivals, but now they are college teammates carrying the dream of a nation.

Headline: NFL Draft eludes former Golden Panther linebacker
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Last season, linebacker Alexander Bostic III was part of the 28th ranked defense in Division I-A football. He racked up 98 tackles and eight sacks and worked out with NFL stars like Willis McGahee and Ed Reed in the time leading up to the draft in order to get himself into shape for the NFL.

During the NFL draft, held April 28 and 29, he watched as teammates Antwan Barnes and Chandler Williams were selected by the Baltimore Ravens and Minnesota Vikings, respectively. 

His accolades and training were for naught and reality hit him; he would not be drafted by an NFL football team.

"I felt like everything I worked for went down the drain," Bostic said. "When you're a kid, your dream is to play in the NFL and to have that fall out of your hands, is like someone ripped your heart out."

Not making the NFL has proven to be an extremely difficult thing to overcome for some college athletes and some never get over it, said team chaplain Steve Lantz, who has known Bostic since he was a sophomore at Norland High School.

"There have been guys who haven't reacted well to their draft status. Great pressure brings out the best and worst in people," Lantz said. "Before the draft he was pretty realistic, he was hoping to get drafted and he was working for that end. And obviously he was disappointed, but it wasn't the type of disappointment that some people have where it's a panic."

Bostic said he was in a difficult situation, but with the help of his family, including his father who is a pastor at First Baptist Church in West Park, he was able to get back to working toward other dreams.

"I had to pick myself up. My parents were there for me to guide me through it. They told me 'You're going to be alright,'" he said.

Having his father as a pastor has helped Bostic realize what is most important in life. Following the draft, he made the decision to come back to school and finish his degree in Sports Management.

He says he isn't completely disappointed he wasn't drafted by the NFL, because it has allowed him the opportunity to finish his degree.

"I thank God that I had the opportunity to come back to school instead of not making it with a team and then having to try to get back into it," Bostic said.

His faith has been a vital aspect of his life going back to his childhood all the way through high school. As a member of Norland High's 2002 6A state championship team, he had his faith help him get through the season, as a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes at his school.

"You've got to believe in something, especially when you can't go to the NFL," Bostic said. "Some people turn to drugs or get depressed, but my faith is where I'm grounded."

His faith has also led him to a unique plan for himself after obtaining his degree. He is looking to establish a program for young, talented high school athletes who may not have the grades or test scores to go to college and continue their education and athletics.

"The Right Path program is a vision the Lord put into me," Bostic said. "My goal is to get colleges back here to focus on Miami-Dade and also help high school students through athletics. It's a way they see to get out; it's a way to make them better men, better husbands and better fathers."

Although Bostic wasn't drafted, he has not cut off football from his life and has been working with the FIU football team as a graduate assistant, specifically focusing on the defensive line. 

"In practice, he's been working with the scout team, and they had some big plays and he was out there dancing around and jumping around like his team just won the national title," Lantz said. "There's no way you can look at him and say, 'That's a guy who didn't get drafted and he's really disappointed.' You can't say that about him."

Come December, Bostic may be putting the pads back on for the newly formed All American Football League, a league that stresses college graduation and promises professional pay rates and the opportunity to perform in front of fans.

"I tried out for the AAFL in Alabama and did good in that, so there's a strong possibility that I'll get called back," Bostic said.

If he makes it to the AAFL, it will be because of his ability to not dwell on the past and take advantage of opportunities presented to him.

"Like they say, one door closes and another opens."

Headline: Commentary: Dolphins' and Golden Panthers' seasons spiral down
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As the Golden Panthers and the Miami Dolphins continue their trek across a seemingly endless valley of grid iron ineptitude, the casual observer cannot help but notice the similarities between the two teams. 

For both teams, any sort of success seems to be a thing of the past. 

They both have solid defenses with standout players that must carry an offense mired by turnovers and three-and -outs. 

Both teams have new head coaches who haven't quite produced to the public's liking.

Upon closer inspection, however, one can see the drastically different directions that these teams are taking.

      The Dolphins issues are well chronicled, from utter failure stemming from a decade of poor first-round draft picks to a revolving door head coaching job. The quarterback situation is often pointed at, but it would be a lot easier for the Jay Fiedlers and Trent Greens of the world to be successful if they had even a modicum of talent surrounding them.

      The other perennial cellar dwellers in the NFL, such as the Oakland Raiders, the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals, all have a distinguishable future ahead of them. Oakland has the 2007 draft's first overall pick, JaMarcus Russell, waiting in the wings with all the physical talent a quarterback could need. 

The Lions have wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who many considered a future Hall of Famer even before playing an NFL down, along with fellow receiver Roy Williams, an established threat. Arizona has potential everywhere you look, from wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald to quarterback Matt Leinart to running back Edgerrin James. 

      Our hometown football team has Ronnie Brown, who is beginning to show more signs of bust rather than future Pro-Bowler, and Chris Chambers, who has the occasional spectacular catch but drops the simple passes more often than anyone wants. 

      The lone bright spot is 2006 Defensive Player of the Year, Jason Taylor, slowly reaching the final chapter of an illustrious career and dedicating himself to a useless organizations.      

In west Dade, meanwhile, the Golden Panthers find themselves in a similar hole. Teams around the state are making national news, from the University of South Florida in contention the Big East Conference to Florida Atlantic's upsets of Minnesota in which the Owls put up more points than FIU has all season.

      The team suffers simply from a lack of talent, which is an indictment of former coach Don Strock rather than the new regimen of Athletic Director Pete Garcia and new coach Mario Cristobal.

It is the complete overhaul of the football team that gives FIU fans hope as opposed to the reluctant Dolphins fans. 

One must simply look at last year as to see why these teams are heading in such different directions.

To put it simply, FIU has acknowledged the problem, severed the main issues of the program and are letting it grow anew. From hiring a new athletic director, coach and staff, the season screams rebuilding, which the team isn't afraid to acknowledge. 

In Davie, however, the Dolphins keep applying bandages, antiseptic and painkillers in an attempt to overlook the real problem and do what is necessary to fix it.

A combination of bad draft picks and terrible signings and trades have contributed to making the team as bad as any in the league the past couple of years. 

Jerry Porter is paid $20 million to record two tackles a game, while a third-round pick is given up for Lamont Gordon and a second for the incompetent AJ Feeley.

If a bet had to be placed on which team will be more successful in five years, a wise man would place it on the Golden Panthers. 

The Dolphins will be feeling the repercussions of their drafts and signings for years to come, while FIU will continue to attract the fabled South Florida talent that made the UM a national powerhouse. 

Despite still lacking that all important win, the Golden Panthers are building their team from the ground up and showing improvement with every passing game. 

The Dolphins, with all their history and lore, on the other hand, are deteriorating before our eyes.
