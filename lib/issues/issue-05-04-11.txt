Headline: Social Security  and Medicaid by GOP Hoax
Subheadline:  
Author: ikiraf@yahoo.com
&nbsp;
GOP is playing a game by saying social security is "some" IOU in a little file box. I am happy it is an IOU from the people of the greatest nation on earth, and not from Enron and other NY Stock Market's trust worthy companies... that is what personal accounts will be. Thanks! That's what we need... Let us all join the Enron employee's pension plan. Poll them and check for satisfaction.
All this talk about medical and prescription costs overwhelming our budget in 10 years or so. Bush must have really helped by keeping the biggest drug buyer in the planet (US Gov.) from bargaining with drug makers!
This is a GOP hoax on the people. Their motivation is not to keep people secure, but to bankrupt the entirety of the Social Security and Medicare systems.
Just like the budget that happens not to take into consideration the cost of a WAR. What king of Budget is that... Let us all trust that type of competence with the security of our most needy...

Hi, my name is Piero Velarde, freshman, Accounting major and my phone # is 305-979-8619.

I was wondering if The Beacon could write an article about aderol.  Finals are coming up and its use is a big topic among my classmates and friends.  An article on its use, abuse, side effects, and pretty much any useful information on the use of this drug among college students would a really good read.

If you don't have anyone to write it, I would be happy to submit a paper on it.

Thanks for you time,

Headline: Pitcher epitomizes modern-day Renaissance man
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Most people say a Renaissance man no longer exists. Nowadays, more emphasis is put on being trained in one specific field, craft or subject instead of taking on various interests. 

But when you see number 38 for the Golden Panthers take the mound, you realize that sometimes most people are wrong.

Jon Banke is not only a starting pitcher for the baseball team, the big lefty is also involved in other aspects of FIU.

Since coming to FIU in Fall 2003 as a transfer student from Liberty University in Virginia, Banke has contributed to quite a few organizations on campus.

He was a part of the Village Council for student housing, did the news and helped with promotions for WRGP Golden Panther Radio, was a staff writer for The Beacon and is currently the vice-president for the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.

"I try to learn a little about everything," said Banke. "Just 'cause I figure, the more you know, the more you can help out and stay around."

Banke doesn't limit his learning to FIU campus life. He is majoring in criminal justice and is also a fisherman, a free-diver and a skydiver. While in high school, Banke almost completed the course to get his pilot's license.

But says his biggest passion is space flight - a passion that began in the seventh grade.

"Through high school, that was the biggest aspect of my life," Banke said. "I was probably more into that than I was into baseball."

Until his freshman year of college, he wrote about space shuttle launchings for several different human space flight websites.

"I know a lot of people in [NASA]," Banke said. "I know some astronauts at Kennedy Space Center and some at Johnson Space Center [in Houston]."

Banke still loves the space program and would do just about anything to go see a launch. 

"I've left the dorms in the middle of the night, had class the next day, but I've gone up to see a launch at three or four in the morning," Banke said. "I'd drive back, pull on to campus at 9:15 a.m., park in the dorms and head to my 9:30 a.m. class. Those are some of the best memories of my life, those late night road trips."

Banke has seen 19 successful shuttle launches and been to over 40 attempts, so he's seen his fair share of miscues. 

After a witnessing a failed launch at Kennedy Space Center in May of 2002, Banke was invited to go to a restaurant at Port Canaveral with other members of the press. He considered them his "buddies" even though they were over twice his age.

At the restaurant he was introduced to Rick Husband, future commander of STS-107, Space Shuttle Colombia, and talked to him for over two hours, picking his brain on different topics regarding space missions. 

But tragedy struck on Feb. 1, 2003 when Colombia broke up during re-entry over Texas en route to landing at Kennedy Space Center, after a successful 16-day mission, killing all seven crew members on board.

"He was the coolest, nicest man in the world," Banke said. "It was tough, man, when that bird failed on the way home. It's different. I knew a guy that's up there."

Even more touching, Banke received an e-mail from Husband, while Husband was in space.

"I sent him an e-mail two weeks before [the Colombia] launch saying 'good luck' and stuff," Banke said. "Sure enough, four days into the [mission] I got an e-mail back from him saying, 'Can't write long, but I got your e-mail and just wanted to say thanks. We're up here having a great time.' And I was like, wow that [e-mail] is from space."

Baseball, however, is still Banke's first love, but it sometimes prevents him from pursuing his other interests.

"It takes up so much time," Banke said. "If I don't do [the things I want to do] in the precious time I have in the summer, it's not gonna get done until the next summer. [They] just get pushed back, and sometimes different things just come up, like summer baseball or the money's not there."

Ask around the clubhouse, and anyone can tell you a story about Banke.

"He's one of the best teammates I've ever had. We have the same major, so when I came to FIU, he helped me out with what classes to pick and helped me study," said senior pitcher David Asher.

"I admire Jon. I think he leads by example ... He's got a very dry sense on humor that keeps [the team] amused," said junior relief pitcher Frank Gonzalez.

Is there anything Banke doesn't do well?

"I don't paint." Banke said. "But I am learning to play the guitar, even though I'm struggling with it a bit."

Headline: Should NCAA athletes receive salaries? - Part 2
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Whether a college athlete gets paid shouldn't be an issue. This dollar commodity has become ugly in the world of sports.

In past years, professional associations like the NBA and the NFL have been granting kids who can barely vote lucrative contracts, seven-figure shoe deals and more commercialism than a prepubescent boy can handle.

The sports enterprise has grown to such monstrous proportions that there is just no way to stop the amount of money being thrown around.

The only halt put on the worldwide expenditures of sports has been at the collegiate level - the only level of sports that is not dominated by money or "collective-bargaining."

College basketball's March Madness has become more popular than the NBA playoffs, because people like watching athletes play for the true joy of the game.

The ambiance of college sports simply wouldn't be the same if there were a dollar sign in front of it. It would no longer have that edge of playing for the love of the game.

I'll admit that the NCAA rules are strict, but that's the way it has to be.  Today's sports world is so competitive that loopholes are constantly being searched to gain an edge on competition.

A plan has to be flawless so it doesn't get torn apart, and I believe that's the current NCAA plan.

The sports world should give a message for athletes to stay in school. We want athletes to get their degrees and then go pro, not completely skip college and go into a professional sport barely knowing algebra.  

Nobody knows what can happen once they jump to the professional level.

In 2001, Duke University standout point guard Jay Williams got into a motorcycle accident and broke both of his legs.

It is doubtful whether he will ever be able to play basketball again. 

After the accident, the Chicago Bulls (the team he was playing for at the time) bought out the remainder of Williams's contract, and he was left with not enough to live on for the rest of his life.

But you know what? Jay Williams went to school, was one of the greatest point guards at his school, was a first round draft pick and still finished his sociology degree in three years.

Even though Williams can barely walk, he has his degree, and that stays with him for the rest of his life.	

By paying college athletes, the point is being completely missed. 

The purpose of giving them scholarships is so they can attend a university and study.  

A very small percentage of college athletes actually make it pro. We need to keep the players' minds on their books, not money.

You can argue that professional sports have been tarnished in some way during recent years. 

The influx of high school basketball players jumping to the NBA has become preposterous.  

Pro scouts are looking at kids in middle school to someday get them on their team.  

When those kids go to high school, do you think they're going to worry about how well they do on their SATs?

They're going to get an easy ride through high school, jump straight to the pros and be another statistic for uneducated Americans (and you wonder where the stereotypes come from).

This money enterprise in sports keeps growing, and we need to put a stop to it before it gets out of control (if it already hasn't).

Student-athletes are given more than enough to make it through. 

 They don't need to be given a salary. We would completely ruin all that collegiate athletics stands for and ruin the minds of our next generation.

Headline: Should NCAA athletes receive salaries? - Part 1
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Any time the topic of the NCAA comes up, it often deals with the issue of college boosters, illegal privileges and whether or not the college athletes should get paid.

If college athletes were paid, then many problems and illegal wrong doings would decrease substantially. 

Let's make it clear right away. These students put forth maximum time and effort into the athletic programs, yet they are not rewarded. And someone will try to justify that as fair.

Give me a break. That is absolutely ridiculous! These student-athletes deserve much better. Yes, they get free education and that's good. But, while in school, they must also have the financial resources to be able to feed and clothe themselves and still have a chance to have some fun.

Now, to some this may sound a bit too dramatic and difficult to believe. It's not. 

Former college athletes have told many stories about how difficult it was for them to make ends meet while in college.

One story that stands out the most, for me, is that of former UCLA standout linebacker Donnie Edwards, who currently plays for the San Diego Chargers.

While at UCLA, he was an All-American football player who was suspended for a game because he accepted a gift. 

The gift wasn't a car with shiny rims on it, or an all expense paid trip out of town or any other perk that college athletes receive, which you may have heard of on the news. 

The gift was a couple of bags filled with groceries waiting at the doorstep of his room. It may sound silly, but he was suspended for one game. The incident was even investigated by the NCAA.

The current NCAA rules and regulations read: "DO NOT provide a student-athlete or friend any benefit or special arrangement. The NCAA considers these as an 'extra benefit' and they are specifically prohibited."

So, the groceries that Edwards received from an anonymous source were ruled as an "extra benefit" and specifically prohibited. Thus, came the punishment.

Meanwhile, replicas of Edwards's college jersey (with only his number) were hanging on racks in sporting good stores throughout California, which generated revenue for the NCAA.

It would be an absurd statement for NCAA officials to suggest that college athletics do not generate enough revenue to pass on to the athletes. But, they continuously make that claim. On "Outside the Lines," an ESPN program, the NCAA President Myles Brand explained that only 12 or so athletic programs are able to break even, when it comes to revenue. He also mentioned that the NCAA's annual revenue is not as great as often perceived.

It sounds comical, especially when you hear that CBS and NCAA have just agreed on a $6 billion, an 11-year contract that will expand the network's exclusive right to televise the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, according to CNN. 

That is approximately $545 million that NCAA will earn per year. 

Plus, all the revenue that is made from the football bowl games and television contracts cannot be ignored. 

We're not talking about making these student-athletes millionaires, but giving them a reasonable monthly stipend of around $500, which would help them survive college life. 

This is a very difficult subject and it can be argued either way. The simplified version of the NCAA's main argument against wages for student athletes is that the athletes are getting a free education and that playing sports in college is not a profession or a business. 

College sports are only entertainment for the viewers and fans. It is not as fun as the outsiders perceive it to be, just like in professional sports.

NCAA athletes devote all their energy to this business. Anyone who knows first hand about college athletics knows that it is a tough job and not just a game.

Headline: Athletic fee among highest in nation
Author: Harry Coleman / News Editor
&nbsp;
Student athletic fees at FIU are 68 percent higher than the national average for Division I-A schools, according to the NCAA annual report Revenues and Expenses of Intercollegiate Athletics.

Under the budget, revealed on March 29, FIU students next year would pay $10.1 million of the school's $13.8 million athletic budget, or 73 percent.

"That is unusually high, and the magnitude concerns me," said Daniel Fulks, who compiles the NCAA annual report, in an interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. "The national average is about 5 percent," he said. 

Florida Atlantic University is facing the same issue. At FAU, student fees provide $7.9 million of this year's $10.87 million athletic budget, also 73 percent.

Last year, after a student vote, FIU raised the athletic fee by $1.38, the maximum amount allowed following a student vote.

"We had to go to the students and they answered yes. As we continue to mature, it is my hope that our budget is dependent on an outside income," said Athletic Director Rick Mello. "If the students would not have agreed [on the raise], we would not be where we are today."

Students at FIU were providing the majority of athletic funds before football was added in 2002; the sport that forced the raise in athletic fees in the last year. The football program averages a yearly cost of $3 million, but revenues have fallen short every year.

Ticket sales provide an average of 27 percent of revenue at I-A schools, yet FIU expects to get less than 5 percent of it's athletic revenue from ticket sales next year. 

According to Mello, FIU generates 15 to 20 percent of its funding from ticket sales and outside funding, which include private donations.

The football program is the main reason the athletic fee went up last year according to Mello. Attendance at football games is still very low and years away from providing an income for the athletic department.

The program, which is entering its second transition season of I-A football, failed to meet the mandatory 15,000 average last season. FIU averaged 10,095 in home attendance last season, falling short of the 15,000 mark.

"Since we are a new program, we don't have tradition to count on," Mello said. "I never told people that it was a quick fix. You can throw all the money you want, but tradition is not one of them." 

Mello believes it will take a range between 20 and 25 years to create a football tradition at FIU.

"What we do today is for 25 years down the road. People have to understand that," Mello said. "Our students down the road, when they are alumni - 20 to 25 years from now, they will be amazed."

Author: Damian Grass / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
More than 3,800 FIU students voted in the Student Government Association elections  April 5 and 6, to elect a new slate of council officials, which were announced on April 7.

With a waterfall of red, white and blue balloons and "Hail to the Chief" blasting through speakers, "The Pit" at University Park looked more like a U.S. presidential campaign victory party.

Alex Prado and Christine Denton stood in front of a cheering crowd as newly elected  UP SGA president and vice president, respectively. The two will lead the SGA during the 2005-2006 school year.

Prado, a member of Pi Kappa Alpha, was serenaded by a group of fraternity brothers shortly after the announcement ceremony.

"It feels amazing," Prado shouted over the music. "I would have never been here if it weren't for my supporters."

Winning by only 234 votes, 1696 to 1462, over their opponents, Aurelio "PJ" Rivera and Chaz-Lit Droguett, Prado and Denton are eager to start their new jobs right away ... well just after a much awaited victory party.

"We're ready to start working, but first ... celebration!" Denton yelled along with a group of fans.

Prado and Denton are anxious to develop an off-campus meal plan with the Panthercard, establish a better relationship between the Student Athlete Advisory Council and SGA, create an all-faith room for prayer, prohibit the implementation of block tuition and protect the Florida Bright Futures scholarship program.

This platform won over many student, but Victoria Lerma, a senior and Rivera/Droguett supporter, worries that the winners will not focus on what is most needed.

"I hope (Prado) remembers that it's not all about sports," she said. "I hope he uses the money towards academic programs that really need it."

The students, however, didn't forget about the other candidates.

For UP Representatives at Large, Alfonso "Alfie" Leon won with 1,306 votes, Mari Cabrera with 1,242 votes and Omer "Bill" Buchanan III with 793 votes.

Marbely Hernandez and Arthur "AJ" Meyer each received over 700 votes to win their newly appointed roles as UP Lower Division Representatives.

"I am so excited," Hernandez said. "I can't wait to start working with teachers, students and organizations."

Armando Aragon was voted Architecture Representative with 82 percent of the votes, Nidia Cruz was voted Honors College Representative with 68 percent and Judene Elesha Tulloch was voted Housing Representative with 54 percent.

While running unopposed, Cesar Quinzada received 69 votes for UP Graduate Student Representative, Anthony Delgado with 237 votes for Arts and Sciences Representative and Carlos Velazco with 109 votes for Business Representative.

Other unopposed winners included Chereen de Boehmler for Education Representative with 40 votes, Santiago Bermudez with 38 votes for Engineering Representative and Kimberly Castillo with 75 votes for Health and Urban Affairs Representative.

Headline: "Sin City" a faithful adaptation
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
In "Sin City", "Spy Kids" director Robert Rodriguez's latest movie, the heroes are square-jawed, the damsels always in distress and evil lies just a dark footstep away.

If the highly anticipated film's style sounds like the description of a comic book's plot, the similarities are not accidental. Rodriguez's noir movie is a frame-by-frame adaptation of comic book legend Frank Miller's graphic series of the same name.

Set in the shadowy underworld of the fictional Basin City, the film follows three loosely related story lines crammed with as much violence, gore and sex as a Quentin Tarantino movie (which is no surprise; the "Kill Bill" auteur is listed as a guest director).

The main narrative follows Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop-gone-good in a city full of corrupt officials. He risks everything to save a young stripper (Jessica Alba in her most erotic role to date) from the hands of a perverted madman (Nick Stahl).

The second story introduces the audience to the vengeful crusade of tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke) after the only woman who ever showed him any kind of love (Jaime King) is killed by a silent but deadly psycho (Elijah Wood).
 
Reformed murderer Dwight (Clive Owen) and bad-tempered Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) lead the final - and perhaps most bloody - story as their struggle brings a grim unbalance to a truce between the city's mafia, cops and prostitutes who are lead by fierce dominatrix Gail (Rosario Dawson).

Though the grade-A cast does its best to capture the insanity of their situations through dialogue ripped from the pages of Miller's work, some of the best performances came from supporting characters taking stale or corny lines and turning them into the most memorable parts of the movie.

Shellie (Brittany Murphy), the waitress caught between Dwight's and Jackie Boy's obsessions, brought such a subtle paranoia to the character that her lines, delivered with a perfect mix of threat and fear, usually stole the scenes. Also memorable were Rutger Hauer's brief appearance as a delusional archbishop, Elijah Wood's perfect characterization of angelic-looking cannibal Kevin and Alexis Bledel's turn as a double-crossing hooker.

Stylistically spectacular, Rodriguez's use of digital backdrops perfectly capture the city's black and white grit expressed so magnificently in Miller's books. By filming the actors against a green backdrop, the director could insert lights, doors, walls and shadows that perfectly mimicked the comic book art. A bit of color is masterfully splashed from time to time to accentuate a symbol within a scene, be it a quivering set of green eyes, a flowing red dress, crimson blood or blonde locks of hair.

In the end, Sin City is a beautiful film to look at and, though the stories don't merge perfectly and the over-dramatic dialogue may cause laughs at time, the film becomes a worthwhile trip into a the seedy underworld of criminals, hookers and the depraved.

Headline: Kutcher stars in remake of Stanly Kramer classic
Author: Earlyne Louis-Charles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you saw Stanly Kramer's "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" starring Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, you could imagine what the 2005 version "Guess Who" would be about. The 1967 original movie portrayed an interracial love story where a white woman brings home her African American love to meet her parents. The difference is, this movie, an African-American woman brings home her white hubby-to-be to meet her parents. The movie stars "Punked" host, Ashton Kutcher as Simon Green, the beautiful Zoe Saldana as Theresa, and funnyman Bernie Mac as Percy, a bank loan officer. In Sidney Poitier's years, interracial relationships were not so accepted, nowadays it's a like a fashion statement. 

As much as people would like to be accepted by their partner's parents, it can be a difficult situation when race is involved. Simon, a Wall Street trader, and Theresa, an artist, are engaged to be married, but Theresa has yet to introduce her parents to her beau. Percy, Theresa's father, and Marilyn, Theresa's mother (played by Judith Scott), naturally expected a black man to accompany their daughter, but are surprised when they are greeted by a white young man. Like the original movie, Percy and Marilyn live in an up-scale chateau in the suburbs.  Percy plays an over-protective father who wants the best for his daughter. He investigates Simon by getting a background check and a credit check that reveals his net worth. All in all, "Guess Who" is effective, in that it shows love has no color.

The movie uses a combination of sitcom and soap opera elements. This is where the actors can make their way out of a tough situation easily, like in the dinner table scene where Simon is forced to tell one too many jokes.  The movie would have been more dramatic if it had incorporated some of the elements that blacks and whites have in common as well as their differences and the things that are acceptable compared to the things that are offensive.

The movie is not something new; it just modernized the 1967 version. If you want to give your lover the heads up of what to do when they meet your parents, then this is the movie for you. Just make sure you tell your parents what to expect.

Headline: Chili Pepper perfects solo voice on new record
Author: Carlos Jordi / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Living under the influence of drugs has forced Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitarist, John Frusciante, to live a life of sorrow and reclusion. 

After recording the album Blood Sugar Sex Magic in the early '90s, Frusciante quit the Chili Peppers and took up a shameful addiction to heroin. In the gloom of his addiction, Frusciante recorded his first two solo albums, Niandra Lades & Usually Just A T Shirt and Smile From The Empty Streets That Hold You. 

Although the albums exhibited his soulful musical style, his depression and addiction were also evident. His musical potential was being held back by the use of drugs. These self-destructive habits, which were deteriorating his mind and body, nearly drove him to early death in the late 1990s. 

Sick of the habit and the life he was leading, Frusciante kicked heroin and rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1998. The reunited Chili peppers recorded Californication and Frusciante was once again playing the music he loved. 

After leaving behind the drugs that consumed him, Frusciante made up for lost time by recording several albums at a relatively quick pace. 

Within the last six months, Frusciante has had six consecutive album releases. His dedication has helped him create eclectic albums filled with originality. The Will To Death, The DC EP, Automatic Writing, Inside Of Emptiness, A Sphere In The Heart Of Silence and Curtains showcase six different sides of Frusciante. 

Curtains, his latest release, is an acoustic masterpiece. The album is the perfect culmination of the last six months, instilled with fear, hope and love. 

The songs are inspiring and, through references to his drug induced past, portray the afterlife as something that will free him. 

The album, which is best classified as folk, presents Frusciante delving deep into a genre he is relatively unfamiliar with and emerging with eleven songs that paint pictures of his emotions and feelings. His guitar playing follows its usual path. Simple chord progressions and soulful licks allow the listener to feel what he is playing. Frusciante's guitar becomes a vessel that allows the listener to travel through his soul. Raw emotion is felt with every note played on the fret board of his guitar.

It is through albums like Curtains that Frusciante proves his musical affluence. The desire and love he holds toward his music is obvious and audible throughout the album. The feeling he incorporates into his art creates a magical intensity. 

Although Curtains is the perfect ending to six months of consecutive releases, there is no doubt that Frusciante will continue to release powerful music.

Headline: Local band Legion hypes up crowd at Art Temple
Author: Paola Echegaray / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Art Temple in Miami Beach is a gutted Jewish temple showcasing local musical talent.

Once serving the community as a place of worship, the temple now attracts a local young crowd with musical talent and artistic ability.   

Charles Vasquez is responsible for gathering the talent, scouting local bands. "We're trying to build a good reputation.  I go to see each of the bands play in their own homes before they come here," said Vasquez.  

When I arrived at The Art Temple, the band performing was too forceful with their instruments and each musician seemed to be overpowering the other. It might have been the poor acoustics or their style, but whatever it was, I needed a break.  

On my way out I bumped into Alex Garcia, the lead guitarist for Legion who had set up an interview the band. 

I was introduced to FIU student Yahoteh Kokayi, an Everglades Hall resident, who plays drums for Legion. 

Kokayi said studying jazz performance influences the band's music even though the band mostly plays rock.  Garry Rodriguez, who plays bass for Legion, has roots in jazz and plays plenty of salsa and merengue, said that Incubus mostly influences him.  

Legion lead singer Leandro Onofrio who plays the piano and guitar described the band as a mix of Pearl Jam, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana and a bit of Creed - an influence the band downplays  ("Miniscule, really," Onofrio assured me).

Legion plays powerful and emotional rock, not just through their instruments, but through their body language and facial expressions. It's hard not to because most of Legion's songs are social commentary about life in general, usually a passionate subject. 

"I'm not a professional writer," said Onofrio. "I write randomly about random things.  There are times when I can pour out eight songs and other times when I'm completely dry." 

Rafael Moya, a Legion fan, said the band's sound was "controlled." 

"You could tell it was music and actual singing and not just shouting," said Moya. "There was range control." 

After hearing such praise, I was afraid I was getting my hopes up too high, especially after hearing the band before Legion play. The difference in caliber was obvious from the first note.  

Unlike the band before them, Legion played as one. It's not enough to say they played in unison because that's too obvious, but they were harmonious and complemented each other. No one was trying to overpower the other. 

Unfortunately, you couldn't hear Onofrio very well, but you could make out his vocal range and control. Onofrio didn't compete with the instruments, but let himself be carried by the music.  

The fact that they played well didn't blow me away; it was the passion with which they did so. It wasn't until the second song titled "Used To This" that I, along with the rest of the audience, was thoroughly impressed. 

I surveyed the room and saw everyone staring intently at the band. Onofrio belted out long and soulful vocals that were difficult to hear, but with such emotion you could not help but be moved by what you could make out.  

Garcia led smoothly into his solos, which he played with patience and control. He wasn't overpowered and did not try to overpower the band. 

Rodriguez played the bass as an extension of his body. He twisted and writhed with the music and truly seemed to be enjoying it. 

When I asked Vasquez what led him to ask Legion to perform at The Art Temple, he answered, "They were extremely professional in their set up and their songs are catchy. They're ready for radio."  

Though catchy isn't the most beloved of adjectives to describe a  rock band, it does describe one aspect of Legion's songs that grab and keep your attention. 

So catch Legionat a venue near you before they make it to radio, and we're left with uncontrolled punk bands.

Subheadline: Percussion concert stands out at Spring Music Festival
Author: Elena Bellon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's School of Music Spring Music Festival is an event that deserves praise and merit from all. 

Throughout the semester, a variety of events have taken place that portrayed different musicians performing different styles of music. 

The musical genre you encounter will depend on the evening in which you attend. 

Events include ensembles ranging from the FIU Big Band, Concert Choir, Wind Ensemble Compelling, harmonious and majestic, the performances delivered fall nothing short of purely impressive. 

One of those performances was the Percussion Ensemble Concert, coordinated by Michael Launius and taking place in April 5.

The whole evening was comprised of five separate, yet equally engaging numbers. 

The first was entitled "Celebration and Chorale," composed by Neil DePonte. 

This piece was fun, fast and set the mood for a lively and enjoyable night.  

"Percussion Quartet," by Lukas Foss, was the second piece performed. It differed from the first in that it started off a little slower but soon picked up pace. 

As soon as the listener thought the whole song was going to be slow, tempo picked up pace and the rest of the song went flying by.

Following "Percussion Quartet," was "Between the Lines," a piece by Lynn Glassock which was more intricate and dramatic than the rest. 

The sounds seemed to be more complex, yielding emotions a little deeper than those prompted by the first two numbers. 

The reactions of the audience seemed unreal when they realized how much feeling the musicians possessed.

After a short intermission, piece number four, Josh Gottry's "Shifting Waves", was performed by both current students and alumni members. 

This offered the chance for both current and former students to do what they love on stage and as a result, made for a fantastic piece of perfectly timed music.  

Piece number five seemed to be the more animated of the pieces.  "Transformaticisms," by Phillip J. Mikula, had twists, ups and downs and one could not pinpoint the direction the music was to take at any given point. The conclusion of this piece ended the evening on a perfect note, containing bits and pieces of every prior song.

The talent witnessed on stage Tuesday evening was striking and relentless. Students included Michelle Calvo, Zachary Eldridge, Teresa Flores, Ashley Vorsteg, Jennifer Perez and Raul Perez. Alumni members included Brandon Cruz, Felipe Diaz, Dennis Llinas and Adam Martinez.  

It is undeniable that each musician possessed outstanding talent and passion for musicianship.  Watching them perform with acute concentration and stamina, begged the question: "How did they do that?"  

The listener could easily sense that timing was everything throughout the ensemble. 

Never lagging behind or skipping a beat, the players were quite alert and precise. 

It was obvious they knew their instruments well and anticipated every move and note necessary. To watch them perform was truly fascinating.  

One does not need to be musically inclined or very learned in the area to know that Tuesday evening's performance was music at its best. 

More performances showcasing the remaining ensembles will be taking place from now until June 5 in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center.

&nbsp;
1. Stephin Merritt
As the frontman for several successful lo-fi indie pop bands, including The Magnetic Fields, The 6ths, The Gothic Archies and The Future Bible Heroes, Merrit is the golden boy of bands that start with "the." His witty lyrics and distinct monotone never fail to put me in a good mood.

2. David Sedaris
You don't have the most screwed up family/boyfriend/job ever. David Sedaris does. Sedaris has it worse than you do, and in his collections of autobiographical stories, he'll tell you exactly why - in hilarious detail.

3. The Boondocks
Aaron McGruder's weekly comic strip, which focuses on a group of African American kids growing up in white suburbia,  is constantly pulled from papers for satirizing controversial subjects such as terrorism and drugs - proof it's the only funny strip left.

4. Cold Stone Creamery
This place makes the best ice cream! It's crazy combinations of toppings and flavors, like Our Strawberry Blonde and Candy Land, make my mouth smile and my tummy dance.

5. "The Last Kiss" ("L'Ultimo Bacio")
This Italian film weaves together the stories of couples trying to navigate love and fidelity. The acting is wonderfully honest, and it has one of the best, most believable endings I've seen in a long time.

&nbsp;
The spirit of the '60s came alive as "Hair: The Musical" debuted at the Wertheim Center of the Performing Arts on Apr. 7.

As the last production of the University Park Theatre and Dance department's season, it was apparent that a lot of time and effort was placed in making the "love-rock musical" authentic and effectively lighthearted while thought provoking. This was accomplished most of the time.

"Hair" takes place during the Vietnam War and follows a group of hippies as they get high, make love and party. Claude (Aaron Millis), a young man from Oklahoma, has just moved into New York; he befriends a group of hippies and soon finds himself in the middle of the 1960's peace movement. But when Claude receives a draft letter in the mail, he knows that it's only a matter of time before the government sends him to Vietnam.

Unfortunately, audio problems made the plot difficult to follow, especially in the first half of the play. 

While the chemistry felt solid, the miscommunication between the cast and the musical ensemble accompanying it led to some of the lowest points in the musical. Even in the title song, it took nearly an entire verse for the actors and musicians to get in sync. More audio malfunctions plagued the play. Accompaniment was either too loud or too soft; one actor's voice blaring or a soloist's voice barely audible. 

The choreography of the musical numbers was also ineffective. While in theory it was elaborate and playful, its execution its was unintentionally chaotic. All the frantic energy of the opening acts only added to the confusion. However, many of these problems can be attributed to the fact that it was the opening night performance. 

While performances were uneven at best, there were some wonderful moments in which the cast showed its strength as a unit. This was shown with the strong opening number "Age of Aquarius,"  "Let the Sunshine" and its somber reprise at the end of the show.

There were also standout personal performances from Millis as a confused and scared draft-dodger; Jonathan Gonzalez and Carlos "Casper" Machado as sexually charged comic relief.  Sentell Mcdonald also provided some of the better and more soulful vocals.

The excellent costumes and stage design perfectly reflected the fashion and the feel of the era. Bell bottoms, headbands, halter tops and bare feet were in no short supply. The stage looked like a sort of mock playground. A tire swing hung off to the side of the stage, while a carousal spun in the middle. The actors effectively used the playground-like stage to convey the playful innocence of youth. 

As the cast sang, "Let the Sunshine," the lights turned unbelievably bright and blinded the audience. The amazing lighting was particularly effective at making the stage incredibly dynamic.

In the second act, energy resurfaced and characters became more believable. The thoughtful yet blank stares of the cast in "Where Do I Go?" truly expressed a sense of longing for organization within chaos - a sentiment that many college students feel - making "Hair" a good choice of material for a college theatre department.

Ultimately, the powerful ending essentially showed the true talent of the cast and their dedication to the production. Not to mention "Let the Sunshine" is a hell of a catchy song.

Headline: Pines Center students celebrate with cruise
Author: Michael Haines / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This year's annual spring event sponsored by the Broward-Pines Student Government Association brought together FIU students, alumni, employees and their guests on a Vegas-style casino cruise April 2. 

The cruise departed from the Broward County Courthouse on a trip along the New River in Ft. Lauderdale.

The casino opened its doors as the cruise left port. Games included fake gambling such as craps, blackjack, Texas hold 'em poker and roulette. Broward County recently voted to allow slots in its pari-mutuel facilities, but there were none on this cruise. 

Everyone onboard received a voucher for $5,000 worth of chips. People with the most chips were awarded first, second and third place prizes.

Those who were not interested in gambling were entertained by the views of the houses along the New River and the Intracoastal Waterway. 

The people in attendance savored an array of appetizers including coconut shrimp and Beef Wellington. For dinner, guests were served teriyaki chicken, tri-color tortellini in a tomato basil sauce, sides of medley of rice and green beans and a salad.

Food was displayed and served everywhere on board.

"We definitely weren't going to go hungry," said Karen Jensen, of the wide variety and amounts of foods on the cruise.

Tickets for Muvico Theaters and Flamingo Gardens, calculators and airboat rides were raffled.

For Janet Fisher, guest of an FIU student, preferred a chocolate mousse layer cake over a prize she won.

"I've got to go downstairs and eat my dessert," she said, instead of checking the contents of the gift pack she won in the raffle.

The announcement of the top three gamblers capped off the evening. 

Guest Merrick Kalan took the grand prize of a two-night stay at a Marriott hotel along with his incredible $163,000 in winnings which came from playing roulette most of the night.

Ivy Siegel, a campus life employee, helped arrange the event. According to Siegel, the cruise guests reflected the students of the Broward-Pines Center campus, a slightly older group with a median age of 30.

"We attract an older, working student body," said Siegel, of the Pines Center, which offers mostly morning and evening classes.

The Broward Pines Center is located on 17195 Sheridan St in Pembroke Pines. 

The center targets working adult students, who take courses in the evenings and on Saturdays.  

Approximately 2000 students are enrolled per semester. The campus offers undergraduate, graduate and professional programs.

Headline: Over 500 students cast vote, Jean-Baptiste wins presidency
Author: Ana Sanchez / BBC Editor
&nbsp;
It looks like the students at the Biscayne Bay Campus wanted to make a difference in this year's Student Government elections. 

646 students voted, opposed to less than 100 students who voted last year.   

Natkisha Jean-Baptiste was elected as the new president. She defeated Alina Balean by 172 votes. 

Lemar Linton was elected as Jean-Baptiste's vice president; at BBC candidates for president and vice president do not run as one ticket, as they do at University Park Campus. 

Last year, the BBC presidential candidate ran unopposed. Some say the reason students voted this year was the candidates improved interaction with students and promotion campaigns. 

"[We had a] bigger turnout this year. We did a better job at getting word out with flyers. The [voting] date was more visible," said Rafael Zapata, assistant director for Campus Life.

Jean-Baptiste won with a 63.31 voting percentage over Balean. Linton won with 418 votes, twice as many votes as his opponent, Casey McClendon.

"Our opponents put up a good campaign and we were surprised by the number of students that voted this year," said Linton.

Candidates held meetings with their supporters, presented their platform and interacted with students around campus to listen to their needs.

"From campaigning, I know that students here want more classes, better cafeteria food choices and extended cafeteria working hours," Linton said. "Students in housing are currently at a disadvantage because of this."

The first plan on Jean-Baptiste and Linton's agenda is to cut the number of positions in SGA to ensure a strong and stable board. 

"I don't think all of [the positions] are relevant to BBC; for instance, we have a smaller population here," Linton said. "We don't need three reps. at large, and two can do the job for the population we have here."

SGA at BBC has to work in conjunction with the SGA at University Park  to discuss issues concerning both campuses. 

Linton has already begun talking to the new UP SGA President Alex Prado and Vice President Christine Denton about changes at BBC. 

"We are very close friends - Alex, Christine and I. We were all peer advisors," Linton said.

Amanda Clegg won the representative at large position unopposed. Camilo Silva won as lower division representative.

After many attempts to contact Jean-Baptiste she would only state that she was "excited and ready for changes." 

Jean-Baptiste was not willing to participate in an interview with The Beacon regarding her victory.
