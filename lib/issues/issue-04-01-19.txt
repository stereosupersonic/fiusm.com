Headline: Strock on joining Marino
Subheadline: 'Not a whole lot of interest right now'
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the Miami Dolphins naming legend Dan Marino senior vice president of football operations this past week, speculation is floating regarding the future of FIU head football coach Don Strock.

Under his new job description, Marino is the boss of new Dolphins general manager Rick Spielman and head coach Dave Wannstedt, and will have a major role in upgrading the Dolphins - including the coaching position, where Miami has failed to reach the playoffs the past two seasons.

That and Marino's longtime friendship with Strock have led many people to wonder if Strock, who served as quarterbacks coach for the Baltimore Ravens from 1996-98, will leave FIU at some point to accept a similar coaching position with the Dolphins. But don't expect anything like that to happen anytime soon.

"[There's] not a whole lot of interest [in the NFL] right now, but never say never," a chuckling Strock said.

Strock's relationship with Marino dates back to 1983, when the two became teammates with the Dolphins and have remained close friends since. While the hiring of Marino shocked most of South Florida, Strock said he knew of Marino's desire to join the Dolphins front office for quite some time.

"He's been talking to [Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga] for the past year or two about where he could fit in and that kind of stuff. I had a feeling something might happen. He mentioned at dinner a few times that he had interests. So I felt Mr. Huizenga felt the time to do it was now," Strock said.

However, many people feel Marino is not qualified for the position, believing he was given the job as some sort of publicity stunt. When asked by a reporter if this was the case, Huizenga responded, "I take issue with that question. Just stop and think what a foolish question that was. Here's a guy that's on CBS television and on HBO. They pay him $4 jillion dollars a year to work there. He's not going to quit a job like that come here, for somebody to say that it's just a figurehead job. This is serious business here. We're trying to win. Whether you think it's serious or not, it's serious to us. And I really don't like you even suggesting it."

Strock agreed with Huizenga about Marino being capable of getting the job done successfully.

"I would never doubt him. He's gonna work as hard as he can to get it done. They doubted he could be an announcer and other things and he did that. He has a key eye for football talent. And he knows offense and defense," Strock said.

But others have even speculated that this is a short-term task for Marino, who like his buddy Strock, might one day want to get into coaching himself. 

However, Strock quickly dismissed that idea.

"No, I don't think he will coach. He has more interest in where he is right now. And because of who he is, when he calls people, they will call back," Strock said.

As for the other FIU coaches with ties to the Dolphins, it would not be unrealistic to believe that running backs coach Tony Nathan and tight ends coach Bruce Hardy, who both played with Marino and Strock in Miami, might one day be contacted about a return to the NFL. Nathan was already an assistant coach with the Dolphins from 1988-95.

But Strock insists that his commitment is with FIU right now, where the Golden Panthers are in the beginning stages of recruiting after a disappointing 2-10 season. 

Only in the second weekend of recruiting, FIU has already landed a number of players.

"It's going fine. We have some commitments that we are not allowed to reveal yet, but we are pleased with the progress we have made so far. I think we're doing a fine job." 

Added Strock: "Right now I'm geared on getting this thing where it's supposed to be."

Headline: Matias hoping his playing days at FIU aren't gone for good
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Growing up in Santo Domingo, all Junior Matias ever wanted to do was play basketball.  Since he was 10 years old, he would run over to the nearest court and play pick up games against other kids from the barrio. 	

Fast forward 13 years and Matias is in the sixth game of his senior season against Miami, when he feels an extremely bothersome pain in his lower back. 

This terrible pain will sideline him for the rest of the season and possibly, his career here at FIU. 

After playing last season and stabilizing himself as a leader on the Golden Panther team, Matias had high hopes for this season.

Until the incident put them on hold.

The bad news hurt the team, but more importantly, felt like a stab in the heart for Matias because being a senior, this was his last chance.

"I take this very hard because it's my senior year and I wanted to do my best to play hard every night; I didn't know when it would be my last game," Matias said.

The pain at the Miami game was one Matias had never felt before and one he never wants to feel again. 

"It all began with back problems, but throughout the game, I could not even tie my shoes. I finished the game with a patch playing through pain," said Matias, who, by the end of the game, could not feel his toes.

The next day was worse for Matias. 

No longer could he walk like before and running was not even an option anymore. 

The nerve running from his back to his feet was bothering him, to the point where he felt nearly no sensation in his left leg, left foot and lower back. 

It was at this point that he knew it was time to call it quits for the season.

"It hard when you sit out there and you can't go out and help your team win," said Matias, who was averaging 14.8 points and 6.5 rebounds a game.

This past year, Matias played for the Dominican National Team. He represented his country along side childhood and FIU teammate Carlos Morban.

"It feels really good to play for your country; it will always be special for me," said Matias.

Matias will now undergo surgery within the next few weeks. 

The surgery will require cutting part of his inured disk - a nerve that is currently shaped like "a big, flat doughnut," according to Matias. However, it is not a 100 percent guarantee that Matias will return to his old form after the surgery.

"We don't know what will happen but I hope I can play like before. For the doctor, this surgery may be simple but for us it sounds complicated," said Matias, who will have full body anesthesia. 

Gratefully, Matias, who's a first-generation player, has his relatives supporting his every move.

"If I had to play in Atlanta, they will drive all day and back just to see me play that one night," said Matias.

Here at FIU, Matias learned a lot from head coach Donnie Marsh, who helped Matias understand the game from a different perspective.

"Coach helped me understand to let the game come to me. Before, it was all about me scoring.  Now it's different; if I can't shoot, I will rebound, draw an offensive foul, or pass the ball," said Matias, who now fully understands that there's a lot to do on the court besides scoring.

After competing in only six games this season, Matias will seek a redshirt season, allowing him to come back as a fifth year senior next season. 

The chances are slim but Matias still sees basketball in his future.

"I would like to come back next season to play a full senior year because you only live that once in your lifetime," said Matias.

If Matias doesn't come back, his goal would be to play in Europe for the love of the game.

"I would love to play overseas. I just love basketball and if my body lets me, I will play," said Matias. 

If Matias doesn't get that chance of playing overseas, he will still have his studies to fall back on.

"If my body tells me I can't go on I will always have my liberal studies degree. If something goes wrong, school is like an insurance," said Matias, who needs one more semester to graduate.

For now, all Matias can do is wait and hope his body returns to normal. 

But what's most important to him and his family is his health; basketball comes second.

And whether he plays again at FIU or not, he has definitely left a mark as one of the toughest, most talented players to play Golden Panther basketball.

"Junior has been the heart and soul of the team," Marsh said. 

We will miss his intensity, toughness and work ethic. The thing I always liked about Junior was that when [his] team needed [him] at any time, he would [be there]. Whether it was a shot, he would make it... a big rebound at his 6-1 frame, he would get it for you. He always found a way to make that play for you to help your team win the game."

Headline: FIU overcomes chilly weather, wins four individual titles in final home swim meet
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers didn't let a day of temperatures in the mid-60's cool them down in their final home swim meet of the season, winning four individual titles at the FIU Invitational at the Bay Vista Aquatics Center on Jan. 11.

Freshmen Claudia Barsi and Viktoria Molnar led FIU, each conquering a pair of events against competitors from Brown, Cleveland State, Houston and North Florida.

Barsi dominated the 1,000-yard freestyle, finishing nearly 13 seconds ahead of second place Bridgette Cahill of Brown with a time of 10:27.86. She also won the 500-yard freestyle by more than six seconds at 5:09.39.

Molnar defeated Brown's Becky Kowalsky by one-hundredth of a second to win the 200-yard freestyle (1:55.31). Molnar won another one-hundredth of a second victory in the 100-yard butterfly, edging out Szintia Szantoof of Houston with a time of 58.97. She suffered a tough break, however, falling 89-hundredths of a second shy of first place in the 200-yard freestyle.

Diver Megan Balkenbush earned second place honors in the one-meter (258.10) and the three-meter (247.15) to lead FIU in those competitions.

Kate Van Houten finished fifth in the 500-yard freestyle (5:16.48) and Carly Crandall finished seventh in the 50-yard freestyle (25.79) for FIU. The Golden Panthers will compete next against FAU and Indian River Community College on Jan. 24.

Headline: Men's soccer holding tryouts for FIU students
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The FIU men's soccer program will be hosting an open tryout for all full-time FIU students on Friday, Jan. 23 at 12:30 p.m. at the University Park soccer field.

The annual tryout gives head coach Karl Kremser and his staff an opportunity to evaluate all talent within the FIU student body.

"We hold [a tryout] once a year. We just want to give the student body an opportunity to come and try out. You don't know who's out there that can play," Kremser said. "We don't want anybody to say, 'I never got the opportunity to play soccer at FIU'...so that's why we do this."

Interested students are urged to participate, but must supply their own gear and be ready to practice.

Kremser is hopeful he can find additional talent to add to the FIU roster. The Golden Panthers reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament in November and finished the season 14-5-3.

 "Not many students make it, but you never know...you never know," Kremser said.

Headline: Third time's the charm?
Subheadline: Senior pitcher Andrew Edwards prepares to put the past two injury-riddled years behind him and show FIU fans that he is healthy and ready to dominate.
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Standing 6-5 and carrying 220 pounds of muscle, Andrew Edwards is entering his third season on the Golden Panthers baseball roster.  Sitting on a bench in his casual, grey mesh shorts and white T-shirt, the New York native and star pitcher never dreamed he would be hitting the mound in Miami, let alone given the chance to play pro baseball before he even walked a stage to receive a degree.  

"I have been playing baseball since I was eight years old," Edwards says with a smile from ear to ear. "I played everyday that I could."

Growing up with a love for sports, as well as a father for a coach, Andrew always knew he would spend his life as an athlete. 

He grew up in a city where baseball was too popular to have just one professional team and still remains that way today with the Yankees and Mets.

"The New York Mets were my favorite baseball team growing up," Edwards said. "Ever since I watched [ex-Mets pitcher] Dwight Gooden pitch, I too wanted to become a great pitcher," said Edwards.

Despite excelling at every infield position whether it was first base or third base, Andrew felt a growing passion to remain a pitcher. 

Edwards knew this would be possible due to strong support from his family, particularly his mother - the person he refers to as his role model.

"I love my mother," Edwards says proudly. "We have a great bond together."  

His mother acted as a conscience for Andrew, helping him to put his education before his talents. 

"She always wanted me to get my degree first and so do I," said Edwards.

After completing an undefeated season 33-0 and winning the junior varsity championship in high school, Edwards was well on his way to a prominent future in baseball. When Andrew was in 10th grade, he had already hit the spotlight as an All-Region selection in baseball.  He was later drafted by the San Francisco Giants, but returned home college-bound instead.  

"There are not many people out there that have a college degree and play pro baseball," said Edwards.  

Ready to take on a new challenge, Andrew returned to school near his home where he could still stand out. 

He posted a 9-3 record with a 3.50 ERA his sophomore year at Briarcliffe College in Long Island, New York.  

With a great reputation among the baseball elite after only two years there, he received an invitation from FIU pitching coach Mark Calvi to join the Golden Panthers.

"After meeting Coach Calvi, I wanted nothing more then to be on his team," said Edwards. "I still thank him almost everyday for bringing me here."

As the team's premier recruit in 2002, Edwards headed to Miami with hopes of being the ace of the FIU pitching staff. 

But before he could even showcase his skills, injuries clouded his opportunity. In his first game, only four innings down against UCF, Edwards threw out his right elbow and ended what could have been a rewarding season. Stuck with only a surgery date to look forward to, Edwards underwent "Tommy John" surgery and prepared for a long recovery.  

Despite having such a short year, Edwards was drafted in the 41st round by the Seattle Mariners. Not letting go of his dreams of a degree, he returned to FIU for a second try. 

"I knew I had more in me," said Edwards. "I felt like I could benefit my team."  

Andrew spent the rest of the year recuperating, while anticipating another hopeful season.  

"I kind of rushed myself during my recovery," Edwards said, with a weary grin on his face. He returned in March of 2003 to take another stab on the hill. 

"It felt great to be back on the mound playing the game again," said Edwards.  

During Edwards' second year as a starting pitcher, he struck out a season-high seven batters in four innings against Western Kentucky and posted a 4.37 ERA, but before having any more chances to shine, he heard the knocking once again. 

He hurt his right shoulder against South Alabama in April and was out for yet another season. Asked what words were going through his mind at that moment, Edwards responds calmly: "Not again."

Edwards spent the rest of the year rehabbing and when the annual MLB Draft rolled around, Edwards was drafted again, this time by his hometown Yankees in the 27th round. But instead of going pro, Edwards decided to return to FIU for his senior season.

"Nobody even got to see my full potential yet, so I decided to go back to FIU," Edwards said.

Now in 2004, Edwards has one last chance to show the baseball world what he was brought here to do. 

Edwards believes the injuries are behind him and after two tough seasons, he feels this will be the best one.

When he's not practicing six days a week or at study hall, Edwards is in the weight room, working out his arm constantly. After having lightning strike twice and still having the fortune to get drafted both years, Edwards does not want to deal with the bad luck again. However, he knows he has good luck on his side to even be able to come back from two devastating injuires.

"It truly is a blessing in disguise to still be here," Edwards said.  

With Edwards healthy and being one of oldest players on the team, he will be counted on to lead an inexperienced FIU unit. Despite losing a number of key players from last year's squad, he believes the atmosphere is the best it's ever been.

"I have never been on team like this before," Edwards says with that amazing grin appearing again. "This team has so much love for one another, it stuns me everyday."

But when his FIU days are over, Edwards will have a solid foundation - even if his pro baseball career never pans out.

The senior who majored in Liberal Studies received an Associate of Arts Degree in New York and currently holds a passion for the business world.  

"I would love to open my own business some day," he said. 

But sitting relaxed, clicking a black pen in his right hand as if he is about to hit the books, Edwards goes right back to talking about baseball.

"I would love to be a business man, but I want the chance to play pro baseball first," Edwards said.

When FIU head coach Danny Price says "Andrew has yet to play a season on this team," he is absolutely correct. 

But while Edwards was absent physically, he feels his heart has always been with this team. 

"I feel like I have been playing on this team all along," Edwards said. "The sky's the limit," he said reassuringly, "I am ready to play."

When the season kicks off in just a few short weeks, FIU will get to see if Edwards is right.

Headline: Men's basketball's struggles attributed to lack of teamwork
Subheadline: COMMENTARY
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It hasn't been the year head coach Donnie Marsh, his team, or anybody else involved with the FIU men's basketball program for that matter expected. With a top recruiting class that includes guards Marcus Robinson, Harry Lum, center Byron Burnett, the return of forward Taurance Johnson from suspension and veteran leaders Carlos Morban and Junior Matias, there where high hopes for this team after struggling last season with only one victory in the Sun Belt Conference.

With the Golden Panthers (3-11, 0-2 SBC) now halfway through their season, the team's woes from last season have yet to go away. The team has been struggling and all eyes are focusing on Marsh who has posted a disappointing 29-73 record here at FIU over a span of four seasons. 

With online message boards and talks over the radio suggesting that Marsh be fired, people are blaming the coach for all of the team's troubles - something that is wrong. Yes, Marsh's record is 44 games under .500 but at the end of the day, the players should look at themselves in the mirror and question their play, potential and role on the team.

The schedule began this season with two exhibition victories in which the team played well and got fans excited entering the regular season. Since, the team has not had good fortune. Matias, the team's heart and soul last year was lost for the season with a back injury. Injuries, like the one suffered by Matias, and some tough breaks like the team suffered against FAU, have derailed this team with conference play ready to heat up.

However, bad fortune is not to blame for what is going on. Every team deals with injuries. FIU's struggles are occurring because of poor execution on the court. FIU's free throw shooting and turnovers have been awful. Out of 290 free throws, the team has only made 170, good for only 61 percent. Four players are shooting 50 percent or lower from the line. These statistics are unacceptable for a team playing in Division I. 

The Golden Panthers have also struggled against teams applying full court pressure. Opponents exploit this weakness and by the time FIU finds a way to counter it, they're usually too far behind, too late. FIU is averaging 19.1 turnovers compared to only 9.7 assists per game. Troy State guard Greg Davis averages 9.7 assists per game alone.

Besides that, FIU plays very selfish at times. Many of the players have been the scoring leaders for their past teams, but have struggled with a new role at FIU. 

There have been games when FIU has been down by seven or eight points and players begin taking wild three pointers and other low percentage shots when they are completely covered. Instead of driving it the basket for high percentage shots or creating penetration for open teammates, players turn games into one-on-one situations. It seems like the team has yet to establish an identity and is failing because of it. Marsh himself has even spoken about selfish play on more than one occasion this season.

However, despite the team's struggles, there is still time to turn the negative into a positive. Marsh has brought some talented recruiting classes. This year's class was even recognized as one of the best on ESPN  The Magazine. 

FIU's defense has also been solid for the most part. The team is averaging 7.2 steals per game and is averaging more than three blocks. The defense has bailed out the offense all year.

And new players on this year's squad have added sparks to the team. Lum has gone from sixth man to a starter with two 20-point games under his belt. Robinson has added a real threat on the offensive side of the ball, where he attracts opposing teams to constant double teams throughout the game. Burnett has been another offensive option as of late and has thrived as a top post player in the Sun Belt Conference.

The return of Johnson has added a blocking presence in the middle and Morban has done a solid job playing the two-guard and has been FIU's most consistent scorer.

But the team has had trouble running a new offense this year. FIU is running a much more up-tempo scheme instead of the half-court offense they ran a year ago. With the addition of athletic well-rounded players, Marsh has developed a faster pace through Morban, Robinson, Lum and Johnson. All four play tough defense, which creates turnovers leading to fast break points. The only problem is that the Golden Panthers do not finish often enough and when the opportunity for a three-point play arrives, FIU misses the finishing free throw too often.

To his credit, Marsh has not been the yelling coach that takes out his frustration on his players. According to players, he always maintains a positive approach and shifts the focus to how the team can improve. Marsh, along with his staff has also made player transitions smooth. He has been a father-like figure for many players, like Robinson, who are away from home.

But Marsh is a defensive minded coach who holds the belief that hard, tough defense wins you ball games. This is what Athletic Director Rick Mello has liked about Marsh. Being defensive minded is great, but Marsh desperately needs to find a way to improve this team offensively. No matter how you look at it, you have to score more points than your opponent and FIU has struggled to keep up. 

However, the bottom line is that FIU has not been successful in terms of winning for years now and it is Marsh's job, being the head coach, to turn this team into a winner.

Mello has said that when the season ends, he will evaluate where the team is at and go from there, but has not said whether or not Marsh will be back next season.

"We are very appreciative of his [Marsh] philosophy and how he's built this program and at the end of the year we will do an evaluation of the program. I am not going to do an ongoing commentary as to the evaluation of the program until the end of the season," Mello said. 

	

But in defending Marsh, Mello realizes the bad luck the team has faced through the years under Marsh.

"We have been the beneficiary of real bad luck, relating to injuries and it has cost us through the past couple of years. Major injuries and losing kids to them is difficult for the team chemistry," Mello said.

But before we start getting carried away here, there is still time this season to turn things around. There are still over 10 Sun Belt Conference games remaining giving FIU a chance to win the conference and make the NCAA Tournament.

This team needs to forget about the injuries and come together - now. Pat Riley once said, "Teamwork is the essence of life. If there's one thing on which I'm an authority, it's how to blend the talents and strengths of individuals into a force that becomes greater than the sum of its part." This is the time for FIU to do this, to make a breakthrough that will define its season and fulfill its fans' hopes of establishing a winning program.

Headline: Government should encourage abstinence
Author: Melissa Pardue and Robert Rector/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
The dangers of early sexual activity are well documented. It leads to higher levels of child and maternal poverty, elevates the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, and often leaves teenage girls depressed, even suicidal. It contributes to marriage failure in adulthood.

So why is the government spending 12 times more promoting so-called "safe sex" than it does encouraging people to wait?

That's the finding of a new, in-depth survey of government spending by The Heritage Foundation. In 2002 (the most recent year for which complete information is available), the federal and state governments spent at least $1.73 billion on programs that, in various ways, encourage "safe sex."

At the same time, we invested only $144.1 million in programs that encourage people to abstain.

Of course, some of the "safe sex" spending was used to provide contraception and AIDS prevention information to people in their 20s and 30s, and all of the abstinence funding was spent on teens, the group that most needs to hear the abstinence message.These spending priorities are the exact opposite of what parents want. In a recent Zogby poll, 85 percent of parents said the government's emphasis on abstinence for teens should be equal or greater than the emphasis placed on contraception. Only 8 percent said teaching teens to use condoms is more important than teaching them abstinence.

Abstinence-education programs work. Many evaluations show they can substantially reduce teen sexual activity. That's all to the good, as many social science studies link beginning sexual activity at an older age to higher levels of personal happiness in adulthood.

Unfortunately, that won't stop lawmakers from ignoring evidence and pushing for even more "safe sex" funding when Congress considers reauthorization of the 1996 welfare reform bill later this year.

Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., has already tried to abolish some $50 million in abstinence-education funding and replace it with sex-education money states could use for either safe sex or abstinence programs. Waxman's bid failed, but others are in the works. 

Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., wants $100 million per year for "comprehensive sexuality education." Sens. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., and Tom Carper, D-Del., are pushing for $50 million more to fund states' contraceptive programs. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., is also pressing for $50 million in new funding.

Worse, all of these programs, and many others, play off the popularity of abstinence education by claiming to be "abstinence plus." But in reality, they focus on the "plus" and almost entirely ignore abstinence. While more than 90 percent of parents want teens to wait until they are at least out of high school before having sex, safe sex or "abstinence plus" programs don't give that message. Many contain sexually explicit material that shocks many parents. 

For example, in the government-sponsored program "Focus on Kids," middle- and high school students are told about the joys of bathing together, watching sexually explicit movies together and reading erotic books and magazines. The "Be Proud! Be Responsible!" program promoted by the Centers for Disease Control asks teens to "think up a fantasy using condoms" then "use condoms as a method of foreplay." Kids as young as 13 are taught to "act sexy/sensual" while putting on condoms.

"Becoming a Responsible Teen," also pushed by the CDC, ironically gives students instructions that are likely to make them behave irresponsibly. The program has teens practice putting a condom on a plastic phallus and encourages them to scrounge around the house for a sexual lubricant. "B.A.R.T." helpfully suggests grape jelly, maple syrup and honey.

We're putting our money in the wrong place. Instead of investing in contraception and sexual education programs that send the wrong message to teens, we ought to spend more encouraging those teens to wait until they're older to have sex. After all, when they do, the news is better for them - and for us.

Headline: With Bush's lies, truth in America is paradox
Author: Ted Randall/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
In the Marine Corps, moral and ethical behavior is stressed as an integral part of one's character. As a Marine, I learned about Corps values such as honor, courage and commitment. One of the most important tenets I learned was that a Marine never lies. 

Apparently, some people have not learned this simple rule. In fact it seems that America's entire corporate culture, the very culture we are supposed to admire and emulate, is corrupt. Lying is now an innate skill required of all CFOs, CEOs, even the president of the United States. Whether it is cooking the books at Enron, misleading the Federal Trade Commision in quarterly profits, lying about infidelity, or sending America into an infinitely costly war, lying has become prototypical. The very Marines who are taught at boot camp about integrity are dying for a commander and chief who has none. 

Truth is a paradox. It is subjective. It is what I think it is or rather what AOL/Time Warner, GE, Sony and the rest of the media conglomerates tell me it is. If the corporate media is nothing but a conduit used to promote the agendas of those in power, then its integrity is suspect too. In a democracy, if lies prevail then what about the truth? 

America's War on Terrorism has validated Aeschylus' statement that "In war, truth is the first casualty." In this new war, lies have become the norm. Long before Bush declared that an invasion of Iraq was necessary to protect America, his administration had disclosed the U.S. strategic policy on Iraq as a regime change. Running roughshod, untouchable, Bush and his cronies spun their deceptions, mislead congress, lied to America and got what they wanted. They fabricated information even the CIA could not corroborate. 

Citing weapons of mass destruction, Saddam's purported lack of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, Iraq's direct link to the attacks of 9/11, Bush deceived congress and the American people. 

The lies he spun went unchallenged by congress and the media. That is treasonous. Teddy Roosevelt said, "To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public." Sadly, lies continuously repeated and unchallenged soon become the truth.

In "Mein Kampf," Hitler wrote, "By means of shrewd lies, unremittingly repeated, it is possible to make people believe that heaven is hell - and hell heaven. The greater the lie, the more readily it will be believed." 

Mr. Bush lied about the reasons for invading and with tremendous temerity he has since redefined those reasons, which are also lies. He has basically self prophesized just as Eric Hoffer said people in power can do: "Those in possession of absolute power can not only prophesy and make their prophecies come true, they can also lie and make their lies come true." 

No one can argue that the Iraqi people weren't living under a regime of oppression and cruelty, but a great many nations around the globe live under these conditions, many of whom are supported by the United States, including the infamous Mr. Hussien. Donald Rumsfeld was Reagan's envoy to the Middle East in the '80s. Apparently chemical weapons used then, although not favored by the United States, were tolerable if it gave Mr. Hussein an edge over Iran. 

Perhaps Pascal was right that "We like to be deceived." After almost a year of ground operations there have been no mass caches of WMD's discovered. No evidence ever submitted to the American people regarding a Saddam/Al-Qaeda conspiracy. 

What has happened is more than 450 American service men and women have died and more than 2,000 have been wounded in combat. Close to 7,000 service members have been medically evacuated from Iraq for various medical reasons including combat fatigue. Possibly as many as 15,000 Iraqi civilians may have died as a result of the invasion - no, sorry, the liberation of Iraq.

By redefining the invasion as an act of liberation, Bush has diverted attention from the scandalous lies he has emitted. It sickens me that American service men and women will die under a veil of lies and deceit designed to execute Bush's private neo-conservative agenda and to protect the private interests of Halliburton and ExxonMobile. 

It does not matter what is the "truth," but  what the consequences are for believing in a particular "truth." One thing maybe certain, if we continue to accept Bush's lies and accept his "truth" then we will lose more lives, kill more innocent people, and continue to alienate the peoples of the world against us. Perhaps Chekhov best understood truth's paradox "They say that in the end truth will triumph, but it's a lie."

Headline: Editorial: Broward school board policy doesn't infringe on free speech
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Flanagan Senior High School student Christine Curran is filing a lawsuit against the Broward County School Board seeking to change school policies. Her attempts are misguided.

The lawsuit stems from Curran's run-in with administrators at Driftwood Middle - where she attended school last year - when she attempted to pass out flyers to students and was reprimanded. The flyers promoted a church youth group conference. 

Curran believes that administrators' threats to penalize her if she continued to pass out the flyers infringed on her first amendment right to free speech.

But that isn't the case.

The Broward County School Board points out that the board does not allow students to pass out materials - be they surveys, flyers, or petitions - on school grounds without approval. They point out that they have a responsibility to protect students.

Curran and the Liberty Counsel - a group that litigates for religious rights and is representing her - should be aware of the precedent that they might set through a change in this policy.

There is a first amendment right to free speech, and on a college campus - where students are adults - there should be no restrictions on those liberties.

But on a middle school or high school campus, a certain amount of vigilance should be exercised by administrators to protect students from inappropriate materials.

A change in that policy would open the way for anyone to distribute anything on school grounds under the guise of free speech. Pornography, cult literature, hate literature, and other questionable material that parents and educators should seek to protect impressionable children from could potentially find their way into the hands of students.

Some may argue that some things, such as the flyers Curran sought to distribute, are reasonable and should be exempt. But where does one draw the line? In landmark court rulings, films like "Deep Throat," were legally found to be not obscene, though risqué.

The bottom line is that the school board had measures in place that would screen materials for propriety. All that Curran had to do was clear her flyers with administrators.

If indeed those flyers were appropriate, she should have been allowed to distribute them. But she didn't follow procedures.

The policy works and shouldn't be changed.

Headline: It's time to settle down in S. Florida
Author: John Colagrande Jr./Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
For the first time in my life I feel at home in Florida. 

I've lived in South Florida, for eight of my 28 years, three in Dade, and five in Broward. I never felt at home here. 

Along with Las Vegas, South Florida is probably the most transient locale in the United States - it's hard to feel at home in a place that is constantly in flux. 

Florida has always seemed like a vacation to me. There has always been a part of me that felt like I was either on vacation, or retired from a life I hadn't yet lived. 

When I lived in Miami, I felt disconnected from the Latino culture - like an outsider - like an apple in a crate of oranges. I felt like a tourist. 

Living in Broward was a whole other vibe. 

To me Broward County is to New York like Australia was to England - a place to send its dysfunctional society members. I lived in New York until I was 17; living in Broward I felt either exiled from New York or trapped in a suburban jail. 

I never, ever, ever, felt at home in Florida.

I would use Florida as a base. I'd travel some place far then return to home base, work some remedial job, save money, get some college done, and dip out again on some adventure. 

I desire to write for a living so I travel a lot to generate ideas and experiences. During this last winter break I hitched a one-way ride to California. 

On the trip something in me changed. My experience cup was full. I didn't need to wander anymore. I wanted to nest. 

When I returned to Florida the landscape glowed with familiarity. The sun seemed to wave good bye as it set. The trees waved, "Hello, Jay Jay," when I drove by them. 

The moon winked good night to me. The Florida landscape, like a lover returning from a trip, seemed to ask, "Did you miss me?" And my heart and my mind were in agreement: "Yeah, I did miss ya, baby."

Last week, I bought an old convertible. Driving around with the top down for the first time filled me with an amazing feeling of complacency - I was just all smiles - if I were a girl you could've called me April Giggles or Giggly Gigglesome. I was happy to be in Florida. Like a South Beach surfer on Third Street during a sudden groundswell - an event that happens a handful of times a year - I was stoked, brah. 

Feeling at home is such a strong experience - so strong I'm compelled to explore it here. 

Feeling at home - it's more than security, more than fitting in and being comfortable. It's joy. Simple Zen-like joy. And it's spiritual; home is a form of Zion, forget the form, home is Zion. Granted, this is January and this is best time to be in Florida. But I don't think this sense of feeling at home is going to fade - I'm looking into buying an apartment and I got a gig writing for Street. 

Even though South Florida is definitely wacky - to say the least - I think Florida's future will be as bright as its sunny winter days. 

And it's a good feeling knowing you are where you want to be.

Headline: MLK Jr. legacy lives on at FIU
Subheadline: Events honor charismatic civil rights leader
Author: Lashonne Outten/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In commemoration of the late Martin Luther King Jr., many organizations at FIU got together to plan a week of events that were all dedicated to keeping King's legacy alive.

 King is best known for his 'I Have a Dream' speech and his active role as a non-violent crusader for equal rights.  

Many Americans and admirers of  King, considered him to be an eloquent speaker, who used his extraordinary gift as a charismatic leader to send a strong message across the nation, a message that urged people of all races to take a stand for peace, equal justice and social equality. 

 King is not only accredited with being a major figure in the struggle for the plight of African-Americans during the gloomy days of the civil rights era, but is also recognized for his part in addressing the issues of minorities all across the nation and the world.

 The assassination of  Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 left the world in a state of disbelief. 

King's untimely death made it impossible for him to see his dreams come into being, but for those that were a part of  King's social equality struggle during his lifetime, and lived long after his death; for new generations to come,  King's dream will be their reality.

 Jan. 19 is a day that has been set aside for tribute to, some might say, one of the greatest Americans to have contributed so much, to so many, in so little time.  

 Martin Luther King Jr. holiday is a time for people from all walks of life to join hands, and show appreciation for an integrated society that is still striving to reach a state of what King called 'Brotherhood.' 

The commemorative celebration of 2004 proved that FIU and its organizations made an exemplary effort at showing their appreciation for King.

 Several organizations at FIU collaborated to hold  week long events in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr.. 

The events were organized with one central theme in mind,  'The Legacy: Reaching Beyond His Dream.'

 Multicultural Programs and Services kicked of the weeks activities with the 'M.L.K. Youth Forum and Peace Walk' at the Biscayne Bay Campus.  
The keynote speaker, Bakari Kitwana spoke to the audience  about the politics of  hip-hop and youth culture.  The peace walk that took place after the forum was symbolic for the need for peace and unity for people of all nations.

 Floetry In Motion, another event  sponsored by MPAS, took place at the Graham Center forum at University Park, with a special performance by the Exclusive Dancers.

 Another organization responsible for arranging events to commemorate King is the Black Student Union.  

They held a dinner at the first floor lounge of Panther Hall, under the banner, the M.L.K. Fellowship Dinner.

 MPAS is responsible for organizing and sponsoring one of the most celebrated events at FIU, an event called the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Breakfast, now in its 13th year. 

 The  coordinator of MPAS and Student Support Services Program, Jeffrey McNamee said, "We would like to commemorate a man, who not only spoke of peace, but  lived it."

 The Commemorative Breakfast is held in the ballroom at the University Park campus each year.  

Faculty, students and special guests look forward to this Commemorative Breakfast, as an event that aspires to inspire its attendees each year.

 Keynote speaker at the breakfast,  Myrlie Evers- Williams, chairwoman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and widow of Mississippi's state field director for the NAACP, Medgar Evers, who was shot to death on their lawn, made a simple but humbling address to the audience.   

 Before leaving the breakfast, in an intimate discussion   Evers- Williams said, "I am blessed to have been a part of the civil rights movement and to have lived long enough to see positive changes, yet there is still so much to do towards making our society one of equality."

Carol Boyce-Davies,  Director of the African New World Studies program,  added that she supports the Commemorative Breakfast because, "It is a day to celebrate the achievements as it refers to civil rights and black power, but also it is a day to think about the realities of black people, not only in the U.S., but also in the world."

 Another major event that took place in commemoration of  Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy was the Martin Luther King Jam Celebration, which was co-sponsored by the Black Student Union and Delta Sigma Theta.

 The Jam  had a large turnout of students, as the party-goers danced the night away, the M.L.K. Jam proved to be successful.

 Sanetta Guyton, a senior majoring in M.I.S. and human resource management said, "As a member of Delta Sigma Theta, I feel great to be able to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King's memory along with other predominantly black organizations.''

 A vigil, which is sponsored by the Black Student Union and Sigma Gamma Rho, called the M.L.K. Vigil, has been scheduled to take place on Jan. 19, at UP.

 The Commemorative Celebration 2004, held under the theme 'The Legacy: Reaching Beyond His Dream' is a testament to King's legacy still being alive.

Headline: Alegria visits Miami
Author: Venus Goicoechea / Business Manager
&nbsp;
Cirque du Soleil's "Alegria" is like no other show in the world. it's about as far from your typical circus as you can get.

Cirque du Soleil, (which literally translated means Circus of the Sun), is an internationally-based performance ensemble that uniquely blends traditional circus arts with the expressive possibilities of theatre, dance and music. 

The show is made up of extravagant and inventive costumes, beautiful scores of music from all over the world and, above all, acts that leave the audience wondering: "How can they do that?"

 "Alegria" is the vision of Franco Dragone. His imagination has captivated audiences all over the world through its various representations of the circus experience. 

This spectacle features performers dressed as jokers, minstrels, beggars, old aristocrats and children. 

Along with the clowns who play with the audience, these create a universe that encompasses the origins of circus life.

Each performance shows the ability of the human body to reach its limits and how each of us possesses the power to create joy and awe. The performances range from balancing acts to aerial bars.

 One of the acts feature an extremely flexible girl who starts dancing with a ribbon and ends up being able to control five hula hoops on different parts of her body simultaneously. She also has the ability to contort her body and at the same time control one hula-hoop on her foot. 

One of the more impressive acts feature a group of trapezists that seem to defy the laws of gravity with their synchronized maneuvers and aerial feats. 

The act with the Russian bars seems to be the most difficult. 

Acrobatic flyers are thrown into the air to perform twist and turns and land on a flexible three inch wide, six-foot pole held on both ends by strong catchers. 

The act that mostly represents the old world circus is the strong man who can lift unbelievable weights and bend metal bars with his neck. 

One act that seemed almost too dangerous was a man who played with fire batons while dancing to the beat of a drum as he intertwined the batons around his body.

All these performances gave a sense of wonder and awe with a twist of the theatrical aspect of a Broadway spectacle. The music is a very strong pulse in this whole ensemble; it's heavily influenced by European rhytms, but draws from all sorts of musical traditions. The music starts off even before the show begins by involving the crowd and getting them pumped up. 

Each act has their own score that follows their performance as they feature almost impossible acts. 

All the performers need to be praised for putting together such a great show, but the ones that carried the story were the clowns. They didn't talk much but who needs to talk when actions speak louder than words? 

And in the end it's all about the laughter and emotion that is evoked on the audience.

Headline: Big names head to Utah for Sundance Festival
Author: Jami Bernard
&nbsp;
It's always cold, there's never any parking and there's no such thing as "a quick bite" at the Sundance Film Festival.  But Ashton Kutcher, Isabella Rossellini, Jane Fonda, Julianne Moore, Hilary Swank, Ben Affleck and others are headed to Park City, Utah, for Thursday's opening.

The premier showcase for new independent films, Sundance is a laid-back, mufflers-and-mittens affair, despite the bold-face names.

Moore is there with "Marie and Bruce," a dark comedy about the breakdown of a marriage. Swank's suffragette movie, "Iron Jawed Angels," will get its premiere and Nicole Kidman's "Dogville" receives a special screening. 

It's Ashton Kutcher's first time at the festival. 

In a departure from the demands of dating Demi Moore and making movies like "Dude, Where's My Car?," Kutcher stars in and executive-produces "The Butterfly Effect," about a guy who is able to go back in time to right the wrongs of his youth.

"I've never been to Sundance before," Kutcher said. "I always told myself I'm not going to go till I have a movie there. I didn't want to be there and be the guy hanging out." Now, he says, it's his chance "to be a part of a really cool thing."

If "independent" means unpredictable, creative and completely off the wall, then Guy Maddin's "The Saddest Music in the World" fits the bill.

Set in Winnipeg during the Depression, and shot as if it were a found film from someone's attic, "Saddest Music" asks which country's music can wrench the heart most effectively? Winners of preliminary rounds get tossed into a vat of beer; suds beget suds.

Tossing those winners into the drink is Isabella Rossellini as a scheming amputee who regains happiness by screwing on a pair of hollow glass legs filled with sloshing brew.

"Isabella 'got it' right away," said Maddin by phone from Winnipeg. "She even cut her own hair on the airplane on the way up here. She must have smuggled some dull children's shears onboard. She arrived a month early in a big parka and this self-administered coiffure."

There were numerous puzzled walkouts during an advance screening of "Saddest Music," which means Maddin must be on the right track - the movie is delirious and nightmarish fun, as well as social commentary.

"I've always felt more independent than the independents, because of where I am. Half the time, I get the feeling other independents wouldn't even be sympathetic to me," he says. 

"Anyway, it's my first time at Sundance - we'll be a bunch of galoots peeing in the hot tub."

Sundance has been known mostly as a boys' club, but women are making inroads, especially in the documentary competition. 

Two examples: "In the Company of Women" has such Sundance regulars as Parker Posey making wry observations about the state of the festival. "Until the Violence Stops" looks at how Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues" has morphed into a worldwide movement for social change.

Jane Fonda, another Sundance neophyte (she went last year to support a movie made by her son), will be on hand to support "Until the Violence Stops," in which she appears briefly. 

Seeing Ensler's original work Off-Broadway "had a huge impact on me," Fonda said. "I don't think I ever laughed or cried as hard in a theater."

"I cry a lot," Ensler said, "because there is so much suffering in the world.

"But I also hear enormous stories of resistance and incredible transformation. It's both disturbing and inspiring." 

Fonda hopes that the documentary will help women break their silence about abuse and violence, and even about "our willingness to set aside who we really are in order to please a man. 

The festival opens with "Riding Giants," an exhaustive history of surfing from Stacy Peralta, who made the popular skateboarding documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys."

Headline: Altman invites viewers into performers' lives
Author: Chris Vognar
&nbsp;
After all these years and all those imitators, you still can't mistake a Robert Altman film for anything else. His latest, "The Company," is a backstage immersion in the world of Chicago's Joffrey Ballet, complete with insult and injury, triumph and romance. But "The Company" is about a process, not a story. And that's what makes it a quintessential Altman production.

The idea of writing a loose script (by Barbara Turner) and giving actors room to roam and improvise is no longer particularly new. The English director Mike Leigh does it as well as anyone else, and such HBO shows as the canceled "K Street" and the thriving "Curb Your Enthusiasm" have used the approach on a weekly basis. But Altman's results still feel more free and loose than most similar endeavors. "The Company" leaves you with the constant feeling that you've just walked in on something already in progress. It keeps you on your toes, and it's done with enough thought and preparation to make you forget that there isn't much of a story.

The star is Neve Campbell, who also co-wrote the story and spent a good part of her pre-"Party of Five" days as a professional ballet dancer. She barely speaks until the film is 30 minutes old, and even then, she lets her feet do most of the talking. She plays a Joffrey member named Ry who is called upon to step into a principal role. Ry strikes up a romance with a young chef (James Franco) and proves her worth to the company's demanding director (a delightfully catty Malcolm McDowell). And that's about it.

"The Company" is a democratic affair. We see dancers packed like sardines in a small apartment, arguing with choreographers, throwing a retreat-roast, suffering serious injuries, dealing with administration, and, above all, dancing. Altman has surrounded his actors with real Joffrey members, who, not surprisingly, perform superbly. And the old master has a real instinct for shooting dance sequences - no lickety-split editing or artsy, disorienting swooping, just long and medium shots and concise, minimal camera movement that capture every movement. 

Altman has always had a knack for capturing the defining details of subcultures and social milieus - the aspirations and humiliations of "Nashville," the backstabbing Hollywood culture of "The Player," the upstairs-downstairs class and caste divisions of "Gosford Park." These films seem to capture the action as much they shape it. But "The Company" finds the filmmaker in particularly relaxed form, perhaps because he didn't know a whole lot about the dance world before he took the plunge. It's the work of a man who trusts his collaborators to fill in the blanks, allowing Altman to don the ringmaster's hat that he wears so well.

"The Company" isn't for anyone who requires a movie with a three-act story structure (or any story structure, for that matter). 

But the film offers something even more rare than a cohesive narrative. It gives you the opportunity to experience the daily lives of trained, very talented and temperamental performers. And it invites you to pull up a seat and watch them do what they do best.

Headline: Phantom Planet: California rockers step up creativity levels
Author: Krystal Alvarez
&nbsp;
A new, dark planet full of phantastic fun is the only way to describe Phantom Planet's self-titled new album. Now in stores everywhere, "Phantom Planet" is sure to win over new fans and satisfy old fans.

Even with the departure of Jason Schwartzman, the Phantom Planet boys have not lost their lovable California pop rock style. Now only five members, Alexander Greenwald, Sam Ferrar, Jaques Brautbar, Darren Robinson and Jeff Conrad, the LA band marvels in a look and sound that is a mixture of Weezer, The Monkees and The Flaming Lips.

With this new album the band decided to modify their style a tad and adopt a darker, punk-like sound. No longer are the lyrics so clear and understandable, nor has the same melodic sound from their previous album "The Guest" been regurgitated and processed into another catchy album. The band decided to dive a little deeper and find a unique sound all their own. Phantom Planet went as far as the Amish town of Fredonia, NY to experiment with innovative beats for this album. 

"Phantom Planet" will surely set them apart from their pop rock colleagues Rooney and the All-American Rejects, whose style and songs sound very similar to old Phantom Planet. As Phantom Planet's old single, "California" wins over millions of FOX's OC fans, their new single "Big Brat" is destined to make a splash with old fans. The beats and the vocals in "Big Brat" are muffled and the music is much louder and more rock and roll. Other songs like "1st things first" and "Making a killing" will excite anyone who loves looking at new bands grow. 

This is album is definitely a step up for Phantom Planet. Without compromising their style, the band has managed to develop lyrically and musically. 

Even if the songs on this album are not very infectious, they are worth listening to.

 And if their new sound doesn't entice listeners, their unique, noisy album cover will at least leave listeners wondering what else these fellows have up their sleeve.

Headline: Punk Rock Meets Politics in Middle America
Author: Matt Stearns/ Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
DES MOINES, Iowa - There was a time when punk rock was synonymous with anti-social behavior: Smashed guitars, trashed hotel rooms, behavior that would be offensive even on today's reality TV shows. A punk rock icon whose stage name was Sid Vicious allegedly killed his girlfriend in a ratty New York hotel, then died of a heroin overdose.

Today, punk rockers are talking politics in Des Moines, Iowa, which is about as deep in Middle America as you can get, as the state's Jan. 19 Democratic presidential caucuses approach.

Punk is dead. Boring won.

Some trappings of punk were evident at Punkvoter.com's "Rock Against Bush" news conference on Sunday, held at a downtown Des Moines hotel. (Vibe-wise, the place is several solar systems away from punk. It has a portrait of Woodrow Wilson in the lobby.)

One organizer wore heavy black, so-dorky-they're-cool eyeglasses. Chris No. 2, from the band Anti-Flag, ("We rock the dudes and damn the man") sported a red Mohawk and a thick chain for a belt. 

The official T-shirt showed a picture of President Bush with the word "Evil" stamped across his forehead, under the word(?) "Demockcracy."

Even so, The Man clearly has co-opted punk's glorious nihilism. Flanking Chris No. 2 was Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack (who conceded that he preferred Phil Collins) and political organizers from the United Auto Workers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. They all said they hoped to help attract young people to politics.

"I'm very glad to see punk America come along with this effort," said Dave Neil, a UAW official.

Dude?

"This is probably the weirdest thing I've ever done," allowed Chris No. 2.

It was, the punks said, all about empowerment.

"I had no one to yell at," said Billy Gould of the band Faith No More. "I could yell at my girlfriend. I could yell at my dog. I was frustrated."

And so a coalition of punk rockers founded the organization and Web site. They're also issuing a two-volume CD called "Rock Against Bush." Organizer Wayne Kramer of the band MC5 said he hopes to mobilize more than 500,000 young voters. Kramer said the site is getting 250,000 hits a day.

Voting, of course, is a relatively establishment-oriented activity, but Kramer said he saw no disconnect between punk and politics.

"Punk is to defy things you find offensive," he said.

Iraqis complain about selection process for pilgrimage

BAGHDAD, Iraq- Iraqis who had hoped to make the annual pilgrimage to the Muslim holy city of Mecca this week angrily accused politicians and religious leaders Tuesday of manipulating the lottery that selected 30,000 people for the sacred trip to Saudi Arabia.

 Entrepreneurs seized on the confusion, illegally selling their spots for up to $200 and turning Islam's most precious pilgrimage into just another post-war commodity.

Encouraged by the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi politicians promised this year to ease the former regime's restrictions on those making the hajj, the annual journey to Mecca required for able-bodied Muslims at least once in a lifetime. Organizers did away with age, sex and financial barriers and gave special privileges to the relatives of those killed by Saddam Hussein's security forces. A record number of Iraqis will depart Thursday.

Headline: Washington student contests scholarship withdrawal
Author: Nick Perry/The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
Nestled on a grassy slope in a quiet Kirkland neighborhood, Northwest College makes the modest claim to being the "most exciting Christian college on the east side of Seattle" on its Web site. 

But right now, the 70-year-old private college of 1,200 students may well be the most talked-about school in the nation, as the U.S. Supreme Court wrestles with the case brought by former student Joshua Davey of Spokane. 

Davey sued Washington state when it rescinded a $2,800 merit scholarship after he declared theology as his major. Since then, the lower courts have reached conflicting decisions on the church-state case known as Locke v. Davey, and the Supreme Court reportedly also is divided on the issue. 

Davey himself called faculty members Tuesday to give a blow-by-blow account of the court process. 

Staff have also been preparing for the media as the school has its moment in the limelight.

David Conners, 20, a freshman studying pastoral ministries, said he receives about $2,200 from a state need-based scholarship, helping toward his $23,000 annual tuition-and-board cost. If Davey loses the case, Conners said, he'll lose the scholarship-but will find another way to finance his studies. 

Sarah Kelly, 18, another freshman who receives a need-based scholarship, said, "I think they should treat all students the same, religion or not." 

Davey enrolled at Northwest College, which is affiliated with the Assemblies of God, in 1999. The state granted him a two-year Promise Scholarship, but later rescinded it. Davey sued and has pursued the case despite abandoning his initial career choice in favor of Harvard Law School.

 Like 36 other states,  Washington bans government funding of religious instruction.

Winning the Miss Florida USA Pageant this July is a short-term goal for senior Claudia Santiano.
 	
After winning the Miss Hispanidad 2003 and the Miss Carnaval 2001 pageants, she is now working towards greater career goals. 

Santiano will graduate from FIU this Spring as a broadcast journalism major with a minor in Spanish. 
 
In order to cope with her classes and extracurricular activities she has had to learn effective time management.  She had to make time for competing in pageants, attending school and her internship at NBC 6 and its partner, Channel 51, Telemundo. 

 Santiano, a Miami native, said she was encouraged by her family to enter beauty pageants from a young age. At 18, without any previous experience, she began taking modeling classes.

 Soon after she  entered the Miss Carnaval 2000 pageant , where she finished in the top ten.

"No one really influenced me, I'm the type of person who is very independent, " said Santiano, who is 22-years-old. 

"I basically entered the pageant because I was curious. I'm a go-getter. If something interests me. I never second guess myself in anything," she said. 

In 2000, Santiano  participated in the Miss Hispanidad 2000 pageant and finished first runner up. 

The following year, with help from her modeling teacher, Santiano prepared and was able to compete in the Miss Carnaval 2001 pageant where she won the title. 

Miss Carnaval 2001 was televised on Telemundo; the airing opened many doors for Santiano. 

"Beauty pageants gave me so much self confidence and poise, it really developed my personality," Santiano said. "I like being in front of the camera, I've never been camera shy."

After doing commercials for Clairol, Ford and Sears, Santiano got the opportunity to host the Miss Carnaval 2002 show for Telemundo. She was also given the option to host a Calle Ocho English language segment for the Travel Channel. 

Even with all the great opportunities arising, Santiano continued to focus on pageant competition.

On Santiano's second attempt at the Miss Hispanidad 2003 crown she succeeded and won the pageant.

Since last year, Santiano has been preparing for the Miss Florida USA pageant in Hollywood, FL. and she is very optimistic.
 
For now, Santiano is combining school with part-time at a  modeling school and her internship. 

"Modeling is not my goal; I'm more career-oriented,"  Santiano said. 
After graduation she is considering law school or a master's degree.
"I don't want to just settle. I don't know what the future holds for me." 
By studying law, she hopes to be able to work in the field, or to be able to combine journalism with law in the future. 

"I'm a very easy going person. I do everything in my power to attain the goals I set for myself. But, if it doesn't happen, I won't get frustrated, " Santiano said.

Headline: Graduate school tests, high costs challenge applicants
Author: Gosia Darwin/Staff Writer

Viviana Moreno thought graduate school was a good idea. A senior sociology and anthropology major, Moreno wanted to explore her chosen fields in greater detail.

"I am fascinated by religion and how societies react to it, plus I need the academic base that can help me do my research," said Moreno, who plans to apply to graduate school in April.

 Like many prospective graduate students, Moreno, 44, had a long professional career but decided to go back to school. 

Students engage in graduate education for a variety of reasons, including career advancement, preparation for work in a new field, or personal growth. 

Statistics from  FIU's Office of Institutional Research show that nearly 8,000 people applied to the University Graduate School in 2002-2003 academic year. One in two students was admitted and about 60 percent of those, or 2,500 students, actually enrolled.

By comparison, University of Miami graduate enrollment in the same school year was about 3,300 and Florida Atlantic University registered just over 3000. 

"Economically speaking, you can easily get a better job and earn more money in your field if you have a graduate degree," said Mark Szuchman, the associate dean for faculty at the Graduate Studies and Technology department of College of Arts and Sciences. "And you clearly need it if you want to pursue an academic career."
But is graduate school for everyone? 

First of all, it will cost you. In the 2003-2003 academic year, the graduate tuition per credit hour cost $201.51 for Florida residents and $770.58 for those out of state. 

The annual costs for international graduate students who would take nine credit hours during both spring and fall terms would be around $30,000.

Still, there is demand, competition and selection. At FIU about 50 percent of those who applied in 2002-2003 were rejected. The graduate school wants to attract the academic best of the student body.

"A rich graduate experience needs more than excellent faculty," said Douglas Wartzok, vice provost for Academic Affairs and dean of University Graduate School.

"Because FIU has been able to attract a very talented group of students to its graduate programs, you have the assurance that you will be stimulated through interactions with your peers at all stages of the graduate program," added Wartzok. 

Prospective graduate students must meet the minimum standards of the university and take care of additional individual requirements set by the department of their choice. 

The basic requirements include an overall GPA above 3.0 and a sufficiently high GRE score. The GRE, the Graduate Record Examination, is an obligatory test required by the State University System of Florida. It allows graduate programs to compare applicants with different educational backgrounds.

The GRE tests vocabulary, reading comprehension, logical reasoning, arithmetic, and some algebra and geometry. It adapts to individual skill level. If the answer is wrong, the score goes down and the next question is easier. Accordingly, the testing program automatically raises the bar if the answers are correct. 

The test has to be taken at an authorized center (there are three in Miami) and is offered three times per year. The closest test is on March 13, and the registration deadline is on  Jan. 30. 
June 1 is the last day to apply for admission to FIU's Graduate School for the Fall semester. For those who already have the sufficient GRE score and are ready to start in the summer, the application deadline is March 1. 

The minimum GRE score set by FIU's University Graduate School in 2002-2003 school year was 1120 points scored on the verbal and quantitive parts combined. 

But the GRE is not the ultimate factor when it comes to admission. 
FIU colleges and departments look more closely at different parts of the test and can set their own standards. Many have additional requirements as well.

"Very important characteristics we also look at are student's GPA and a writing sample," said Szuchman.

Moreno, like other aspiring graduate students in the religious studies department, does not have to bother with any admission tests if her GPA is at least 3.5. 

"All I need to do is come to classes, study hard, bring two faculty recommendation letters and a writing sample, which makes things much easier," she said. 

The requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences are very diverse. The college is home to a large share of FIU's graduate students, offering 35 out of nearly 120 graduate programs available through eight colleges and schools university wide. 

For example, to apply to a graduate program in biology, which, according to Szuchman has the highest number of graduate students in the college, a candidate also needs two letters of recommendation and a faculty sponsor. 

The School of Architecture expects some experience, requiring graduate candidates to submit a portfolio of at least 10 examples of creative design work, to demonstrate student's creative abilities and graphic skills. 

The College of Business Administration lets the candidates choose between the GRE and GMAT, the Graduate Management Admission Test. The GMAT is a standardized version relevant to graduate studies in business and management. 

The School of Journalism and Mass Communication, expects a 500-750 word essay and a professional resume, besides the minimum 500 on the verbal GRE (for admission into programs taught in English.)

The LSAT, or the Law School Admission Test, is weighted heavily in the evaluative process for admission to FIU's College of Law. 

The closest LSAT is coming up on Feb. 7, but those who have not yet registered and want to take it in June can sign up by May 7.  

The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is designed for students who apply to medical schools. The registration period for the Aug. 2004 test is March 12 through 26. 

The graduate admission process, just like the rest of FIU, is becoming more and more computerized. 
	
According to this year's official graduate catalog, the option to submit applications via conventional mail will no longer be available after Jan. 2004.
