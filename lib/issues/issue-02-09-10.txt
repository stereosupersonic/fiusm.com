&nbsp;
Playing without the injured Sun Belt Player of the Year Nirvana Kos (back), the Golden Panther volleyball team dropped 2 of 3 matches at the FIU Invitational Tournament.

Host FIU (4-6) won its opening match of the two-day tournament before dropping the next two contests.
 
FIU 3, IUPUI 2
 
FIU used double-digit kill performances from four players to overcome a two-game deficit and come back to defeat IUPUI 27-30, 30-32, 30-18, 30-26, 15-11 on Saturday.

"After [Tuesday's five game loss to FAU], they were heartbroken," head coach Cookie Stevens said of her players. "They were mad."

After dropping the opening two games by a combined four points, the Golden Panthers outlasted IUPUI in a match where the two teams totaled 48 attack errors and 33 service errors.

FIU dominated the third game before finding itself trailing 13-15 in the fourth.

That's when a Jennifer Owens kill ignited a six point run that gave FIU a 19-15 lead. IUPUI would fight back, to tie the game at 20 before Charlyn Ball-Llovera's kill put the Golden Panthers ahead for good.

The game featured the emergence of 16-year old Russian freshman Oksana Zablueva, who joined the team after the start of the season. 
Zablueva recorded three service points in the game and, early in frame, hit the winning shot on three straight points.

"Oksana just sparked us," Stevens said. "She kept getting more and more comfortable as the match went on."

Zablueva, who finished with 13 kills, would continue to help FIU in the deciding fifth game.

With FIU leading 4-3, the Golden Panthers won six straight points on the freshman's serve, which included four service winners.

Owens closed out the match with her 15th kill and FIU escaped with a victory.

"I'm very proud of the way they came back," Stevens said. "We tried a lot of different people in a lot of different places."

Adriana Fundora led all players with 18 blocks and six of FIU's 15 service aces. She also had 21 digs.

Ball-Llovera added 15 kills while committing only one error.
I'd like to give a lot of credit to Charlie," Stevens said. She didn't have an error in the first four games. She is one of those players who is overlooked. She was the glue today."

FIU relaxed after dropping the first game.

"We just go for it," Ball Llovera said. "You don't think about it. You just go for it."

Setters Betsy Moreland and Elizabeth Baldwin had 31 and 27 assists, respectively.
            
FSU 3, FIU 2
 
Just hours after its comeback win over IUPUI, FIU once again found itself down two games, this time falling behind Florida St. in Saturday's second match.

Just as the Golden Panthers did earlier in the day, the team fought back to even the match at 2-2, before falling 30-18, 30-26, 32-24, 28-30, 15-13.

"I can't be upset with my team," Stevens said. "[FSU] came out on fire. We had to make adjustments. I changed my line-up a few different times."

Trailing by six, 18-24, in the third game, FIU won 10 of the next 13 points to pull ahead 28-27. FSU tied the game and then set-up a match point at 29-28, but Zablueva tapped a shot between four Seminoles to tie the game. 

FIU would save a second match point and FSU withstood two Golden Panther game points, before an Owens block and Fundora kill gave FIU the game.

The Seminoles also led in game 4, opening a 21-17 advantage.

The Golden Panthers then utilized another run, outscoring FSU 14-8 over the remainder of the game, to tie the match at two games.
For the second time of the day, FIU's play improved after falling behind.
"It's an emotional thing," Stevens said. "We're still finding ourselves. It was a matter of a few mistakes here and there."

"It's a process you have to go through. I hate going through it, but you have to."

In the final game, FSU took the lead early and never looked back, thanks to a .400 attack percentage. FIU pulled within 13-14, before the 
Seminoles' Kristin Frye's kill ended the match.

Fundora recorded her second double-double of the day, with 19 kills and 12 digs. 

Owens added 15 kills and nine blocks.

"Jennifer did great. She had nine blocks by herself. That's crazy," Stevens said.

Zeblueva added 15 kills and Moreland had 38 assists.
 
UM 3, FIU 2
 
FIU endured its shortest match of the tournament at the hands of cross-town rival Miami. The Hurricanes, who won the team's 21st straight regular season match and improved to 10-0 this season, defeated the Golden Panthers 30-22, 30-20, 30-27. 

The Golden Panthers never looked comfortable in the match.

"We just didn't get anything going," Stevens said. "Our ball control broke down. We have to pass better. It's been happening all weekend, but we overcame it yesterday. The girls see it very clearly now."

FIU never led after the first 10 points in any of the three games.

"Miami outplayed us tonight," Stevens said. 

"They are a good team. We didn't have the same fire we had yesterday."
Fundora led FIU with 14 kills and 10 digs for her third double-double of the tournament.

FIU drops to 4-6 on the year.
 
Kos injury
 
Kos's back injury, which kept her out of the entire tournament, is not expected to cause her to miss next weekend's Georgia Tech Invitational.
Kos is epected to return to practice this week in preparation for the tournament.

FIU 3,  Tenn. Tech 1

FIU defeated Tennessee Tech (30-20, 30-22, 19-30, 33-31) in the morning and Texas-Pan American (30-28, 30-26, 30-15) in the nightcap.

Headline: Football suffers first defeat to Elon, 23-22
Author: Daniel Izquierdo Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After seeming nearly invincible last week at FIU Community Stadium the Golden Panthers received a wake-up call  as the team suffered its first loss of the season Saturday night at Elon, NC before a crowd of 5,580 spectators. 

Head Coach Don Strock took full responsibility for the loss, citing the team's lack of focus.

"They were emotionally ready last week," said Strock. "This week, I knew from the gun that they weren't ready to play."  The head coach added: "I blame myself. The head coach is the guy that gets them ready. They might have still been floating on cloud nine from St. Peter's.  But it was my job to pull them down. But there will be some changes at practice coming up this week."

Perhaps Saturday night was more of a humbling experience than anything else.  The Golden Panthers showed inexperience just a week removed from a near flawless performance. Missed tackles,  missed extra points and flags for excessive celebration ran rampant.  

Despite all the mistakes, FIU still put itself in a position to win in the third quarter with 6:00 to go.  Freshman quarterback Jamie Burke connected with wide receiver Harold Leath on a 68-yard touchdown pass. Leath decided to strut his way into the end zone from 10 yards out in such a way that drew flags from two officials for excessive celebration.  The point after attempt was pushed back fifteen yards because of the penalty and would be missed for the second time of the night leaving FIU with a 22-20 lead.  

The Phoenix made their share of mistakes en route to a 377 yard rushing performance, turning the ball over five times, including four fumbles.  However, the mishaps couldn't put a halt on Elon's methodical game-winning drive of 72 yards that lasted more than nine minutes.  The drive was capped off when kicker Anthony Turowski nailed a 23-yard field goal with just under three minutes remaining. The score proved to be the game winner.

Burke had his first crack at greatness as he tried to engineer the Golden Panthers' comeback drive but came up short of accomplishing that feat when he was intercepted by Elon safety Chris Geter with 1:32 left.  

Linebacker Nick Turnbull, who recorded 15 tackles, summed up the teams' performance. "We played stupid.  We had dumb penalties – roughing the passer, off sides, hot-dogging. Teams that win don't make those mistakes.  We've got to go back to practice and work hard.  I think we learned some lessons tonight."

"I was just so excited I beat the cornerback and made a big play," said Leath, who had four catches for 141 yards and two touchdowns.  "I didn't really think I reacted. And now I have to apologize to the team about that.  Football is like life.  We have to learn from our mistakes – and I learned a big lesson."

This week's game started much like last week's, with FIU taking an early lead on running back Rashod Smith's run from eight yards out.  Kicker Doug Jones, who was one for two last week and one for three Saturday on extra point attempts, made the kick to give the Golden Panthers a 7-0 advantage.  

However, the Phoenix would respond with a 10 play, 74-yard drive that was capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run on fourth and goal.  

Shortly after, FIU's kicking woes would take center stage once again as kicker Adam Moss failed to connect on of one his field goal attempts in the second quarter.  After Leath's first touchdown score, a 23-yard strike from backup quarterback David Tabor, Jones would miss the ensuing extra point.  

FIU went into halftime with a 16-13 lead after a Phoenix extra point was blocked following a touchdown.  

Elon would take the lead, 20-16, about halfway through the third quarter after a long punt return gave the Phoenix good field position.  

Even though the Golden Panthers' performance  did not result in a victory Saturday night, it was still good enough to receive praise from the head coach of Elon, Al Seagraves. "Their future is now.  They're an outstanding football team. They're as good as a good a team as we've played since I've been here."

FIU will play host to Butler next Saturday at 3:30 at FIU Community Stadium. 

News and Notes

 Jermell Weaver, a transfer from the University of Miami, and runinng back Tori Robinson were in uniform for Saturday's game but did not play.

Weaver is recovering from surgery performed last November on his anterior cruciate ligament. Head coach Don Strock said he was contemplating medically redshirting Weaver for this season. Strock's decision could come this week.

Robinson twisted his ankle against St. Peters. He is expected to return to practice this week and may play in Saturday's game versus Butler. If not, Rashod Smith is expected to be the starter. Smith started in Robinson's place against Elon on Saturday night, finishing with 81 yards rushing on 17 carries. 

Also, the St. Peters Peacocks, last weeks opponent, lost to Fordham 43-0 on Saturday.

Headline: Primary Election Showdown: Repeal of rights ordinance threatens spirit of democracy
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Imagine losing your job or your apartment through no fault of your own, merely because your boss or landlord disagrees with the people you date.  Seems pretty backward doesn't it?  

With all the pride we hold toward the founding documents and principles of this nation, like the Bill of Rights and the idea of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, one might wonder how a scenario like this could ever occur – especially in a diverse and supposedly tolerant city like Miami, right?  Wrong.  Sadly, the concept of freedom this nation was founded on has never truly applied to all citizens in practice.  

Throughout the years, as a nation we've collectively struggled with civil rights in terms of black citizens, women, and although we've come a long way, the recent campaign to repeal Miami's Human Rights Ordinance, re-enacted in 1998, shows our struggles are not over.  

The ordinance, first amended in 1977, protects individuals from discrimination in Miami in terms of employment, finances and housing on the basis of sexuality. 

Opponents of the ordinance, which include several Christian coalitions, claim that rather than protect individuals from discrimination, the measure actually grants homosexuals special treatment.  

My response to that argument is simple:  Since when does the right to own a home and keep a job you deserve constitute special treatment?  The fact of the matter is, it doesn't, and ensuring that individuals have these fundamental freedoms seems like it should be an important concern for a nation founded on the principles of liberty and democracy.  

There are a few individuals, however, who seem to believe in the idea of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" when it's convenient, or when it pertains to individuals whose particular pursuits they agree with. I can't help but feel that concept is anything short of hypocrisy.  

As a practicing Catholic, the notion of allowing your fellow humans to go without a home or employment seems flagrantly un-Christian to me as well, or maybe there are some unknown exceptions to Jesus' question about showing concern for others: "When I was naked, did you clothe me?"  Perhaps, once again, this is just another idea people follow when it's convenient for them.   

Religious convictions aside, as a member of a democracy, the idea of allowing discrimination in terms of some of the most basic rights should spark outrage, and if we care about preserving a system founded on liberty, we must defend it at all times.  

When the framers of our republic wrote the principles of our nation, they never said it would be easy. Is it sad that we have to have an ordinance enforcing equality? Yes.  It would be great to say we live in a society where discrimination is not an issue.  

However, as long as we still have members of society who seem as though they would prefer if the final words of our Pledge of Allegiance were: "liberty and justice for some," then we must continue to defend and implement measures that ensure equality across the board.  

Will we ever achieve a perfect egalitarian system where an ordinance like this one is not necessary? 

It's doubtful, but if we exercise one of our freedoms and vote against the repeal of our Human Rights Ordinance, the message would be clear: we're not ready to give up on this notion of "liberty" just yet.

Headline: Student reflects on memory of Sept. 11
Author: Jennyfer Parra/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
If someone would have asked me what I did Sept. 6, I probably couldn't answer that question, but like many others I can account for every minute of Sept. 11.

My day started very simple. My parents were out of town, I took my sister to school, turned on the radio, got my morning coffee and headed to class. Most of us went about our day oblivious to the turmoil that was occurring that morning. 

When I received a text message from my friend with a simple statement that read: "The World Trade Center has been hit." I, incredulously, wrote back to stop joking and go back to work, when at 9:10 in the morning, six minutes after the second tower had been hit, I received another text this one saying "The second one has been hit." 

To my knowledge, I was the only one in the room who knew. I remember telling my friend about it, but I couldn't concentrate so I went to the bathroom and encountered the first realization that this had actually happened. 

I met this total stranger who was hysterically crying, hardly able to dial a phone. I asked her what was wrong and with tears I can never forget, told me, her boyfriend was interning at the first tower. 

I hugged her and cried for the things that were and would never be again.  Sadly, at that moment I couldn't bring myself to tell her it was all going to be OK. Instead, like the oldest of friends, we went to find the nearest television and sat holding hands amidst a sea of faces. 

Time stopped and breaths were held – the tower had collapsed. We watched and gasped as if every beam, every desk, every human, had been blown apart in front of our eyes. 

Terror had been personified, it had crawled into the inner sanctum of what we thought was a terror free zone. With an odd sense of anxious sensitivity, age, race, and gender, meant nothing. In the silence that followed lay a fear no one dared voice out loud, and for that one moment, silence had said too much. 

We sat and cried and felt desperation, and the immense need to find a familiar haven of security. 

I left this girl whom I had never met and will probably never meet again, yet had connected with in a level I have yet to fully understand, by herself calling a city frozen in time. 

I got into my car with the same desolate indescribable feeling of angst millions of Americans were feeling, turned on the radio, and as my usual 30-minute ride turned into an hour and a half, sat and listened to pandemonium. 

What I remember most about that day is the courage and misery in the eyes of those Americans looking for loved ones, as well as those helping others in need.  Though I can't fake the nationalism I never felt, the quality of life Americans espouse are made me proud. 

In hindsight, the only lesson to be learned from this is a personal one – take from this day what you want, may it be courage, strength to change the world, or become a more concerned citizen. 

Right now, however, I like everyone else, feel as though I am still asking why, and the answer seems nowhere near closer than it had been a year ago. 

As you read where I was Sept. 11 think back to where you were and take a minute to reflect on those who died and even more for those who lived. 

This is where I was Sept. 11. Where were you?

Headline: In Our View: Excessive displays of patriotism should not distract from vital issues
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
As a result of the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S., our nation has responded with an overwhelming display of patriotism.

Initially, a strong sense of nationalism seemed a relatively appropriate response to the grief and sorrow many Americans were experiencing. 

Thus, displays of patriotism became a symbol of our ability to show some kind of optimism in light of this horrific tragedy.  

In the months that followed Sept. 11, signs of patriotism were common in most places and ranged from mass rallies and to a simple flag adorning a car window.  

These rampant displays of patriotism seemed at first something to be somewhat proud of, a positive response by millions of Americans, a symbol of banding together as one.  

However, as time passed, this raging patriotism became excessive, bordering on  gratuitous. 

And we've all probably noticed it.  

How many of us can honestly say they didn't hear "I'm Proud to be an American" or "God Bless America" far too many times for comfort?  Or groaned at the sight of tribute after meaningless tribute, some featuring children's drawings, others, country singers whining about our greatness, and on a few horrendous cases, both?   

After a while, these displays of patriotism became not only excessive, but pretty much embarrassing.  

Patriotism is something that is, indeed, so self-gratifying that it can only be tolerated in small doses.  

Moreover, it overshadows the truly important issues raised by events like Sept. 11.  

In the immediate wake of Sept. 11, Americans began to question, some for the first time, our role in foreign affairs.

The little bubble of isolation we once lived in was destroyed.  

However, due to the rampant, excessive patriotic displays, soon many Americans replaced important social questions about the US government and its international relations with shouts of "America is the greatest nation ever! We rock!"

Thankfully, many Americans still question these issues, and in measured doses, patriotism can be a positive thing. 

But as we prepare for the anniversary of this tragedy, we cannot allow ourselves to be swept up by the overwhelming patriotic displays that will undoubtedly occur.  

We simply cannot allow our pride to keep us from truly admitting that the aftermath of Sept. 11 is far from over.

Winners

The Dolphins: Miami is off to a fast start again, thrashing the Detroit Lions 49-21. Hopefully this winning trend will continue since the Dolphins seem to finally have that running game we've been hearing so much about. Props to Ricky Williams and his 111-yard performance.  

Serena Williams: Give it up for good old fashioned sibling rivalry! You are truly an inspiration for any person who has ever lived in their older sibling's shadow has always secretly dreamed of beating the pants off of them in competition.   

Swimfan: What happens when the thirty year-old teenage guy from "Bring It On" gets stalked by the drug-addict daughter of Michael Douglas from "Traffic?" Apparently, audiences were dumb enough to plunk down money to find out.

Losers

FIU Football:  Guess we can't wear those "still undefeated" shirts any more after the 23-22 loss to Elon this week. What we might want to look into is new kickers since ours can't seem to make a field goal.  Where did we find these guys?  The Scott Norwood School of kicking?

U.S. Men's Basketball:  After years of dominating basketball worldwide, you guys had nowhere to go but down.  Look on the bright side, losing to Argentina and Yugoslavia might be a good thing.  At least now we'll have some real competition.  

Movie-viewing audiences: After fattening studio pockets this summer, Hollywood returns the favor with drivel like "Swimfan" and "Feardotcom." "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" seems so far away right now.

Headline: Letter to the Editor#2:  Professors must not be terminated for expressing own opinions, contractual obligations should be respected
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

Ghate, in an article titled "Middle-eastern conflict should not lead to campus censorship," concedes that freedom of speech "does protect an individual who voices unpopular ideas," but I wonder exactly what Ghate means by protection.  Affirming the ability of an institution of higher learning to arbitrarily and capriciously fire a faculty member, with no regard for issues such as contractual duties and tenure, simply because the management does not agree with his views, is scant protection at best – if it can even be called protection at all.  

 A university cannot simply fire its employees, especially tenured professors, on a whim; the employer must show that the employee has breached his contractual duty. Unless the language of the employment contract specifically states otherwise, expressing one's beliefs, no matter how unpopular, is never in and of itself grounds for termination; and in the case of an employment contract between a university and its professor, any agreement where this would not be the case is not worth signing. Ghate however, is half-right: 
The law does not remedy all kinds of injustices, only the injustices related to issues that it particularly regulates. The law does not generally regulate the personal and social interactions between individuals. There is no civil or criminal liability for refusing to associate with one on a personal level.  

Therefore, professors who express unpopular rhetoric may find themselves the victim of a variety of social punishments for which the law does not have remedy, for example, estrangement from family or getting the cold shoulder from other faculty. 

 However, the issue at hand, and the one that Ghate most pointedly addresses does not concern personal and social interactions between individuals of free will, but with the professional interactions between an employer – the university – and an employee – the professor.  

The law can and does regulate these interactions, for they are regulated via contracts: agreements forged between the employer and employee that impose duties upon them both, respectively.  One of these duties is that the employer cannot wrongfully terminate the employee's employment on a whim, especially in the case of a tenured professor; he must show cause for termination.  Namely, he must show the employee has breached the contract. 

Ghate is correct when he writes, "Freedom of speech is not the right of a Ph.D. to have others provide him with a university classroom" – an institution has great discretion in who it hires.  However, once Harvard provides that Ph. D. with a classroom, they may not fire him simply because he thinks Dick Cheney is a fascist, for example.  They must show cause.

 To allow the free exchange of ideas is necessary, indeed desirable, for a forum of ideas may be likened to a market in economics, with each idea competing for acceptance, the most meretricious idea succeeding. 

 Almost all economists agree that barriers to free trade are harmful to the economy, for they reduce competition among goods and services, usually crushing the ability of the best goods and services to survive. 

So too are barriers to academic freedom, for there exists the distinct possibility that among the unpopular ideas that may be quashed by these barriers, some would be ideas of exceptional quality and validity.  Unless we allow all ideas to compete based on their own merits, we may never find out which thoughts and ideas are representative of the truth.

Headline: Letter to the Editor#1:  Letter to the editor espouses ignorant, bigoted viewpoint
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I am writing in response to an opinion printed in the Sept. 3 edition of The Beacon: "UNC assignment not necessarily balanced educational endeavor" by Lonny Smith. 

I found the writer of the article, who was arguing against the University of North Carolina's summer project for incoming freshmen to read a book about the Islamic holy text the Qur'an, to be an ignoramus, and someone who also treaded the line of being a bigot.

She attempts to show how the Qur'an is a hate-filled book urging its followers to kill people of other religions. She quotes one verse completely out of context, adding the verse number in her article as if she is some sort of expert on Islam.

She says "the Koran itself instructs followers of Islam to kill those who won't convert and 'do not befriend the Jews and the Christians, for they are friends of each other.'" This is likely one of the most misquoted verses in the entire Qur'an. Further reading of the entire verse would show anything but hatred, but merely self-defense.

In actuality the verse is talking about non-Muslims who had deliberately broken treaties with the Muslims. Innocents are never harmed under rules of war in Islamic Law. Simply reading the verse, with or without commentary, would show the proof of the verse as self-defense against treacherous enemies, and not taking an offensive against innocents of another faith as Ms. Smith would have readers believe.

This sort of racist and ignorant commenting is similar to what led to the horrible calamity that befell the Jews in Nazi Germany. 

It is obvious then to see how UNC's summer program was actually quite beneficial because it eliminates ignorance and racism from students, allowing them to appreciate a religion that has long been misunderstood in the Western world.

Headline: Primary Election Showdown: Candidates bash Bush rather than focus on issues
Author: Jason Andeasen
&nbsp;
Since 1994 when a Republican Congress greeted President Clinton, partisanship has been one of the driving forces in American politics. Obviously, conflicts between the parties are a phenomenon older than all of the party congressmen who participate in them. 

However, it seems that over the past eight years or so, partisanship has become something that everyone is aware of, and is discussed as if it were the worst thing to happen to mankind since the bubonic plague.

The wall between the parties is built higher and higher with every election, even though many question just how different the parties really are. Party-line votes are not all that uncommon and are often commented on as a failure of the system. The interesting part of partisanship is the lip service about cooperation. As the wall grows exponentially, almost every political candidate tells us that they will be able to unite and work with both parties in areas and ways that their opponent could only dream of. 

However, immediately following that proclamation of bipartisanship they inform us all as to why their opponent, and the members of their party, don't have a single good idea and are all but purposely sending our country into an irreversible nosedive. Partisanship is rearing its head, in arguably one of the most blatant ways since the Republicans aimed their cannons at Bill Clinton, in Florida's gubernatorial race.

On Sept. 10, a Democratic candidate will be chosen to square off against Jeb Bush in November. Thus, recently, we have been bombarded with the three Democrats running for Jeb's job: Janet Reno, Bill McBride and Daryl Jones. All three have campaigned hard and talked a great deal about how they would correct the follies of our current governor. Many still question though how much they really have to offer.

Recently, all three Democratic candidates faced off in a televised debate. Each discussed their views on such controversial issues as the FCAT exam, health care reform and school vouchers. However, the central issue seemed to be Jeb Bush.

Much of the debate focused on Bush and his mistakes over the past few years. Over and over again the candidates declared how they would have either acted differently or how they will correct Jeb's mistakes. Many of their remedies sounded similar. 

In fact, the three candidates seemed to agree on almost everything. One of the moderators of the debate called them on this and asked them how the voters should distinguish between them. For the most part, they gave minor differences and eventually ended up talking about the real aim of the Democratic candidates: deposing Jeb. Allow me to preface the remainder of this article by saying that I am a Democrat. I am a liberal and think that Jeb Bush has done a less than wonderful job as governor of Florida. 

His policies on education and drug treatment have hurt our state in many ways. Jeb Bush should not be granted another term in office. No greater product could come of the November election than Jeb Bush looking for work elsewhere. 

The problem, however, is that the Democratic candidates seemed to have made the annihilation of Jeb Bush their public platform. All three candidates have said that they would support any Democrat for the gubernatorial office. Obviously, this is a good thing; one would hope that the members of the Democratic Party would stand behind their nominee. 

The candidates made it evident during their debate that this support would exist in part because they each had such strong conviction when it came to whether or not Jeb should be reelected. Again, I am no fan of Jeb Bush. I hope he loses the election in November and we can begin to nurse some of the bruises he has left on the state of Florida. 

However, it would seem that the Democrats are going about it the wrong way. Janet Reno, Bill McBride and Daryl Jones have made their dislike for Jeb Bush more than obvious. The fact is that they have all but made "Get Rid of Jeb" their party platform in Florida. 

The Democrats have been complaining about partisanship ever since the Clinton impeachment fiasco began. Now, in Florida, they seem to be the perpetrators of partisanship. This sends the wrong message. It makes the Democratic Party look hypocritical. 

The Democrats should expose the wrongs of the current administration, which are not hard to find. However, their platforms should be more focused on issues, namely education (arguably the biggest obstacle facing Florida today) and prescription drug costs for seniors, rather than Jeb Bush specifically.

Headline: Professor chronicles university history
Author: Christina Oliva / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Since opening its doors in 1972, FIU has evolved considerably.  Starting out as an experimental university, FIU has become one of the top 100 public national universities.  

One of the fastest growing in the country, FIU offers a variety of academic programs and extracurricular activities, and hosts students from around the country and from more than 130 nations.   

Students can now choose from 19 colleges and schools to attend, join an honor society, or get a team together for their favorite intramural sport.  

Not too long ago, a plan was put into effect on how to best chronicle the University's vast achievements leading up to its 30th anniversary, which will take place this year. 

Due out in September, "Beyond the Tower," a book detailing the founding of FIU and including its recent accomplishments, will provide students, alumni and faculty with an insight to where the university has been and where it's going.

Author Tom Riley is a professor and administrator at FIU. Riley has been with the university for 29 years.  

"When the university first opened, it was experimental," Riley said. "There was no grading policy, no language requirement.  Now we have gone from one tower and grown to three campuses."  

Riley's multifaceted tasks at the university have included everything from becoming the first director of housing at the Biscayne Bay Campus, to teaching Freshman Experience along with former President Gregory Wolfe, just to name a few.  

"The main focus of this book is to construct a social history which covers many aspects of the university."

"Beyond the Tower" is appropriately named after the air control tower where founding President Charles Perry's office was first located.  

The book is divided into four sections, one for each president who has taken office at FIU in the last 30 years.  

There is one section for Charles Perry, one for Harold Crosby, one for Gregory Wolfe, and one for Modesto Maidique.  

"My main inspiration for this book was Charles Perry, FIU's first president.  After publishing a documentary for the 25th anniversary, he suggested that I also publish one for the 30th anniversary," Riley said.

It took Riley, along with Executive Provost Judy Blucher and School of Journalism and Mass Communications Associate Dean Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, over a year to finish the documentary.

"I couldn't have completed this without Judy or Lillian," Riley said.  "Lillian edited the book and did as much work as I did, and Judy lent her time and financial resources for the project." 

The book is due out in the beginning of the fall semester to coincide with the anniversary, and is presently being printed. It is 600 pages long and contains information, history, and over 80 photographs of the various campuses and events. 

Several other events will be taking place this year, which will coincide with FIU's 30th anniversary and will make history as well.  

The two major events are the inaugural game of FIU's new football team, and the opening of the new Law School. 

When asked about where FIU needed to go, Riley stated that it didn't need to go anywhere, but that the university ultimately will.  

"The future of FIU will be that of a major research university. Along with the new football team and Law School, it will ultimately include a Medical School as well. FIU will become the UCLA of South Florida."

Scramm feels student government should have a voice in some of the decisions the faculty makes regarding class offerings in upcoming semesters and the amount funding appropriated for scholarships. 

Special Events Director Ruth-Allyson Webster updated the council on the Town Hall Meeting to be held Sept. 17 in the Wolfson University Center's Mary Anne Wolfe Theatre. SGC expects Provost Mark Rosenberg to attend the meeting. 

Vice President Alexander Lewy will be attending the next Parking and Traffic meeting to be held on Sept. 13 at University Park. At the meeting, Lewy plans to address the concerns he received from students about the overflow of an average of 100 cars in the parking lots at least 3 days a week. Lewy also plans to address a reduced fare plan for FIU students who ride the Metro Bus. 

"Students who ride the metro bus are able to purchase monthly passes at a reduced price of $45 instead of $60," Lewy said. "But at the same time I also want to introduce a system where you show your FIU ID and ride the bus at a reduced fare." 

In the president's report, Carter congratulated the football team on its victory and announced that he will be attending the second game scheduled for Sept. 7 in North Carolina along with UP President Jessica Morffi. 

After a lengthy discussion, the council appointed senior Nicolette White to the position of Representative at Large. Aaron Gorin, a freshman, ran against White and was later offered an internship with SGC.

Headline: Foreign response to 9/11 has changed over the year
Author: Sebastian Rotella / Los Angeles Times Wire Services
&nbsp;
PARIS – On Sept. 12 last year, Le Monde newspaper printed a headline for the ages: ``We are all Americans.'' 

Such sentiment in France, whose Le Monde-reading elite tends to snipe at American politicians even as it consumes American products, epitomized a global outpouring of sympathy for the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks. 

In the following months, former foes and staunch allies backed what the United States called the war on terrorism. They generally regarded it as a smart, methodical campaign that did the world a service by toppling Afghanistan's Taliban regime and obliterating al-Qaida's base there. U.S. pressure combined with the horror of Sept. 11 to spur many countries to confront festering problems of Islamic extremism, border security and transnational crime. 

The aftermath brought international transformations such as a remarkable U.S.-Russian partnership. The "realpolitik'' of counterterrorism created instant winners (Israel), forlorn losers (Latin America) and unlikely allies (Pakistan). 

But in many ways and many places, the attacks did not change the world. The post Sept.-11 period of solidarity appears to have dissipated, a mere pause in a steady rise of disillusionment with the world's only remaining superpower, according to interviews conducted by Los Angeles Times correspondents around the world. 

With a few important exceptions, foreign leaders and voters say the United States mighty have missed a historic opportunity to forge a broad international coalition and improve its increasingly negative image. 

"There was an all-time high splash of pro-American sentiment after Sept. 11,'' said Yuri Levada, director of VTSIOM, one of Russia's main polling groups. ``But we soon saw that America didn't know what to do with all the support it was getting from all over the world, including (from) Russia.'' 

Today, critics accuse the United Sgates of aggressive unilateralism. Rightly or wrongly, they regard the Bush administration--with the notable exception of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell--as a caricature of arrogance. 

They cite President Bush's "axis of evil'' speech, the legal limbo of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, U.S. opposition to an international criminal court and environmental treaty and, most prominently, the current war of words on Iraq. 

If the United States marches alone against Iraq, it might find itself with fewer friends than in a long time, according to the interviews. 

"The U.S thinks it can fight any country that disobeys its rule,'' said Wu Wei, 35, a Chinese journalist. "But the truth is that no country can rule the world. ... If the United States doesn't modify its current policies, more Americans will be sacrificed for the wrongheaded policies of the U.S. government.'' 

America-bashing must be examined carefully and in context. It seems almost ritualistic for some countries to blow off steam with rhetoric while quietly cooperating with and benefiting from U.S. policies. 

Anti-Americanism is a familiar and tricky phenomenon, according to Chris Brown, a professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics. Brown said Europeans react superficially to issues such as the saber-rattling on Iraq, failing to recognize that the debate in Washington, D.C., is more sophisticated than critics would admit. 

"There is an ambiguous view of America in the world anyway,'' Brown said. 

"Everybody criticizes it, but the people who criticize it most virulently are the same ones who want to go and work there.'' 

The United States still enjoys the allegiance of allies from Britain to Japan, from Australia to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi declared with characteristic effusiveness last year: ``I love America. I am on whatever side America is on, even before I know what it is.'' 

The attitude on the "Arab street'' remains resolutely cold. It is usually dangerous to generalize about the Arab world because of its diversity, but when it comes to America, there seems near universal agreement. 

Distrust of America is pervasive, particularly in a place such as Jordan where more than half the population is ethnically Palestinian. Many Arabs simply don't believe that Osama bin Laden was behind Sept. 11. 

Instead, they believe that Israel carried out the attacks to undermine the Palestinian uprising, and they view America's war on terrorism as part of a broad Zionist conspiracy. 

In Egypt and Jordan, two of the United States' closest allies in the region, there is a general sense that Washington, D.C., squandered any sympathy dividend. While many Arabs were upset by the number of civilian casualties in the Sept. 11 attacks, there is also a widespread belief that the United States had it coming and that a chastened America would evaluate its Middle East policy. 

"The U.S. has exploited 9/11 for its own agendas,'' said Maha Mohammed, 26, a student counselor at an American school in Cairo, Egypt. "Fighting terrorism has become this license to do anything.'' 

It might be more disconcerting to hear anti-American vitriol from nominal friends such as the South Koreans. Although the South Korean government unequivocally has committed itself to aiding the United States against terrorism, it is common to hear the "man on the street'' praise Osama bin Laden and say the United States has itself to blame. 

"I'm so happy,'' a high school student from Gwanju, South Korea, wrote to Bush about the terrorist attacks for an English-class assignment. "Because of that accident that broke out, Americans say, `Ha. Ha. Ha. We are heroes. We love peace.' In fact, it's (a) lie. They love war and power and money.'' 

South Korean anti-Americanism intensified after Bush included North Korea in his axis-of-evil speech, offending South Koreans who believe that present-day North Korea is more to be pitied than condemned. 

European governments worry that the United States will isolate itself by ignoring them. Perhaps nowhere is America's lost moral capital more obvious than in Germany, a nation lifted by U.S. generosity from the vanquished devastation after World War II to become a global economic power and a democratic paragon. 

U.S. citizens, from the lowliest G.I. to the visionary statesmen of the Cold War era, have been revered in Germany. 

But even some of Washington D.C.'s oldest admirers are shaking their heads over the aggressive drumbeat against Iraq and Washington's refusals to abide by international judicial, trade and environmental agreement.

Headline: Welcome celebrations extended through Fall Fest
Author: Carmen Paez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the excitement of the inaugural football game fading away, different organizations at the Biscayne Bay Campus continued welcome celebrations with Fall Fest.

The Student Programming Council, Student Organizations Council, Student Government Council, Panther Power and  the ladies of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority hosted Fall Fest from Sept. 3 – Sept. 5. 

"The purpose of the events is for entertainment as well as to keep the enthusiasm from Welcome Week and create a campus life," SPC Campus Life Assistant and Fall Fest Coordinator Zoila Rivera said.

Tuesday was Carnival Day by the flag poles outside Panther Square. Several booths served lemonade, cotton candy, snow cones and hot dogs, while other stands gave away balloons and painted students' faces. The Jazz Band and a DJ provided music. Rivera said approximately 200 students showed up.

The atmosphere switched to a more serious topic of discussion on Wednesday: employment. The Part-Time Job and Volunteer Fair, held in Panther Square, was a success, Career Services Coordinator Claudia Reich said. At least 400 students attended and interacted with the numerous employers that came out to BBC.  It was a joint event held by Career Services and the volunteer action center that brought employers including Abercrombie and Fitch, the Miami Heat Group and Bank United among others. 

"The most useful group was the guys from the Miami Heat, since they were having interviews on the spot. I know a couple of people that were hired today, too," sophomore Zakina Ogbourne said. "The fair was generally good; the food was great." 

In order to get a plate of free food, students had to pass through at least eight employers, and get stamped for their visit. Finance major and junior Natasha Nicholson from Career Services (what does she do there)? was surprised to see how many students actually went to the eight booths and then made the food line.

"I honestly expected them to just give up on trying to get free food," Nicholson said, "but there was excitement, a great vibe and rush of energy, and a really good turnout." 

On Wednesday, "Lord of the Rings" was shown at a makeshift Drive-in Movie by the Academic Two parking lots.

Students got free popcorn, glowsticks and chocolate. But that was not enough to attract many students.

Rivera said only about 80 students came out of the 200 plus expected. The costs exceeded the turnout.

One of the factors keeping them away was the 50 percent chance of rain expected for the evening, which caused SPC to move the screen a few times, so students did not know exactly where the movie was showing, Rivera explained.

On Thursday, students played Laser Tag at Panther Square. An inflated dome with a huge alien on top was the battlefield. 

"It was amazing," freshman Ludovica Virgile said. "My partner hit me over the head and I got shot 20 times, but it was pretty cool." 

Freshman Brandon Campbell went in three times.

"It's really dark and foggy from the smoke. You can't see anything at all in there," he said. "Basically you go in there and run around shooting people. It's awesome."

Later that night comedians Talent and Romeo from "Def Comedy Jam", entertained students.

The Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sponsored a party at the Wolfe University Center Ballrooms later that night.

Headline: Terror war progress hard to measure
Author: Richard Whittle and Michelle Mittelstadt / Knight-Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
WASHINGTON – Nearly a year after the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, the largest criminal probe in FBI history and a military campaign in Afghanistan costing billions, gauging progress in the war against terrorism remains difficult.

The U.S.-led military campaign routed the al-Qaida terrorist network and its Taliban backers in Afghanistan, making way for a government eager to help the United States consolidate its gains against the terrorists.

But U.S. officials remain uncertain if al-Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden is alive or dead. And while al-Qaida clearly has been damaged, government officials and private analysts warn the organization could reconstitute itself – and retains the ability to launch more attacks.

One way to think about the enemy in the war on terrorism "is like an iceberg," says Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

"There's a certain amount of it above the surface of the water, and then there's a great deal going on that's below the surface," he muses. "There's an awful lot we don't see."

That makes measuring progress in this war more difficult than in a conventional conflict, where battle lines visibly ebb and flow.

Rumsfeld and many other analysts are sure the United States is winning a counterterrorism campaign that involves an unusual marriage of military, intelligence and law enforcement forces. But they warn the battle with al-Qaida and affiliated Islamist terrorist groups is far from over.

"Our enemies, without question, are sharpening their swords," Rumsfeld said recently. "They are plotting even greater destruction, let there be no doubt."

The military rout of the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan offers the most visible evidence the United States is prevailing, Rumsfeld and others say.

"I think we're winning," said Richard Perle, chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board. "We're certainly not losing."

Operating in tandem with the military campaign, law enforcement agencies around the world have smashed al-Qaida cells, arrested hundreds of operatives, thwarted attacks and tried to shut down the terrorists' flow of funds. To date, the United States and its allies have frozen more than $112 million identified as terrorist assets.

Reflecting the melding between military and law enforcement efforts, documents and computers seized by troops in Afghanistan provided leads for "some very aggressive police work around the world," noted retired Adm. Bobby Inman of Austin, former director of the National Security Agency and ex-deputy director of the CIA.

"Clearly there have been successes in wrapping up al-Qaida cells, heading off probable attacks in Singapore, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom," Inman said.

The disrupted plots include an effort to destroy the U.S. Embassy in Paris and a terrorist operation in Singapore that targeted the embassies of the United States, Israel, Britain and Australia last December.

In June, Moroccan officials said they had broken up an al-Qaida cell that was targeting NATO warships in the Strait of Gibraltar. Other plots still unknown to the public also have been thwarted, senior U.S. counterterrorism officials say.

For all that, another way to think about terrorism is like a cancer, and while the initial "surgery" – the Afghan campaign – may have removed the most threatening "tumor," no one can clearly diagnose just how far the cancer has spread or where it might manifest itself again.

Al-Qaida operatives are believed to have "burrowed into some 60 countries," said Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, so the job is more complicated than making war against another sovereign state.

"You don't take it down the way you might kill a poisonous snake, by chopping off the head," Wolfowitz said. "It's more like an infection in the body. You have to go after the pockets of infection all over the place."

Iraq is one place al-Qaida members have escaped to, Rumsfeld said. As part of the administration's campaign to remove Saddam Hussein, he and other officials also have said there is a danger that Iraq could give weapons of mass destruction to terrorists.

For that reason, said Defense Policy Board chairman Perle, "You can't even imagine claiming victory in the war on terrorism if Saddam is left in place."

Others contend an attack on Iraq could create more problems than it would solve.

"Saddam is not a main contributor to al-Qaida's activities at present," said Brookings Institution analyst Michael O'Hanlon. "And he might have incentives to provide these terrorists with weapons of mass destruction if he knows his neck is on the line."

O'Hanlon said that while the war on terrorism may have reduced al-Qaida's ability to commit acts of terrorism by roughly 50 percent, "The question is how well it can reconstitute. Can they do another 9-11 or not?"

Given that only 19 terrorists directly took part in the attacks on New York and Washington, "You can imagine a small group with fewer resources getting lucky," he said.

The Sept. 11 investigation – the largest criminal probe in the FBI's history – has failed to uncover a large network of accomplices to the hijackers. 

U.S. authorities arrested more than 1,200 Middle Eastern and South Asian men, holding most on immigration infractions, but have charged only one person to date in connection with the attacks: Zacarias Moussaoui.

Federal law enforcement officials say the lack of U.S. conspirators says more about the highly compartmentalized al-Qaida plot than it does about an inability by authorities to detect them. The Sept. 11 plot was hatched in Afghanistan and organized largely in Germany, Attorney General John Ashcroft and others have said.

Counterterrorism experts also say al-Qaida doesn't need bin Laden to continue its mission. 

The reality that al-Qaida would survive, possibly even thrive, even without its infamous founder is one reason FBI, CIA and other officials say their focus is on the handful of high-level operatives who could assume the bin Laden mantle.

"We're after all of them," said Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Al-Qaida's failure to pull off another major attack since Sept. 11 is no guarantee there won't be another, said Inman, the former intelligence official.

Periods of one to three years separated the group's past dramatic attacks: the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993; the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa; the 2000 bombing of the destroyer USS Cole.

Others warn the success of the military campaign may be fleeting. About 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, working with allies to search out and destroy al-Qaida and Taliban remnants. Some analysts say their presence and tactics could lead Afghans to rise up against the United States.

Military analyst William Lind of the iconoclastic Free Congress Foundation sees evidence for that in recent attacks on U.S. troops, which he predicts will increase "until eventually we are driven out of Afghanistan."

The rout of the Taliban was a battlefield victory only, Lind contends, like initial American success in the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union's success in occupying Afghanistan in 1979 and 19th century Britain's early success in trying to conquer Afghanistan.

The message al-Qaida probably took from the Afghan campaign is that "they can survive the worst the United States is willing to throw at them," Lind said. "They were hurt by it, but they certainly weren't destroyed by it."

Headline: Questions still loom over WTC site redevelopment
Author: Carolyn Barta / Knight-Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
NEW YORK – Think subway, Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, Empire State Building. This is a city that has solved enormous urban problems with aplomb. But almost a year after the attack that erased the twin icons that defined its skyline, New York City is grappling with its most sensitive challenge ever – how to redevelop Lower Manhattan.

Sacred ground. High-rise splendor. A neighborhood that's alive 24/7. These are competing interests planners must balance from the many and diverse stakeholders – victims' families, business, government, residents, prideful New Yorkers and the nation. How are they doing it?

"Two steps forward, one step back," said Ernest Hutton of Hutton Associates, a New York urban planner and communications chairman for New York New Visions, a coalition of architecture and design groups that formed after 9-11. His group favors a strategic plan for the whole area.

While an awesome task, this one is no more difficult than others New York has faced in its 400-year history, said historian Mike Wallace, co-author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898." 

"This place has always been about complex negotiations between a multiplicity of players," he said.

The latest step backward came after New Yorkers recoiled at the heavy commercialization of the initial six site plans unveiled this summer by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Planners are back at the drawing boards. Officials are floating new ideas, from land swaps to using eminent domain to protect the hallowed ground.

Responding to the lukewarm response for its designs, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. this week asked architecture firms from around the world to submit fresh proposals.

``We're looking for the best ideas, wherever they can be found,'' said Alex Garvin, the lead designer for the development corporation.

"It's very important that the site is more than just a real estate development. It obviously has a much larger symbolic value," Hutton said. "It needs to reflect the aspirations of everyone in the city as well as in the country and internationally. It needs to be a symbol of our determination to rebuild, but it also needs to work." 

Some New Yorkers said the first plans, which would cluster office buildings around a potential memorial, don't work – they're dull and a transparent effort to marry commercial greed with a shrine. 

At a mammoth town hall meeting last month, many New Yorkers said restoring all 11 million square feet of World Trade Center office space and 600,000 square feet each of retail and hotel space – as required by the leaseholder and property owner – would not provide an appropriate setting for a memorial.

Most of the 4,500 participants at "Listening to the City," an event sponsored by 85 community groups under the umbrella of the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, said they wanted more majestic plans, innovative designs and an inspirational memorial that preserves the footprints of the towers.

Many victims' families have demanded that the city not build on the area where the towers stood. The Families Advisory Council also recently called for a ground zero tomb for unidentified and unclaimed human remains.

The first priority should be to create a memorial to those "who went to work one day and never came home," said Monica Iken, whose husband was killed in the attack.

Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani favors making the 16-acre site a commerce-free zone and memorial park, but current Mayor Michael Bloomberg has argued, "less is more."

To Laura Sikola, whose cousin died when the towers fell, ground zero is "16 acres of cemetery. There is no nice way to put that. … Can you imagine the outcry if we dug up Auschwitz and put a strip mall there?" The site should be a park where people can go and reflect, she said. "No Tiffanys, no Starbucks, no office space. It should not be a cemetery full of tombstones, but whether you call it a cemetery or a park, that is where (almost) 3,000 people died."

There are other stakeholders, including those who live and work in Lower Manhattan. Many fear tourists will overtake their neighborhood and a memorial will be too tacky or too somber. 

"Don't forget about us. There are residents who live there," said Michael Kaufman, 31, an architect who lives in Battery Park City and works in Midtown Manhattan. Several makeshift memorials already have turned the neighborhood into "a very morbid area," he said. "You walk the streets and there are people weeping. We come home to that every day." 

Since the plans were revealed, people have "come out for a gentler approach," Wallace said, that would re-create the street grid interrupted by the World Trade Center complex and provide housing, offices, shops, cultural institutions and green space – "a mixed set of uses that together will restore vigorous liveliness to a place so marked by death."

The decision-makers are the leaseholder, the property owner and New York's governor.

Only months before the attack, developer Larry Silverstein had taken a 99-year lease on the World Trade Center property, which is owned by the Port Authority. Westfield America holds the lease on the retail space. The lessees have the right to rebuild; the Port Authority wants to recoup its income of $120 million a year in lease payments. 

Gov. George Pataki, meanwhile, has the political muscle. He holds half the power in the Port Authority, along with Gov. James McGreevey of New Jersey. 

The Lower Manhattan Development Corp., appointed jointly by the governor and the mayor, is supposed to oversee the redevelopment.

Pataki has said that the Port Authority should look beyond the 16-acre former World Trade Center site to rebuild downtown office space. He also said the state could seize the land by condemnation and compensate the Port Authority. Innovative ideas from the city include swapping LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports to the Port Authority for the property.

Experts say Lower Manhattan already is awash in office space. Before Sept. 11, it was America's third-largest business district, behind Midtown Manhattan and Chicago. But it hasn't, for a long time, been the financial capital of the world. Financial interests have moved to Midtown and to New Jersey.

"If you could build 11 million square feet on the site, you wouldn't. The market has changed," Hutton said. "We need to look at phasing."

Headline: Eminem moves crowds in Anger Management Tour
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
The Anger Management Tour, headlined by Eminem, rolled into the National Car Rental Center last Sunday in front of a jam-packed, frenzied crowd of over 19,000 fans. In years past, Anger Management has featured headliners such as Limp Bizkit and Korn. The show has evolved from its inception and now includes Ludacris, Papa Roach, Xzibit and the X-Ecutioners. Despite the shift, the hard-nosed edginess that had been the norm of the tour remains, and hip-hoppers, rockers, freaks and geeks alike all flocked to capture the moment.

The show opened with the X-Ecutioners on the turntables, scratching and mixing rock and hip-hop beats. Xzibit came on next, performing material from his new album, Man vs. Machine, which was a definite crowd pleaser, as well old songs like "X" and "Bitch Please." 

Other highlights included the man from the ATL., Ludacris, who perfomed hit after hit displaying his usual Southern hospitality, getting an enthusiastic crowd to throw some "bows." Papa Roach, representing the only rock portion of the show, stunned the audience with their effective guitar playing, raucous lyrics and mosh-pitting routine. They packed a punch and brought energy to a great crowd that sought any excuse to jump up out of their seat and go wild. 

But the night clearly belonged to the man called Shady. Throughout the show, fans yelled his name in anticipation, then roared around 9:15 p.m. when the lights went out and the curtains slowly opened, revealing a circus-like set as a video began to play.The video showcased Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice-President Dick Cheney, and others ranting on numerous television shows and senate hearings bashing hip-hop, some even going as far as to point fingers specifically at Eminem. The crowd got into it big-time. 

Then came the moment the arena had been buzzing over: Eminem, riding down a ferris wheel, stepped on stage and began singing "Squaredance." His electric performance featured songs such as "My Dad's Gone Crazy," "White America" and "Cleaning Out My Closet" from his latest CD, The Eminem Show, as well as classics like "Stan" and "Guilty Conscience" from his two previous Grammy-nominated albums.Joining him on stage was D-12, Eminem's clique from Detroit, rapping to songs like "Purple Pills" and "When the Music Stops." 

Never one to stray from controversy, Eminem paused the show for a pot shot at techno musician Moby. Moby was depicted as a space cadet puppet who attempted to fly off-stage only to be shot down by Obi Trice, one of Em's cronies. 

Eminem was both sincere and graceful on stage, displaying a true appreciation for his fans, and even going as far as to say that he'd "be nothing without them" and "We love you, South Florida."

Loud music, $30 t-shirts and $4 bottles of water - what more could you expect from a concert?  All in all, everyone seemed to leave happy; I sure did. Then again, standing in the front row listening to your favorite rap artist and not being able to hear anything for three days will do that to you.

Headline: "FearDotCom" indulges in horror cliches
Author: Heather Brummer
&nbsp;
The problem with the thriller "FearDotCom" is that it doesn't make much sense. Every movie should have a logical story to tell, so that when it's all over, a viewer is left with something. "Feardotcom" only leaves us confused.

The film centers (as best as anyone can tell) around one very bad website, the redundant www.FearDotCom.com. This is not a site you want to visit, no matter how tempting it may seem. If you refuse to listen to the warnings, as most victims do in this film, you will log on and die within 48 hours. 

A central problem here is that although four characters die after checking out the website, it is never actually explained how they die. The site must send out some sort of subliminal message to those who log on. 

What the audience sees is merely a glimpse of what the website actually looks like and all we know about it is that once you enter, a woman greets you, asking such unintentionally amusing questions as "Do you like to watch?" and: "Do you want to hurt me?" 

By the time she has asked this four or five times, our answer to the second question is a qualified yes. 

There is also a crazy doctor who enjoys mutilating women so that everyone can see, hence the very direct MPAA warning which cites "violence, including grisly images of torture, nudity and language."

Not elaborating may be one of the better directorial choices, as it leaves us wondering what exactly the voyeurs are seeing, which brings us to a slightly different point: Although the plot is, at best, unclear, the cinematography of this film makes it bearable.  

 "FearDotCom" makes no sense, but in no way does it lack great cinematography. Having been shot in Luxembourg, New York, a place where even daylight is often dark, the film's frequent darkness and overcast days should leave you a bit chilled. 

There are moments when you may find yourself wishing the sun would come up already. Of course, when the sun is out, it doesn't really matter. Many of the scenes are filmed inside buildings, usually frightening and deserted ones where the only life present is that of an endangered person. 

The New York subway system adds to the film's suspense. In fact, if you didn't know any better, you would think trains were an integral part of the plot. In the opening scene, a man wanders into the subway at night, his eyes bleeding, and stumbles into virtual emptiness. The only sound surrounding him, other than his own footsteps, is that of a bouncing ball which just happens to be attached to one of the most frightening children ever viewed on screen. Pay close attention and you may start to understand what that scary little girl has to do with the movie. 

All in all, "FearDotCom" is not going to receive any nominations this year (unless someone happens to take a good look at its cinematography, an area in which it showed definite potential), but it's not the worst flick out there. 

If we consider that it does contain several themes that are a staple of horror movies (blood, gore, torture, frightening characters and one's own worst fears), we may actually begin to believe that the film is not all bad. Perhaps if it had been explained a bit more thoroughly, "FearDotCom" would not have left us, quite literally, in the dark.

Headline: Literary "Possession" follows two affairs
Author: Christina Kent
&nbsp;
As a director who is known for being brutally straightforward about the politics of relationships, Neil Labute attempts to make his first serious romantic debut in an adaptation of A.S. Byatt's best-selling novel "Possession." After Labute's previous farcical films ("Nurse Betty" and "In the Company of Men"), it came as a surprise that he would take on this exacting saga of two couples in different eras. 

The modern-day duo, tight-lipped Maud Bailey and grisly Roland Mitchell (Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart) are English literary scholars who meet in Yorkshire to investigate century-old love letters Mitchell found in between the pages of a library book. The letters happen to be written by the renowned (fictitious) poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam). Ash and his secret lover,bi-sexual poet Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle), provide the captivatingly dramatic portion of the film as their mysterious romance unravels. 

Paltrow and Eckhart are both easy on the eyes, although their characters were robbed of an even semi-effective script due to the fact that they continuously mirror the lines of the "legendary" poets. This is because at least one-fourth of the movie features them reciting love letters to one another in seductively confrontational locations such as dark attics and Victorian hotel rooms. 

Still determined to be a clever film, "Possession" chugs on with more saucy details of the antique romance paired with irritatingly awkward fully-clothed "forbidden" love scenes from the past. While the old-fashioned couple acts out their obsession with each other, the modern couple persistently denies their growing adoration. 

The plot makes you anxious for Maud and Roland's budding relationship to work out – but when it finally does, it seems somewhat obligatory for their roles and less natural than it should have been. 

Paltrow's character leaves you frustrated by her frosty stance on love, while the miscast Eckhart makes you cringe at his naïve demeanor. Perhaps Labute is trying to spoof modern day romances with this fluky match: that man plus woman is a recipe for petty disputes and they will have little to talk about unless they are occupationally united.

The determined researchers get in the car and revisit almost every place Randolph and Christabel escaped to. They even stop by the home of Maud's senile relatives whose attic, unbeknownst to them, has an abundance of letters hidden in a doll carriage that help fill in the "puzzle" of the old romance for the young scholars. (Yes, Maud is distantly related to Christabel LaMotte, making the story even more plausible.) Landscapes of the breathtakingly green countryside and flourishing waterfalls are what keep the film alive – at least visually.

By the end, the perfectly cheesy romance of Paltrow and Eckhart seems more forced than genuine.  To soften it up a bit, Labute could have stuck in a little more wit besides the hilarious gag that Eckhart's character is (haha) an American. The film manages to establish itself as a cinematographically lush spectacle, yet lacks in originality of script and circumstance.

Headline: "GZNY" remembers attack victims through theatre
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
For its second show,  "GZNY" is aiming for a global reaction. A theatrical tribute to the victims who perished at ground zero in New York,  "GZNY" deals with the emotions provoked by last year's terrorist attacks.
The previous production occurred three months after Sept. 11, on Dec. 11, 2001 and was conceived at FIU in Director Phillip Church's "Intro to Acting for Theatre Majors" class. When the attacks took place, Church decided to put aside his normal curriculum and focus all of his class time on creating a tribute show. 
"I absolutely knew that theatre had a responsibility to move beyond and somehow absorb the tragedy, the carnage, the grief, the pain and move it into people's hearts," explained Church. "I knew that theatre had to take in what was happening so that the story could continue as a reminder." 
Church wants "GZNY" to serve as a document of sorts, capturing both the hatred and the courage that can arise between two human beings. 
The show has evolved a bit, becoming more of a lesson in humanity at large than it was before. While there may have been a lot of fear and anger last year, this year the angle has changed and the production examines prejudice and hatred. 
"GZNY" is supposed to serve as a symbol of the events of Sept. 11. Church has made sure that all sides of the affair are represented. The show is only happening on one night, Sept. 11, and it is being staged in Coral Gables' Biltmore Hotel. The location is no accident – like all other aspects of "GZNY," there is a reason for its selection. The Biltmore Hotel was a hospital during World War II and a Veterans hospital well into the sixties. Church thought it would add to "GZNY" if it were presented in a place of healing. "It has a spirit," he said.
"GZNY" is a mixture of monologue, song, dance and demonstrations. All of the included material is based on the writings of the performers, who used everything from newspaper clippings to personal experience for inspiration. Because of the realistic depiction of events, the performers involved are not just FIU students, but various members of the community who were affected by the terrorist events, including some firefighters and policemen. One of the performers is even bringing in a box of items found at Ground Zero in New York City.  	
The performers ended up relating in extremely personal ways to their roles, even though some are playing characters from the other side of the world, or from a different social or ethnic group. Natalia Romero and Jean-Willy Gerdes are both performers who play Muslim characters. Their experiences have allowed both of them to get a better feel for the consequences of war and social oppression. 
Romero, a senior, plays an urban Muslim refugee. Her role put her into the life of these poverty-stricken women and opened her eyes to an existence she never knew before. 
"I have had to learn how to move in my costume, I had to learn the cultural rules. For example, I can't make sudden movements because women are not allowed to do that in a Burka," Romero said. 
Her empathetic experience made her appreciate her own life so much more. 
"They [the Afghani women] are at the bottom of poverty," she said.  "They have no medical attention or freedom; they can't even cross the street because they are unable to look both ways [because of] the Burkas they wear." 
She hopes that her performance will help the rest of America see the other side of the conflict, as she now does. 
Gerdes too, has found a new value for life and his own family. A North Miami resident with a Haitian background, Gerdes is able to relate somewhat easily to playing a Muslim in the United States – at least in respect to being foreigner in a country that tends to be very judgmental when it comes to ethnicity. Gerdes has to speak about profiling and prejudice and portray the hurtful effects these actions have upon the victims. He said Sept. 11 has had an indescribably grounding effect on his life. 
"You feel more precious now with your children, with neighbors. It doesn't matter the color, being human is the key," he said. 
These are the sentiments that Gerdes hopes to infuse into his performance. 
It seems that "GZNY" is completely grounded in good will; Instead of charging for admission, Church will ask for donations that will go towards a high school theatre program that he is in the process of setting up. SGA contributed as well, taking care of the advertising for the show, working with Ronnie Mittleman and Deon Butler of Campus Life Publications to print flyers. 
Church has long-term plans for the show. He wants "GZNY" to be a living memorial, always changing, always developing, "just like history itself." Each year there will be new actors with new stories to tell. He predicts that every year the show will be "paired down" more and more so that eventually, "GZNY" will distill down to the "very essence of the experience."
 Despite all of the individual goals of the "GZNY" team, it all comes down to one common purpose: on September 11, 2002 at 8 p.m., audiences will be freed from whatever it is that is oppressing their spirits. 
"Everyone needs to remove that sense that you are alien – we are all oppressed in some way within ourselves," said Church. "That is what theatre is actually about. It is about freeing people."

Headline: Community events to honor Sept. 11
Author: John Lovell
&nbsp;
Sept. 11, 2002, will mark the anniversary of the day when tragedy struck New York City's World Trade Center. On that day, people all around the world will recognize and pay tribute to the large amount of innocent lives lost, as well as the brave, uniformed individuals who sacrificed their lives to save others and protect our country.  In Miami, and here at FIU, there are several special and patriotically geared events scheduled for this important day of remembrance.

At the James L. Knight Center in Downtown Miami, America's Life Line Foundation has prepared a program entitled "Tribute to America – A Patriotic Event." The evening will be spent paying tribute to the various uniformed organizations that risk their lives everyday to serve and protect the United States.  As part of the program, 1,000 Miami-Dade County Public School children will be performing with their respective choruses, bands and orchestras to honor those who sacrificed their lives one year ago and those who still risk their lives today. 

America's Life Line Foundation serves to provide relief and inspiration for the victims of terrorism and it helps strengthen unity and patriotism while promoting nonviolence through the arts. The foundation's founder, Ann Miller, states that they "want to accomplish this goal through music, a beautiful and universal language most [people] understand and relate to." In addition, several unannounced local and world-renowned guests will be appearing throughout the evening. The festivities begin at 7:30 p.m. 

Additionally, in the "Tribute to America" event, a patriotic work of art constructed and painted by nearly a dozen students from the FIU Department of Art and Art History, will be unveiled. On September 6 and 7, from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., the art students assembled in FIU's painting studio on 117th Street. A team led by Ana Fernandez painted and built a 27-feet Styrofoam replica of the Statue of Liberty. Carol Damian, chairperson of FIU's Department of Art and Art History, said "the art students at FIU are honored to be able to participate in the tribute to America and to be able to contribute with what they do best." Look for the replica-statue at the James L. Knight Center during the patriotic tribute event this Wednesday.

FIU's Wolfsonian Museum will also be holding patriotic festivities by joining in with other institutions around the country in "Museums Celebrate America's Freedoms: A Day of Remembrance."  The Wolfsonian-FIU, located in South Beach, will unveil a special gallery on its 5th floor, which showcases works that address themes of liberty and freedom such as Norman Rockwell's "Four Freedoms." In addition, there will be a free screening of HBO's critically acclaimed documentary, "In Memoriam: New York City 9/11/01." 

The museum will be free to the public on Sept. 11 from noon to 6 p.m. Screenings of the HBO documentary  will take place in the museum's auditorium.  On Tuesday, Sept. 10, the Wolfsonian-FIU will honor the services of the City of Miami Beach Police and Fire Department with a special ceremony that will take place at the museum with city officials and the city's Honor Guard.  The Wolfsonian-FIU is located on 1001 Washington Ave., Miami Beach.

It is very important that we do something to honor the services of those men and women who gave their lives to our nation last year and who continue to serve and protect our communities today. Participating in or attending events like these is important in strengthening the unity of our nation. All of the above events are free for all to attend and should be taken advantage of, as this day has become an important landmark in the history of the United States.
