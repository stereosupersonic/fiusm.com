Headline: Student Organizations Council: Treasurer, marketing director ousted by votes
Author: Elvis Ramirez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Organizations Council at Biscayne Bay Campus will be holding a special election to fill the treasurer and marketing director positions on Dec. 6.

The special election will be part of the semester's last SOC general meeting.

SOC club representatives will vote on candidates for both positions. 

The election will be closed to students who are not members of an SOC registered club.

Daniela Dias, former SOC-BBC treasurer, resigned Oct. 29. 

Dias claimed she was too busy, according to SOC-BBC Vice President Didier "D.J." Georges. 

Georges said Dias resigned because most of her attention is focused at University Park where most of her classes are held.

Danai Cheretis was removed from the marketing director position during SOC's Nov. 1 general meeting.

"The vote was unanimous," Mintz said. "Probably because she wasn't showing up." 

Both Dias and Cheretis had not been into the Campus Life office since the beginning of October, according to Georges. 

"We had one [executive board] meeting in the month of September and that was the last time that the group worked together, and that was early September.  

"Ever since I got elected, she hasn't been in the office. She came maybe two or three times," Georges said. "If an SOC official has not worked at the office for more than two weeks they are suspended."

Mintz sent e-mails letting botDias and Cheretis know they had been suspended. Dias chose to resign.

Cheretis had initially resigned but later chose to remain in her position. However, she did not attend the next SOC general meeting.

"[After she agreed to come back] that was the last time that I heard from her," said Georges.

SOC sent her a "firm" e-mail asking her to decide within the week whether she would return or not and Cheretis did not respond, according to Georges. 

"We offered her a chance to defend herself but she didn't show up," said Mintz. "We lost contact with her."

Mintz said SOC-BBC tried e-mailing and calling Cheretis but she never responded.

Ivy Seigel, SOC-BBC's advisor, mentioned Cheretis was vague the last time she responded to SOC-BBC.

The change did not cause any panic because Mintz, Georges, Sabrina Saint Jour, SOC-BBC's secretary and Jessica Castillo, the events coordinator, had been handling the work even before the resignations, said Georges.

"It's basically been the four of us for a while, anyway," Georges said.

Seigel was also unfazed by the sudden resignations.

"Change happens, change is good. "It will give other students the opportunity to get this experience," Seigel said.

The council is trying to let students know these positions are available and encourage applications. 

Superhero themed flyers have been posted throughout BBC, while SOC's president and vice president have been visiting classrooms to recruit students.

"We've already run out of applications. "We've restocked but we did run out quickly," Mintz said.

Applications for the treasurer and marketing director positions are available at the Campus Life office in WUC 141. 

Cheritis and Dias did not respond despite several attempts to contact them.

Headline: Despite loss, husband thankful for what he still has
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
"I made it to Baghdad safe."

This was the last text message Raymond Clamens received from his wife Lillian on Oct 8.

Two days later, she would have been home to be with her husband and three children: Victoria, 7, Lonna, 8 and Ayinde, 14. 

But she wasn't. On Oct. 10, she died after several mortar rounds struck Camp Victory in Baghdad. 

The staff sergeant was among the two that died and 78 injured in the surprise attack. 

This Thanksgiving would have been the first time in three years that the Clamens family would have been together for Thanksgiving. 

"The kids and I were looking forward to her coming home," Clamens, 33 said. "I'm usually the one that's gone for the holidays."

Now the Clamens family will be spending their Thanksgiving in Orlando at Raymond's mother's house. Raymond said the he has been trying to keep himself and the kids busy to help get past this difficult time. 

"You got to keep moving. You got to get back to work and the kids back to school. Getting back into a normal routine kind of helps," said Clamens, now retired from the Army for 11 years.

Lillian, 35, was an administrative clerk stationed in Tallil who had been away from home since July 2006. 

Like all soldiers going home, she was transferred to Camp Victory in Baghdad. The attack occurred as she and a group of soldiers were on their way to dinner. 

"From what I gathered, the attack came from a pick-up truck that was parked by a school near the base," Clamens said.

He first heard about the attack while at a Miami Heat preseason game.

 He received a call from his cousin's son, who was baby-sitting his children. 

"When I found there was an officer sitting there at 10:30 at night at my house, I pretty much assumed it couldn't be anything else," Clamens said said.

Clamens, who works in FIU's ROTC program as a supply technician, has received a lot of support from his family and the Army but said that he just needs to keep moving forward with his life. 

 "[Working in the Army] makes it easier because you know how the whole process works. Being a solider, it helps you understand how things work and happen. It's kind of rough but you'll make it."

The couple met in 1996 when Raymond made his first tour to Germany. 

He had gone out one night to celebrate a course he had just completed and saw her at a local club.

"I saw her across the bar as I was getting a drink," he said. "I was looking at her and I thought she was looking at somebody else. I raised my eyebrow, she raised her eyebrow at me and that was it. Eleven years later, we were together."

Clamens described Lillian as a person who knew how to cheer everyone up when things weren't going well. 

"Everybody who came in contact with her, whether it be five minutes or five years, remembered her. She was that type of person. She was always willing to help people and that's what she loved to do." Clamens said.

Despite the loss, Raymond said that he and his family still count their blessings and appreciate everything that they still have.

"I'm just thankful for all my family and friends that are still here and the fact that the kids are doing well. Lillian was the type of person that did not want you sitting around moping. She would want everyone to be happy and move on."

Headline: Body Art: Female bodies become canvases at Jazid's upstairs lounge
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Copy Chief
&nbsp;
Graffiti artists love to place their art in unique places around the city; Arthur Baute places his art uniquely around the areola.

Baute, a local artist who also goes by the name Mxytsplyk, uses the female body to execute his art on. He paints on a different body every Monday at One Mic Mondays, which takes place in the upstairs lounge of Miami Beach's Jazid, 1342 Washington Avenue.

"We try to have different girls every time; it is something to look forward to," Baute said. "The girls are the surface for my art. Every bend and curve of those girls morphs the patterns and figures. My art is about layers and the placement of layers so the absurdity of the iconography I use can blend in harmony."

Bringing Baute to paint at One Mic was the idea of the event's creator Magen Herrera. She wanted people to not only listen to music, have a couple drinks and dance; she wanted people to sit down with some friends and actually watch something beautiful be created.

"Honestly, I couldn't see how anyone would be against or offended by body painting, it's art on art," she said.

When coming up with ideas on what to paint on the girls Baute uses pop culture as his inspiration. 

"My sources for inspiration usually come from pop culture and common knowledge, intensely. My roots of fine art and graffiti are a major element in the paintings, Baute said. "Graffiti is about vandalizing and disrupting the public lifestyle. I personally believe it's just another layer of paint that eventually will be covered as well. The girls I paint are like the wall being tagged on."

Along with painting on bodies, Baute also showcases many of his original pieces at the venue. Artwork perceived by the film Gummo or Blondie's lead woman Debbie Harry surround the artist as he paints. 

Some might argue that Baute's art is similar to tattooing, but he is quick to define the fine line between tattoos and body painting.

"I've never been satisfied with one image. It would be painful for me to see that image for the rest of my life on my forearm," Baute said. "Other than regretting your decision - making in 10 years with a blotchy blue crucified panther inked inside your skin - tattoos are permanent, body painting is not."

Regulars TO One Mic can point out the familiar faces of those they have partied with in past weeks. One of those regulars, Lionel Rodriguez, comes for the art and the occasional break dancing.  

"It sometimes feels as though the night moves around him," said Rodriguez about Baute. "People gather around to see him paint and to look at a beautiful naked woman. "I start breaking it down sometimes, but I have a good time when others join me."

The crowd at One Mic is one that Herrera describes as appreciative toward good music and vibes; people looking for some laughs and surreal experiences.

"[My art] sort of resembles the people who come here ... it becomes really surreal when I stop focusing on the subject and look around. I see a collage of people observing me and some off in the distance breaking on the floor to a delectable sound," Baute said. 

According to Herrera, the music selection at One Mic is also what keeps familiar faces attending. Dubstep, a distinguished music style with a dark mood, sparse rhythms and emphasis on bass, is played at the lounge on many occasions.

"We have [DJ] Mr. Alvarez spinning non-commercial hip-hop, funk, local and down-tempo jams. One Monday out of the month we have a dub-step extravaganza, where aside from spinning some sick dub-step, Mr. Alvarez and beatmaker Name Brand actually do

some live performances with local acts like Knome of EM2 on the microphone."

Jazid's downstairs currently lends itself to various jazz ensembles and rock bands; with no correlation to its upstairs counterpart. There are plans to integrate both very soon, though.

"We are in the process of booking some great artists for the month of February downstairs, Herrera said.

One Mic's future is  to be a little different each night, varying it up between live acts, more artists and more music.

"This is something people couldn't even really plan; what I strive to create at One Mic," Herrera said. "A kind of surreal night that at least I find, hasn't really been offered as a weekly event here in Miami."

Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The worn, black and white Nike shoes will sit next to the sliced turkey this year as they do every year.

They did not belong to a deceased family member, as guests often assume. They are six years old, have torn soles and are covered in thin, greasy streaks.

Elias Tabares, 20, used them for several months in 2002 whenever he played basketball with friends; they were also his first Thanksgiving Day presents.

"My parents thought we had to exchange gifts. We were new here and didn't know Thanksgiving had no gifts. We've kept them ever since," Tabares said.

Elias' father, Joaquin, bought him the sneakers for their first Thanksgiving in this country in 2001. 

Originally from Mendoza, Argentina, the family moved to Broward around the holiday season to escape the economic crisis then plaguing their country. Joaquin, a successful cook and restaurant owner, feared he would become another in the nation's army of cartoneros - middle class men reduced to picking cardboard off the streets after losing their jobs."Our house was small, but it had a large fence. The restaurant was right across the street and the boys came to help out after school. We had it nice there," Joaquin, 52, said.

The Tabares clan was "comfortably middle class," as Joaquin likes to say. Elias and his two brothers played soccer with a neighborhood team on weekends; their mother, Rosa, had tea parties at home every month."My father did well and took care of us. What else could we want?" Elias said.

Black Friday - the popular nickname for the day after Thanksgiving - was the second busiest shopping day of 2006, according to the National Retail Sales Estimate. 

Joaquin was standing in line at an electronics store on Black Friday, 2002 when he began to laugh to himself. He had a list of items for the whole family and he knew it'd take him the entire day to find them all.

"I saw myself standing in line with my sons at 5 a.m. waiting to buy machines we probably wouldn't even need and I thought, 'What happiness!'" he said.

President George W. Bush has frequently encouraged the American people to "shop more" to help the country's economy, according to an NPR report.

During the famed "Kitchen Debate" of 1959, Vice President Richard Nixon argued the benefits of capitalism with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev by showing him the exhibit of a modern house "any steelworker could buy," complete with a new, color television along with many other modern amenitites.

"It's not a sin to want to work and be comfortable," Joaquin said.

Rosa was the one who set the shoes on the table in 2003, after Joaquin shared his epiphany with her. The sneakers have become a tradition, a symbol of the good life the Tabares clan were allowed to continue in another country.

Elias attends community college and plans to go into business. His father is the top cook at an Italian restaurant in Plantation and Rosa and her new friends gossip while sipping lattes at a Starbucks.

"We don't have to worry [that] the day will come when we'll live in the streets," Joaquin said. "We're not afraid to be happy here."

Headline: Review: Manhunt 2 (Game)
Subheadline: Graphic sequel fails to move forward
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Video game developer Rockstar Games has been a lightning rod for criticism due to their rampant and sometimes graphic depictions of violence in their games.  

While Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto franchise has become a commercial success due in part to its satire of crime and pop culture, Manhunt has drawn notoriety primarily for its vivid depictions of murderous brutality. Now, with its sequel on Sony's Playstation 2, Playstation Portable and the Nintendo Wii, the carnage continues.

While the original Manhunt was a fight for survival, Manhunt 2's story is more of a fight for sanity.  Daniel Lamb, once an ordinary citizen, finds himself locked away with fellow inmate Leo Kasper in an asylum for the criminally insane. A power outage allows for their escape and, as Daniel, the player must piece together his past, uncover something called "The Project" and fight his pursuers. The plot works well with the nature of the game but is spoiled by being so paper-thin. Most players will likely figure out the main plot twist within five minutes of starting the game.

The game play isn't much different from the original. Lamb can hide in the shadows and use sound to lure or distract his enemies and sneak in for the kill with whatever object the player can find; a ball-point pen, plastic bag, crowbar, firearm or even a toilet, manhole or fuse box. Gunplay and melee combat are also in the mix but don't fare as well as the stealth aspects. The control mechanics are also the same as in the original and they work just as well.  Because the game lacks replay value, it spans a good length with two possible endings. The main issue with Manhunt 2 is that it is so much like the first Manhunt with only a few changes in the story and setting.

Despite the fact that the game is made for the relatively dated PS2 system, Manhunt 2's graphics are nothing short of graphic. The game did have to be censored from an initial "adults only" rating for release, but that still does not change the fact that it is not for the faint-hearted.  The negative photo filter during Daniel's kills is a clever move to censor the violence while furthering the game's portrayal of his twisted psyche - his killings are still quite viewable. The grainy video effects, along with settings such as the asylum, a fetish club and an underground torture ring; environments clearly influenced by films like Saw and Hostel, further perpetuate the dark aura of Manhunt 2. Foreboding music and ambient sounds linger menacingly throughout the game and each bludgeon, stab, moan and scream audibly heighten the already gruesome experience.

Manhunt 2's more-of-the-same approach is not terrible by any means, and the game is still competent in delivering murderous thrills.  Fans of the original can feel right at home while those expecting the sequel to surpass the original will likely be disappointed. Regardless, Rockstar Games delivers Manhunt 2 and its shock with no apologies.

Headline: Homecoming: Parading Panthers show University pride
Subheadline: Man in monkey suit helps win float contest
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Giant floats sporting FIU colors circled the University on Friday Nov. 16 at 6 p.m. during FIU's homecoming parade; one of the last events before the football game against the Louisiana Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns.

"The parade is pretty much to spread school spirit around," said Daniel Estevez, one of the students in charge of organizing homecoming events.  

ROTC led the parade in full uniform while saluting the American flag, with the homecoming court and four floats trailing behind. Members of the FIU marching band, The Band of the Sun, also played to help create panther pride. 

The floats took off from parking lot three while the students riding them enthusiastically displayed their logos around campus.

Around different areas of the school, cheer zones were set up for students to show their panther spirit and root for their favorite organizations. Only one organization was allowed per cheer zone.

"Homecoming is always great to get to know different organizations," Arenas said.

The parade ended in the middle of the gold and blue parking garages, where a stage stood ready for FIU Ultra. The concert and block party featuring disc jockey Irie and DJ Danny Daze, started at 8 p.m. and went on until 2 a.m..

Anitere Flores, a 1997 FIU graduate and member of the 

Florida House of Representatives, was the grand marshal of the parade and Mario Cristobal, head football coach, kicked off the six-hour Ultra block party, in which the winners of some of the competitions held during the week were announced.

According to Eliza Arenas, a junior in charge of the event, this was the first on-campus parade. 

All the homecoming parades before this year have gone out into the streets surrounding FIU.

"This year we are kind of limited to how much we can promote school spirit," Arenas said.

In the past, the parade usually took place on Saturday before the football game, which would allow police to close the streets around campus. 

Because the homecoming game was played at the Orange Bowl instead of on campus, the parade had to be organized differently this year. 

Arenas thought there would have been more school spirit if the parade had taken place earlier in the day instead of at 5 p.m., a time when most students are traditionally not on campus. 

Most students who participated in the parade, especially in the construction of the floats, were members of fraternities, sororities and student organizations.

The floats took about a month to put together and were decorated using a new technique called pomping. 

In pomping, small sheets of colored tissue paper, called pomps, are pasted on a board in order to construct a picture. The floats also had many lights for visibility at night. 

Although those who participated in the construction of the floats say it took a lot of time and effort, they proudly displayed figures like Roary the Panther, our school mascot, despite the complexity involved. 

"I think the skill and the amount of work going into these floats is getting better and better every year," Arenas said.

Headline: Commentary: STREAK CONTINUES...Don't turn your backs on team yet
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the offense humming and the team down by just one score heading into the half, there should have been, at the very least, some sort of buzz in the crowd of the Orange Bowl as FIU tried valiantly to end the highly publicized losing streak they are currently mired in against the University of Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns.

However, a great majority of the crowd seemed more interested in the outcome of the various homecoming awards, and by the time quarterback Wayne Younger was sacked on 4th down with 2 minutes left in the game and FIU down by just seven, more than half of the paltry 5,734 fans who showed up had headed for the exits. 

Of course, when a team has lost 22 in a row and consistently, and at this point predictably, comes out flat in the second half, it is hard to fault a crowd for being uninterested. 



While the offense looked sharper than it has at any point in the season, and Younger and running back A'Mod Ned continue their maturation into two of the more exciting play makers in the Sun Belt Conference, the defense was once again the weak point, failing at any point to stop the Cajuns' rushing game.

And while it has been easy enough to use the excuse that the talent isn't there this year, that simply wasn't the case in this game, as the coaching staff didn't seem to make the necessary adjustments at halftime. The Cajuns' offense essentially ran two simple plays out of their hurry up shot gun offense, a HB dive and a designed bootleg pass, and the defense wasn't able to stop them.

You have to question the coaching staff's decision to not load up against the run and force the Cajuns' to try and beat them through the air.

Despite how difficult this loss was, it is of course important to remember that this is still a team that is the very definition of a work in progress, and as head coach Mario Cristobal made abundantly clear prior to the season, this is a building year, and in that way the game wasn't all bad.

It is extremely encouraging to watch Younger quiet the skeptics (one of whom was me at the beginning of the season) with his strong play. He isn't there yet, but he showed flashes of brilliance in this game, and not just with his legs.

He is starting to make the right decisions with the ball, as evidenced by his first game without a interception since the opening game against Penn State. If not for his receivers dropping passes, Younger could've had an even better day, although it is hard to argue with a 3 touchdown performance.

Ned also continued to show why he is the number one back on the team, with an incredibly impressive 20 carry, 152 yard day which included a brilliant 60 yard run to give FIU an early 14-7 lead. While he has had to fight to even get back to the line of scrimmage as defenders got in his face with ease, with a strong day from the line, he was able to show his play making abilities. 

Another player who had a strong was sophomore linebacker Michael Dominguez, who has found himself in and out of the starting lineup and who didn't even start in this game, but who racked up 19 tackles nonetheless. This performance may have put him back in the starting linebacker rotation.

As a small digression on the topic of the crowd, something I noticed in this game and have noticed for much of the season, it seems like large portions of the crowd were more concerned with cheering for their own favorite players over the actual team. 

I am not begrudging those who go to games and represent their organizations, but it is frustrating to watch a group like Panther Rage, for example, whose constitution says their goal is to "promote athletic events on campus, sponsor events that will raise attendance at Athletic events, and support the Florida International University Athletic teams," supporting specific players ahead of the team itself, going so far as to create signs to hold up and starting chants during the game.

Obviously it is anyone's prerogative to support who they see fit, it would be nice to at least see what little fan base the team may have rooting for the name on the front, not the names on the back. 

This is a team that, despite it's record, isn't far off from competing within it's conference, as shown by it's close losses to the defending Sun Belt Conference co-Champions in the past 2 games, and it's far too early in the program's history for the fan's to begin turning on it. While a loss is still a loss, this game can be looked at positively, if it was more than a little frustrating.

Headline: Opa-Locka ban trivial: New law prohibits low-slung pants on public property
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Late last month, the city of Opa-Locka banned anyone from wearing pants below the waistline on city property.  

According to USA Today, at least eight states have proposed bills aimed to ban the public wearing of baggy pants, a fashion with origins often attributed to the hip hop culture.

News outlet WPLG reported Opa-Locka city commissioner Timothy Holmes as citing "concern about trying to teach the kids how to grow up and be a better person for themselves" as the rationale for the ordinance.  

In a city with remarkably high crime rates, Opa-Locka boasts a murder rate five times the national average, it seems out of place to enforce a law on something this trivial.

The ordinance only affects public property and the only enforcement method is that police can demand violators leave city property.  

No fines or jail time come along with the punishment.

Regardless, the idea of governments mandating how citizens can and cannot dress has attracted much criticism since Virginia was the first to try to ban baggy pants two years ago, according to USA Today. 

Supporters of such a ban often cite that underwear can be seen when pants sag and link baggy pants to gang violence and prison culture. 

A common rumor is that the baggy pant fashion started in prison as a way for male inmates to signal to other males that they were ready and willing to engage in homosexual sodomy. 

According to Snopes.com, the popular urban legend reference denies this; however it says that the prison origin of this trend was simply due to inmates being issued clothes too large and not being allowed to wear belts.  

In the early 1990s, the fashion statement made it out of the slammer and onto hip hop album covers, such as that of Ice-T and Snoop Dogg. 

"I don't want to see underwear in public" said Bridget Linnehan, a freshman majoring in nursing who supports the ban.

However, freshman Givens Cherilus is concerned about it. 

"I doubt that it's constitutional," Cherilus said.

Whether or not such a ban violates our Constitution can only be decided in a court. 

Needless to say, the ordinance is a waste of time and money for the city. 

Though city officials claim no arrests will be made, if a person is asked to leave by a police officer and refuses, they can be charged with trespassing and arrested.  

It is not clear if Opa-Locka would go this far in enforcing the law.

  If they do not, the ordinance will be in effect unenforceable, and if they do, city resources will be used to prosecute a petty offense.

Enforcement of this ordinance is also likely to cause anti-police sentiment.  

With the increased violence against police in South Florida in the recent months causing the deaths of two Broward sheriff deputies, as well as a Miami-Dade police officer, an ordinance that further puts a wedge between law enforcement and the general public is hardly the direction we should be moving in, as far as public relations is concerned.

Ban-supporters are also concerned with the fact that underwear, usually boxers, are exposed when baggy pants are worn.  

While this is indeed unpleasant, in terms of what is being exposed, a woman wearing a see-through shirt with a black bra or a man in Speedos at the beach show much more than a person wearing baggy pants with last season's Christmas boxers. 

There may be at least one economic reason to support this ban, however.

"If we [don't] allow baggy pants, belt companies will go out of business," Linnehan said.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Parking and Transportation burdens students with harsh collection measures
Author: Chris Carbot / Graduate student
&nbsp;
To some degree we have become desensitized to the constant issues presented by the often "Survivor" like situation surrounding parking. 

However, I was particularly appalled to learn that Parking and Transportation is now submitting outstanding citations to collection agencies. 

This remains a stark contrast to the incompetence and bureaucracy involved when the institution is on the hook for a payment, whether it be of scholarship funds or some sort of fee. 

Perhaps I should have hired an agency to collect my scholarship funds during my undergraduate days, which apparently were always lost in a back office somewhere until the last month of the semester. 

Frankly, the department, and by extension the University, should be embarrassed for turning to the employment of mercenary agencies for the collection of $25 parking tickets.

It hardly seems reasonable to damage a college student's credit, and therefore ability to purchase a home and the like, over a comparatively petty parking violation. 

This is particularly troublesome when one considers the commission costs typically associated with such agencies, meaning that not only is the department's collection method damaging to students, but arguably financially irresponsible as well.

To say the least, it is disappointing to think that tuition dollars and financial resources, better spent elsewhere, are being used to strong-arm ticket payments out of students - with damaged credit scores as an extra bonus for the trouble. 

If the department wishes to engage in such hard-line measures, a much cheaper alternative for all involved would be to more vehemently cut off a student's ability to function within the University setting, perhaps by locking a student out of course registration and freezing financial aid.

Essentially at the end of the semester, a student would have to choose between paying the ticket and discontinuing their studies.

Headline: Editorial: Maidique earns top grade, still needs some improvement
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Grades are out and President Modesto "Mitch" Maidique earned top marks. 

At the last Board of Trustees meeting, Maidique was evaluated by a comittee that assesses how well he is doing his job.

He earned 5-out-of-5 points; a superior rating, even though Bruce Hauptli, chair of the Faculty Senate, proposed Maidique receive 4-out-of-5 points, a "good" rating, instead. 

Hauptli sighted Maidique's shortcomings in academic compliance and non-public fundraising as the reason for lowering the President's score. 

Though the committee gave him a perfect score, they did mention that the President needed to improve in the areas in question. These issues are vital to the University's success.

The University cannot count on any help from the Florida legislature at a time when budget cuts are the name of the game and public universities state-wide are pinching pennies simply to meet their obligations to students.

Departments University-wide are reaching monetary breaking points, where they will be forced to compromise services they provide for students. It's going to get to the point where the quality of services provided, including classes is going to be compromised. 

The University is coming to students to help fund various initiative like a growing Athletics program. If the funds aren't there, they put the burden on other departments and students?

With the College of Medicine preparing for its inaugural year and the Athletics department always needing more funds no matter what, the importance of private funding cannot be overstated.

Hauptli was probably referencing the loss of a $25 million donation by former Board of Trustees member Herber Wertheim. Even though a $5 million donation was made to the Medical School, it still isn't going to soften the blow of $25 million  that would have been matched dollar for dollar by the state. 

Though Maidique has taken FIU to a new level by adding a School of Law and College of Medicine, it's now time to focus on improving from within, rather than growing too fast and strecthing resources too thin.

Headline: Board of Trustees: President  makes the grade
Subheadline: Maidique gets 'A' for evaluation
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst News Director
&nbsp;
The Board of Trustees met Nov. 16 at the College of Business Complex to discuss and vote on various initiatives. Of the issues discussed, the rating of University President Modesto Maidique was among them. 

"We felt the president really pursued a very strong vision that he's laid out, [and] continues to lay out," Betsy Atkins, who sits on the BOT, said. 

Atkins chairs the new committee within the BOT, whose purpose is to rate the current University president. The committee now uses a five-point system scale instead of the three-point scale previous committees used to rate Maidique. 

Atkins said that the five-point evaluation scale is more reflective of other university evaluation methods and corporations.

While Maidique originally received the highest rating of superior (or five), Kirk Landon who sits on the BOT, raised concerns over Maidique's low score on compliance and non-public fund-raising areas. 

Following Landon, Bruce Hauptli, chair of the Faculty Senate, also raised his concerns over Maidique's evaluation score. 

"I believe the process has just not improved much, but it's a workable and excellent process," Hauptli said. "But I do have concerns. I am concerned with the performance in two areas that are identified in the report; non-public fund-raising and compliance, especially academic compliance. My belief is [that Maidique's grade] is a B not an A."

Hauptli then proposed an amendment to Maidique's rating score, changing it from superior to the second highest score of good (or four). Following his proposed amendment, Atkins came to her committee's defense. 

"We were very rigorous in challenging and asking questions," Atkins said.

The proposed amendment failed with only two votes of support.  

Aside from Maidique's rating, the BOT discussed several financial matters including current fund-raising initiatives.

"The United Way campaign is underway under the leadership of Mitch Maidique, Bruce Hauptli and Stephen Sauls and I know they have all worked hard on the campaign," David Parker, chairman of the BOT, said. "I do intend to contribute FIU's United Way Campaign."

Hauptli responded that he would be sure to remind Parker, as well as the rest of the BOT to donate to the charity. Private fund-raising goals that would benefit FIU were raised to $30 million. 

As of Oct. 31, FIU has secured $12.3 million in new cash, gifts and pledges according to Joseph L. Caruncho, chair of the dean's council for the College of Business Administration. 

The funds raised will benefit the College of Medicine and other FIU programs according to Caruncho, which will be vital with looming budget cuts of $7.7 million. According to Landon, the cuts were not as harsh as originally expected, but additional cuts could be expected next year.

The 5 percent tuition increase that was proposed by the state legislature during a special session and approved by Governor Charlie Crist was also voted on by the BOT. In a unanimous decision the BOT voted to approve the increase at FIU.  

The BOT and state legislature  are currently in court about who has the right to set tuition for public universities.

Maidique announced his hope that the Board of Governors will win its Supreme Court case giving it power to set tuition rates. 

"There is some uncertainty as to exactly what may happen," Maidique said.

Headline: Professor inspired to create film dealing with college life
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a cup of coffee and a bagel at hand, associate professor Phillip M. Church was puzzled by music videos he saw on the MTV-U television located in the Graham Center at  University Park.

"The words are trying to say something but somehow the imagery wasn't necessarily joining it - visually it's not in sync and it wasn't telling me anything," Phillip Church said. 

 Church created a film, 'Loners not Losers," in order to send a message to students about depression, isolation, violence and other related issues. He was motivated by the events at Columbine and Virginia Tech. 

The purpose of the film is to show students they are not the only ones who may feel overwhelmed by their surroundings and that there are ways of getting help. 

He wanted to emphasize that violence is not the answer to their problems. 

"Phillip Church told me why he was doing the video and what inspired him and I was like, 'Yeah, I want to be involved in this," said Michelle Gonzalez, the lead vocalist for the video and FIU graduate student. "I'm excited to do it; I think it's a very strong message," she said. 

The film was written and directed by Church; music was done by Armando Tranquilino and art direction and editing by Anton Church,.

"I hope that it sheds some light on the common problems that students [who] are lost on many levels on campus [are facing] - problems of isolation, feeling lonely, feeling misunderstood," Tranquilino said.

I also hope it sheds some light on teachers, professors [and] counselors because often times, teachers don't know how to advise a student who is having problems."

The film was developed by the College of Architecture and The Arts in hopes of having it as a mandatory showing, hopefully by the Spring  2008 semester, according to Jessica Rodriguez, public relations student assistant in the Architecture department.

The 20-minute film was sponsored by The Audrey Love Charitable Foundation and What If Productions. 

Filming began this past summer at  UP and will feature different scenes that students can relate to, such as the fear of graduating and not knowing whether or not a successful future will follow or being overwhelmed by the complexity college life offers.

Alain Mesa plays a college senior who is about to graduate, but doesn't have any confidence for what awaits  him after college. 

Ginelle Rosenberg plays a freshman making the transition from high school to college.

"You feel the weight of all this knowledge that is contained within these buildings," Church said, commenting on how an incoming freshman may feel when beginning college. "It's pretty overwhelming for a young person making that shift."

Church's ideal goal is for the video to have mandatory play once every Fall semester, and possibly in orientation for incoming freshmen. 

Church plans on speaking to the provost to require teachers to screen the video.

University President Modesto A. Maidique is expected to attend the event. 

Other guest speakers include Dr. Sean Keniff of CBS-4 with special guest Mark Rosenberg, the Chancellor State University System of Florida. 

The event will begin Nov. 19 at 7 p.m. in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center Concert Hall. 

It will start with a 30-minute reception where free food and drinks will be provided. Afterwards guests will  be led to GC where the film will be shown.

Headline: Mayor to discuss unique path to office at lecture
Author: Lauren Agosto / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Miami-Dade County Mayor and FIU alumnus Carlos Alvarez will be having a case of nostalgia Nov. 20 when he returns to campus. He will be discussing "An Atypical Path to the Office," a lecture where the mayor will hold a discussion about his career in government and politics. 

Alex Tirado, president of the Government and Politics Student Association, feels learning about Alvarez's life experiences will greatly benefit students.

"This event will be beneficial to any student who is interested in politics," Tirado said. "He will share insight on how he got involved, what he does now and what his plans are."

Alvarez became Mayor of Miami-Dade County on Nov. 16. 2004. Throughout his 28-year career in public service with the Miami-Dade Police Department, Alvarez was promoted through all of the civil ranks. On March 31, 1997, he was appointed director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, where he served for seven years.

Alvarez graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration from FIU. 

He is currently working on making Miami-Dade County government more efficient and responsive to the needs of residents. According to the Miami-Dade County Web site, miamidade.gov, Alvarez is mainly focusing on the Miami International Airport and the Port of Miami, which combined generate more than $365 billion and 352,000 jobs for the local economy. 

In his administration, the Mayor has implemented the Miami-Dade County 3-1-1 Answer Center which is designed to provide fast, efficient non-emergency service to residents with questions or concerns about the county government.

Alvarez is a supporter of planned growth for the community. He urges the protection of the Urban Development Boundary meant to ensure future generations will have clean water, a stable economy and a good social well-being.

In January 2006, the Mayor implemented his Initiative on Aging program, a series of year-round educational programs and activities specifically geared toward senior citizens. The program has continued to grow and now provides assistance to seniors living in deteriorating or hurricane-damaged homes.

Mayor Alvarez is also working to help the mentally ill in the community. He believes jails are no place for the mentally ill and is working to decriminalize mental illness. His Mental Health Task Force has trained hundreds of police and correctional officers to respond more effectively to cases involving people with mental illness. It also developed mental health diversion facility to assist the mentally ill in our community, the first of its kind.

Roland Potts, treasurer for the Government and Politics Student Association, said the club felt it should have an influential speaker as its first guest.

"In starting a new organization in the law school, we thought it was important to bring someone who was well-known in the community for our first event," Potts said. "Students can learn about how he got to the position he is in now and what his job entails. They can also learn the road a politician takes to get to office."

The Mayor will be available to the community at the event.

"I believe he will have a question and answer section and I believe he will also speak with anyone who approaches him," Tirado said.

"An Atypical Path to the Office" will be held Nov. 20 at 12:30 p.m. in the Rafael Diaz-Balart Law Building auditorium.

Headline: Recycling program makes strides, students work for improvements
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It has been a year, but the University Park's recycling program is struggling, and Students for Environmental Action are still petitioning for change. 

Last November, The Beacon reported that FIU's recycling program was lacking efficiency compared with other state universities, stating that "FIU could be months away from fully implementing a plastic, bottle and glass recycling program, with campus groups such as [Students for Environmental Action] trying to speed up the change."

"The students are not informed and though the recycling program looks good on paper, it's useless if it's not visible enough so that the FIU community can utilize it," Maria Marasigan, a professor in the department of Earth Sciences, said. 

According to Marasigan, the recycling program at FIU falls short because of the scarcity of recycling bins and their obscure locations around campus. 

SEA has brought the recycling bins out of their obscurity, setting up camp in front of the Green Library for the last three weeks, and carrying out petitions and surveys to bring change and visibility to the University's current recycling program.

Student Maria Zapata considers recycling to be so simple that she was surprised when she joined SEA and noticed that the FIU community does not actively practice it. 

"For me it is so basic, you do not need to do a lot, it is just dropping cans into bins," Zapata said.  

Zapata, who is thrilled to see FIU students uniting to make a difference, hopes students will continue the initiative to recycle even when SEA takes its leave from the GL walkway.

The work done by SEA and student turnout at "green" lectures may prove that students are finally taking recycling seriously. 

SEA collected 2,300 signatures and more than 20 large trash bags brimming with plastic milk jugs and aluminum soda cans, not to mention the massive piles of newspapers.  

Green lectures on campus are also generating high attendance.

FIU  is ready to start thinking about the environment, according to Anthony Rionda, lecture coordinator of the Student Government Association, who has helped organize various lectures on environmental topics this semester. 

One of these events, Time Magazine journalist Michael Grunwald's lecture on his book The Swamp: The Everglades, Florida, and the Politics of Paradise, had more than 150 students and professors in attendance. 

Yet, Marasigan believes that a top-down approach is important for change. She hopes that the petition will "show the administration that there is a demand for a better recycling program and that more support needs to be put into it."

"Recycling is a small idea that's been around for a long time and most universities have them, even elementary schools have them. Hopefully, with support from students, faculty and mainly administration, an effective one will be in place and we can see the results as soon as possible,"  Marasigan said. 

The support for the green campus Marasigan is searching for might just be simmering underneath the surface. 

Grunwald pointed out in front of the FIU community on Oct 30 that concern for the environment is emerging because of necessity. 

"This new generation has to fix the mistakes of the old generation. This is a green generation … because it has to be," Grunwald said.

Headline: FIU 28, ULL 38: RUSHING ATTACK
Subheadline: Defense unable to contain Ragin' Cajuns' backfield
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Florida International University Golden Panthers (0-10) lost to the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns (3-8) 38-28 Nov. 17 at the Orange Bowl.

Despite putting out their finest offensive effort of the season, the Golden Panthers were victim to the Ragin' Cajuns seventh ranked rushing attack and up-tempo no huddle offense.

FIU finally found cohesion on the offensive side of the ball, putting up its highest scoring output of the season and totaling 391 yards of total offense.

The problem Saturday night resided with the defense, unable to consistently tackle running backs Tyrell Fenroy and Deon Wallace, the two putting up a combined total of 238 yards on the ground along with three touchdowns. 

"We were trying, but they are a good, strong rushing football team, we knew that coming in," head coach Mario Cristobal said, following the loss. 

Quarterback Wayne Younger had a chance to lead the team down the field and tie the game with three minutes to go, but a holding penalty and a false start after getting a first down put the team in a hole that they could not escape, culminating with Younger being sacked and fumbling on a fourth-and-6.

"We kept our momentum throughout the whole game. The defense showed up and stopped them on their last drive," said ULL quarterback Connor Morel.

Both teams put up some offensive fireworks in the first quarter, posting 14 points apiece. The scoring was topped off by running back A'mod Ned's 60-yard run for a touchdown to tie the score in the closing minutes of the quarter.

It took Younger two plays on the ensuing possession after a fumble by Ragin' Cajun quarterback Michael Desmoreaux to put the Golden Panthers ahead by seven and into unfamiliar territory, going over 20 points for a half for the first time all season.

The rushing game continued to be the key to the offense, as Ned had one of his biggest days as a Golden Panther, putting up 150 yards on 20 attempts while averaging 7.4 per carry. 

Younger, having already cemented himself as the top rushing quarterback in the school's short history, continued to perform to his usual standards, coming up a yard short of a hundred on the ground to go along 127 yards passing and 3 touchdowns. 

One thing that hurt the Golden Panthers was dropped passes, as Greg Ellingson dropped a sure 1st down late in the game to put the offense in a situation to go for a 4th and long, which lead to Younger being sacked.

"A couple of our receivers were good early, dropped some balls later on in the game," Cristobal said.

It was a difficult loss for the Golden Panthers in a number of ways. It marked the second consecutive game that the team had a chance to win in the waning minutes of the game and could not come out victorious.

Furthermore, the game was also highlighted by homecoming as the team played before the second biggest crowd of the season.

The Golden Panthers will look to end the longest losing streak in the nation this Nov. 24  against cross-town rivals Florida Atlantic University and famed coach Howard Schnellenburger at the Orange Bowl.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Team upsets ranked opponent en route to tournament final
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Throughout the season, the Golden Panthers team suffered from a lack of offensive production. They were always one play away from changing the outcome of a game and not being shut out.

They lost to Southern Methodist University 2-0 and Marshall 1-0 during the regular season. 

A rejuvenated offense led by the team's three leading scorers: Juan Guerra, Steven Jair Cabas and Christian Caporaletti would redeem the teams' losses to upset No. 5 SMU and Marshall.

 

FIU 3, SMU 1



It took eleven games for the Golden Panthers to win their first game of the season. 

After wining their next game, Southern Methodist University would end FIU's two-game win streak.

Nearly one month later, the two teams squared off again. This time, however, the usually offensively inept Golden Panthers cashed in three goals to upset No. 5 ranked SMU in the Conference USA Tournament 3-1.

For a team that was shut out a total of eight times this season, the three goals versus the No. 5 ranked SMU was an aberration. 

Like most of the games this season, the Golden Panthers were trailing heading into the second half. The defense had allowed just one goal, and it seemed like the lack of offense would doom them one final time this season.

But the three leading scorers during the season would make their presence felt during the second half.

The second half scoring would come from First Team All-C-USA midfielder Juan Guerra. In the 55th minute of play, he passed by a SMU defender and fired a shot to tie the game 1-1.

Sophomore Christian Caporaletti gave the Golden Panthers the lead later on by netting a pass from Ricardo Ferrer, making the score 2-1.

The defense tightened up in the second half despite missing defender and team captain Raoul Voss, who was out with a knee injury.

Towards the end of the match, with SMU trying desperately to tie the game, Steven Jair Cabas sealed the upset by passing an SMU defender and the goalkeeper to record the third goal for the Golden Panthers.

The Golden Panthers beat SMU for the first time in 22 years. The victory also marks the first time the Golden Panthers attain a win at the Conference USA Championship Tournament. FIU joined the conference in 2005.

The last ranked opponent FIU defeated was No. 14 Hartwick College in 2004.



FIU 3, Marshall 2 OT



For the second consecutive game, the Golden Panthers (5-13-2) fell behind early against their opponent. Also for the second straight game, the Golden Panthers retaliated to overtake their opponent as they defeated the Marshall Thundering Herd (10-9-1) 3-2 in overtime.

The leading scorer this season thus far, midfielder Juan Guerra, wasted little time to score the game-winning goal in the second minute of overtime.

Throughout the course of the game, the Golden Panther offense created more scoring opportunities leading to 24 shots versus 14 shots for the Thundering Herd.

Marshall would strike first courtesy of a Nick Daniel goal, which got past goalkeeper Kyle Thomas.

Closing out the half, Mario Franco caught to goalkeeper out of position and netted a slow goal to ties the score.

The physical play would increase during the second half as one red card was given to each team. The Thundering Herd's Jermaine Johnson received the first card, and the Golden Panthers' freshman Steven Jair Cabas scored five minutes folling Johnson's ejection.

A penalty kick by the Thundering Herd's Avneet Shergill knotted up the score in the 72nd minute of play. Just one minute later defender Phill Fisher, received a red card to make it a 10-on-10 contest.

Guerra came close to putting the Golden Panthers ahead in the 78th minute, but the shot bounced off the post. 

Both defenses held the offenses in check for the remainder of regulation. 

In the second minute of overtime, Guerra would not hit the post but rather hit the net lifting the Golden Panthers to another win and to the C-USA Conference Finals.

Headline: Water polo team finishes sixth in championship
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As the season came to a close, the men's water polo team left for the National Championships in Townsend, Ariz., on Nov. 9-11. Coming in sixth place this season, this is the fourth consecutive year that the team makes it to nationals. 

This season the team was only defeated once until they reached the national championship. 

The Golden Panthers beat schools such as Florida, Florida State, Pennsylvania, Central Florida and Miami.  

At nationals, they played Minnesota, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Grand Valley State. 

The team defeated Minnesota by one point and UPenn by three points, but lost to Arizona by two points and Grand Valley State by one point. 

Water polo consists of six players playing in a 30-meter pool. All players alternate as both offense and defense. Players are only allowed to use one hand to catch and touch the ball except for the goalie who is allowed to use both hands. 

There are three injection fouls throughout the game until the player is revoked from the competition.  

Other fouls are basic and consist of a 20-second exclusion from the game.

Although the team came in sixth place, freshman 2-meter guard J.D. Garcia is looking forward to next season.

 "We are going to go in next year and start from scratch and build upon our skills," he said.

Team coach Carroll Vaughn has high expectations for the team because of the team's ability to move quickly and use it to its advantage. 

The team strategy is to always keep themselves focused and relaxed, concentrating on the game plan but keeping in mind to have fun and play a good defense.

"Water polo is a sport that if you make a mistake it can cost you a lot," Garcia said.

In order to play for the men's water polo team, students interested must be enrolled as a full-time student and be able to attend practice on Mondays and Wednesdays.

The team was started four years ago through the Student Organization Council. What was then a team of nine players has grown into a team of 15 players. Current captain Alex Martinez remembers the first two years as being the hardest.

"We had just enough players to play in the game, leaving us with only two substitutes," he said.  

Because they are an athletic team, the group now reports to the recreation department. Despite getting some funding from SOC, players are responsible for covering their own traveling expenses, equipment and fee's such as the Collegiate Water Polo Association league fee that they must pay in order to compete at a national level.

"It didn't look like we were going to be able to go to nationals because it's hard to buy a plane ticket when it cost $500 [per person]," Martinez said commenting on how difficult it is to go to away games when they don't have enough funding.

The team's advisor, Thatine "Chini" Camargo, was a former water polo player when she younger. In the summer, she was approached by one of the players on the team and was asked if she was interested to become their advisor. 

"I really admire the sport and thought it would be a good way to support FIU," Camargo said. 

Camargo's goal is to get the team more exposure on campus by getting Panther Rage to attend and support a few home games, help the team to cover travel expenses and getting the team its own website where students can show their support towards the team.

Vaughn also pla0ns on helping them fund raise by having the team do a calendar where companies can sponsor the players and have their photograph taken at their business. 

Her goal is to begin looking into any FIU Alumni who might be interested. 

The team is optimistic to be one of the best teams in the nation but to also get FIU support and recognition for being such a strong national team.  The team looks forward to being financially stable so it can focus on playing and worry less about funding.

Headline: United Students Against Sweatshops: Lecture discusses plight of Florida farm workers
Author: Melissa Beneche / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In protest of the Burger King and other fast food corporations, The Coalition of Immokalee Workers, the United Students Against Sweatshops and the Student-Farmworker Alliance  hosted a lecture Nov. 20. 

	The overall goal of the lecture was to inform about the sweatshop like conditions tomato-picker farm workers in Immokalee, Florida endure as well as other abuses practiced in the agriculture industry. 

	"Companies like McDonald's and Yum Brands have already agreed to work with us in improving wages and working conditions," said Nancy Trevino, a member of the USAS. 

	McDonald's and Yum Brands have agreed to improve farm labor conditions by paying one cent extra for every pound of tomatoes and have also sign a code of conduct. Under the code if either corporation receives a report of abuse about any tomato supplier, they will stop purchases from the supplier.  

	According to the CIW, the average farm worker is paid 40 to 45 cents per bucket filled with produce. When filled with tomatoes, buckets can weigh about 30 pounds.

	 In order to receive the minimum wage, $6.67 per hour in a 10-hour workday, farm workers must carry roughly 2.5 tons of tomatoes a day. An average salary ranges from $8,000 to $10,000 a year and the farm workers do not receive benefits such as health insurance and holidays.

	The CIW has also made accusations that some workers are threatened with physical harm  if they do not complete their workload or stop for water. 

	"They are not asking for better jobs," said Mark Rodriguez, a  member of the SFA. "Burger King, for some reason, doesn't want to acknowledge the fact that farm workers are being abused on a daily basis, and their solution does nothing but take away farm workers." 

	The CIW, USAS, and SFA plan to voice their demands on Nov. 30 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. as they host a nine mile march to the Burger King headquarters. 

	But senior Ashley Richards, member of USAS, sees that protest against Burger King is only the beginning of the end to modern slavery. 

	"The lecture was less about bashing Burger King and more about discussing the workers' struggles in the agriculture industry," Richards said. 

	The CIW, a national group of mainly Latino, Haitian, and Mayan farm workers who formed in 1993 to fight against the injustices faced by farm workers. Initially made up of six people, the CIW now has a membership base of roughly  4,000 members.	

	The primary goal of the CIW is to address labor issues in the U.S. and  improve conditions for farm workers. 

	USAS members commented that the Subway corporation could be another protest target.
