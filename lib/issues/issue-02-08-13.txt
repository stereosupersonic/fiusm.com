Headline: Haritan, defensive player of year, becomes FIU safety
Author: Pete Pelegrin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sometimes you have to take one step back before you can take two steps forward.

Meet John Haritan.  A high school linebacker trapped inside an FIU strong safety's body.  

Haritan was all-everything at Longwood Lyman High in Casselberry, Fla. 

He was named the Orlando Sentinel's Seminole County Defensive Player of the Year. He also collected honors in the following categories: all-conference, all-county, Florida Athletic Coaches' Association all-district, All-Central Florida and honorable mention all-state.

Yet, when Haritan lines up this season for FIU, because of his size, it 
won't be as a linebacker, but rather as a strong safety, but that won't stop him from playing like a linebacker .

"I like to hit and I'll always have that linebacker mentality wherever I play," Haritan, who led the team with five tackles in the final spring game, said.  "It's been a little difficult at first, learning a new position, but when it's done I want to be the best safety in college football."

Despite the intricacies of the safety position, which along with middle linebacker could be equated as the quarterback of the defense, Haritan has learned to use his natural talents to adjust to his new position.

"I think my speed and lack of fear have helped in making the transition," Haritan said. 

"But I still need to fine tune my coverages.  Covering the pass is the toughest adjustment."

It's Haritan's aggressiveness and fearlessness that has also caused some trouble in the position switch.

"It's been a little difficult, because I'm too aggressive," Haritan, who also led the team in tackles last fall with 34 (20 solo), said.  "I've jumped at the run too quickly, that's the linebacker in me coming out."

Haritan is has the same type of fiery attitude.   

The linebacker mentality, aggressiveness and speed are what made Haritan stand out for head coach Don Strock.

"He was a tremendous athlete in high school who was a big hitter," Strock said.  "He's got good speed in the 4.5 range and good size for a safety (6'0, 195-200 lbs), plus he's put on 15 pounds of muscle."

The Golden Panthers have also taken notice of Haritan's size and speed.
"He's got the agility of a wide receiver," wide receiver Everett Mitchell said.  

"It's his instincts for the ball that help him out a lot.  There are not too many times you beat him to the ball."

At Lyman there weren't too many times anyone else beat Haritan either.

Besides football, Haritan also competed in wrestling, weightlifting and track. 

He finished undefeated as a senior heavyweight wrestler, finished his wrestling career with a 39-1 record and was voted Most Outstanding Heavyweight Wrestler in four tournaments.

But he has always loved football.

Haritan grew up rooting for the Dallas Cowboys and has always had football in his blood.

With the Lyman Greyhounds, he was as quick as a greyhound on the field, amassing 327 tackles his last two years and over 400 in his three-year high school career.

With numbers like that he drew attention from Big 12 power Colorado and Florida Atlantic, but chose FIU instead.

"FIU is all new, it's a great opportunity to set records, it's great," Haritan said.  

"The campus is beautiful, the people are friendly and I think they're excited about the upcoming season."

Haritan describes himself as a relaxing, get-away-from-it-all type of guy.  

To relax, he spends time playing Ultimate Fighting Championships on his PlayStation 2 and enjoys watching James Bond films and "anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger."

Ironically, it was Bond and Schwarzenegger, along with some of his friends' dads, who helped Haritan choose the career he would choose to master at FIU.

"I have always liked all the spy movies and the FBI is something I've been interested in my whole life," Haritan, a criminal justice major, said. 

"My friends' dads were with the DEA and they were good role models for me."

Haritan hopes to be a good role model for the first year defense.

"This first season is going to be a good learning experience," Haritan said.  "I hope to look back on something positive to make me a better person."

The coaching staff is looking for players to stand up and lead the novice program. Haritan believes he is what the coaches need. 

"I want to be a team leader who leads the team in tackles," Haritan added. 

"We're all working hard looking to prove ourselves.  We have to step up to the plate."

The Golden Panthers will begin their season on August 29th.

Headline: "Signs" point to box-office success
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Every once and a while, a movie comes around that reminds you of the sheer power films have to move us and toy with our emotions to the extent that we allow ourselves to become immersed in their reality. M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" is, hands down, this kind of picture. Without the tons of special effects, explosions and in-your-face production of other alien films like "Independence Day," "Signs" manages to terrify and disturb even the most skeptical with the basics – lighting, sounds, shadows and one very important element too often neglected: good acting.  

In the film, it's the little things that heighten your fear and paranoia. The rustling in the corn fields as someone or something runs by; imperceptible static that may or may not be hushed whispers of an alien tongue; a dog howling at the moon or something more sinister; or simply the quiet and the dark. Not Hollywood "darkness," but real, pitch-black darkness that reminds us of our vulnerability.  

M. Night Shyamalan gives us these simple but effective elements, as definite signs of what's to come, playing on the fact that often the most cynical will want to believe in signs, in something that makes us believe we have some knowledge of the unknown. As a filmmaker, he knows we will take these signs and let our fears run away with them, taking them to new levels of paranoia all by ourselves. Thus, Shyamalan merely guides us, showing us everything and nothing all at once, making us doubt what we see, but want to believe.

Besides Shyamalan, the actors bring their characters to life through effective and sincere performances. Mel Gibson plays the lead role of Graham Hess, a former pastor consumed with his new disbelief in not only signs, but in his God as well. Hess is determined to live a simple life with his two children Morgan and Bo, played expertly by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, a budding scene-stealer, as well as his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), an ex-minor league ballplayer.  

As the film opens, we learn that although the family seems to live a quiet, quaint little life, they've been devastated by a disastrous event and are attempting to pick up the pieces. Soon, however, outside forces begin to prey on their vulnerability and disturb the uneasy quiet of the Hess family universe in a remote Pennsylvania cornfield. The disturbance, thankfully, sets them on a quest for survival that reminds them of their belief in, if anything, each other.  

The story of the Hess family is one of the things that makes "Signs" a great film.  Unlike many other alien movies that deal with the plight of the world at large in the face of cosmological obstacles, "Signs" concerns itself solely with the plight of one family, and in doing so, deals more sincerely with the plight of humanity as a whole than films concerning thousands of people ever could. The film delves into the minds and hearts of these four people so exclusively that we understand fully their fears, their helplessness, yet profound resilience in the face of forces they can't comprehend.  

We recognize these emotions in ourselves, even if we have never witnessed a crop circle appear over night or lived through and alien attack. We simply understand fear of the unknown, love, faith and hope, because we know that beyond alien encounters, there exist other forces we cannot comprehend. We know these things. Shyamalan and the skillful cast need only serve as guides, and as a result "Signs" moves us to feel emotions, which, as the Hess family shows us, are the simplest, yet greatest powers we posses.

Headline: Marine  biology in place by fall
Author: SHEAON REID / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For years, about eight programs have been offered mainly at the Biscayne Bay Campus. This semester the Board of Trustees has approved a new program &#8211; marine biology.

"This is a brand new program implemented mainly because students currently majoring in biology have demonstrated a great interest in marine biology," Marine Biology Program Director Christopher Brown said. 

In previous years, students who had an interest in marine biology were forced to look for other universities that offer the program.

Yearly retreats held on campus have helped FIU in determining the need for a marine biology program. Through surveys conducted at these retreats FIU was able to see the growing interest students had. 

"This is a brand new program implemented mainly because students currently majoring in biology have demonstrated a great interest in marine biology as well," Brown said.  

Assistant Professor Frank Jochem, was surprised a marine biology program was not offered at FIU until now.

"I was surprised the program was not offered here before because the research facilities, such as coral reefs and a gulf stream that is only 10 minutes away by boat, are unique not only to FIU but also to Miami," Jochem said. "Young people who come to Miami to vacation because the climate is pleasant and to engage in different water activities, can also do so as part of their studies at an affordable price."

Brown, who was recruited from Hawaii two years ago to set up the program here at FIU, said two advisors with 10-year contracts and a visiting professor have been hired for the program while an additional two positions will be advertised soon. 

To accommodate the new program, construction of a waterfront marine biology lab is expected to begin by the start of the fall semester and be completed by early 2005. 

The marine biology lab will be constructed just behind the Wolfe University Center and Academic One, close to the bay. 

Implementation of the program and construction of the lab yielded an estimated cost of $12.75 million. President Modesto Maidique approved of the building's design last week. It is not yet known when the plan will be available to the public. 

In order to hire new people, such as a secretary and other faculty and staff, state legislators funded the marine biology program. The founding of this program was a joint effort between the Biology Department and the Office of Research. 

The marine biology courses and activities are designed not only for marine biology majors but also for non-majors. 

Marine biology majors will have to fulfill the same lower division requirements as students going for a BS in biological sciences, including basic science, chemistry, physics and calculus courses. These can be taken at any one of the FIU campuses.

Upper division courses will only be available at the BBC and will include five common requirements such as biochemistry and genetics, and eight marine electives from which students will have to choose four.

Other courses required for the major can be found in the undergraduate catalog located on the FIU website. 

Brown also plans to implement an honors track for the program. 

"Not only am I working to develop this program, but I am also working on developing an honors track which should be set to go in the next semester or two," Brown said. 

Brown, as well as other faculty members, has high hopes for the new program.

"It has always been a popular class, and we can predict that it is going to be successful," Brown said. 

"Marine biology is the perfect science major to add to Arts and Sciences' offerings at Biscayne Bay campus," Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences Joyce Peterson said. "It makes use of our location and our growing science faculty. We are very excited about providing this opportunity for our students."

Non-marine biology students are also excited about the new program. 

"The new program will definitely attract more students to the Biscayne Bay campus," said junior Handy Mussotte. "The program will also be of convenience to students living in Miami who want to major in marine biology but perhaps had to go to other universities to find this major."

"I see the new program being implemented as Biscayne Bay's time to do something," said sophomore Vanessa Clarke. "Do something in terms of progressing, because so far only the University Park campus has been progressing, such as the bookstore and soon to be GC.  So I think the program is proof that we too can progress."

Headline: BBC parking lots treated for sinking
Author: SHEAON REID / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Biscayne Bay Campus' parking lots are going through major renovations this summer.

Earlier in the summer, lots one, two and three were fully repaired and renovated.  Lots five and six are currently under construction. 

"The main reason for the renovation of the first three lots was to prevent flooding," Business and Finance Executive Director Nicholas Diciacco said.

"Parking lots one and two sank a little bit, below the normal drain level," he explained, "this caused water to be deposited in these areas." 

Diciacco said the main reason for the sinking of the parking lots was due to the type of soil found in Florida. The soil is soft and made of muck – a wet organic soil. This type of soil is especially found closer to the shore. As a result, after many years of wear and tear, the parking lots have sunk below the regular drainage level, he added. 

Parking lots five and six are also being renovated because of insufficient drainage. 

"The construction one sees going on right now is to install new drains," Diciacco said. "These parking lots would flood terribly and students would have to walk in knee high water just to get to their cars."

Funding for the renovations and repairs of the parking lots was received primarily from the Department of Parking and Traffic and partly from Diciacco himself.

"Funds came from an auxiliary account from Parking and Traffic," Diciacco said. "Unfortunately, they came up short so I put some money into an infrastructure account for the remainder."

Total funding for the renovation of the parking lots was $355,000, with renovations being done by Horizon Paving. The new parking lots are to be completed by the beginning of the fall semester if there is no interference from the weather. 

Diciacco feels the closing of the parking lots caused little inconvenience. 

"There is some amount of inconvenience," Diciacco said. "But the fact that we are doing it over the summer has reduced the inconvenience to a minimal." 

Students also agree that the closed parking lots didn't cause too much trouble for them. 

"I have not experienced any major inconvenience from the closing of the parking lots," finance major Krishna Jones said. "But I am glad they are renovating the parking lots because even after the rain stops there is still a lot of water in the parking lots and it doesn't help much when you are trying to get to your car."

Other students also reacted positively towards the renovations. 

"I am glad something is finally being done about the parking lots," junior Alexander Reyes said. "The parking lots would flood terribly and I would have difficulty getting to my car."

Why hadn't the renovations taken place before if the problem with flooding has been going on for a while? 

Diciacco said he has been trying for at least the past five years to get the parking lot situation cleared up, but the funds for the projects took quite some time to attain. 

"First, $355,000 is a lot of money," Diciacco said. "In addition, there were other needs and other expenses that needed immediate attention at the time."

Headline: FIU Judo club overcomes carjacking attempt 
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU judo club members fended off a carjacking attempt in Los Angeles, Calif. on Sunday afternoon, before turning the offender over to the LAPD.

The co-ed team, which was in Los Angeles to teach a self-defense seminar, pulled its rented van into a Hollywood gas station at approximately 2:00 p.m. when they were approached by Tyrone Jermaine Hogan. 

Hogan, 20, was beaten by the six team members and their instructor.

The suspect approached the vehicle and asked if the instructor, Nestor Bustillo, would be willing to pay him a dollar if he pumped the gas for them.

After the instructor, Nestor Bustillo, refused, Hogan became belligerent and threatening.

Bustillo choked Hogan in an attempt to subdue him, but Hogan became nervous and fled to his car. Fearing that Hogan had a gun in the vehicle, Bustillo ran to the car, grabbed the keys from the ignition and threw them out.

"We thought he was going to get a knife or gun," senior Cristina Baldacci told The Beacon. "It was like a cartoon with everyone screaming."

A weapon was not found on Hogan after police arrived.

Hogan then approached the team's mini-van and tried to grab the keys from the ignition.

At that point, a scuffle broke out. As some of the team members dove to try to grab the keys, Luis Rizo pulled Hogan out of the car while Bustillo and his son, Adam, turned him over onto his stomach and held his arms behind his back.

"We had this guy like a pretzel on the ground," Nestor Bustillo said.

Baldacci then informed Hogan of his mistake.

Baldacci recalls saying, "What the f*** were you thinking? This guy is (Nestor Bustillo). He is a black belt. You messed with the FIU judo team," as she used her foot to hold the assailant's face to the ground and he became further agitated.

During the altercation, the nozzle of a gasoline pump broke out, causing its contents to douse the team members and Hogan.

"We were wrestling around, there was gas pumping out and we were trying to subdue this guy," Nestor Bustillo said.

"It looked like a scene out of a movie with the gasoline pouring out," he later added.

Hogan held his ribs and showed signs that he was in pain when he was arrested.

"The boys are punching him in the face and I wanted to go around for a choke, to choke him out, but I didn't want to risk getting punched in the head, so I started pounding him from the back," said Baldacci.

"It's impressive that none of us punched each other."

"They hit him a couple of times and brought him to ground," LAPD Officer Jack Richter said. "Our department does not condone or recommend that people do that in a carjacking because you never know if the carjacker is armed."

The carjacking attempt wasn't the first for Hogan.

A half-hour earlier, about six miles away, he allegedly carjacked a couple, punching the driver in the face before pulling him out of the Nissan and driving away with his wife in the passenger seat, Police Sgt. Karlene Gibson said. Hogan also tried to steal the woman's purse, before pushing her out of the car.

Hogan was apparently trying to ditch the Nissan and find a new mode of transportation.

The judo team was on its way to Los Angeles International airport after taking a tour of Hollywood. After the altercation, some members of the team showered at the Hollywood police station and then flew back to Miami.

The club consists of Baldacci, Adam Bustillo, Viviana Bustillo, Raul Cruz, Luis Rizo and Katheryn Vasquez.

Hogan is being held on a $1.2 million bail.

Headline: Gay Adoption article makes illogical assertions
Author: Paul Bishop
&nbsp;
To the editor:

A guest columnist recently graced The Beacon with his opinions on gay adoption.  As grateful as I am for his time and effort, I feel compelled to comment on the logical absurdity and inhumanity of his message.  Even neglecting all of his poor reason and hostility, one is left feeling insulted by the fact that absolutely no evidence was provided to support any of the author's assertions, save some disputable and and statistically questionable data with absolutely no connection to any point he was making whatsoever.  

He begins by suggesting that religion is a valid basis for legislation.  The concept of the separation of church and state is sufficient to deflate that astoundingly foolish assertion.  The founders of the United States wished to govern with reason.  Clearly, we cannot consider any religion in making law if we are to uphold the Constitution of the United States.

Even if we do not accept the wishes of our nation's founders as sufficient reason to ignore any and all religious doctrine in forming law, we must ask ourselves if this is a good idea on its own.  I assert that religion cannot be relevant to law on the grounds that religion can be as dysfunctional as it can be functional in a society.  

Both murderers and healers cite the Bible as being precious and instructive to them.  Must we respect both the murderer's and healer's interpretations as a matter of law?  If not, how can we prove one of these interpretations to be more correct than the other?  

Considering this, it seems that it can't matter what Christianity says about law or morality, and we probably shouldn't care what any other religions say about law or morality either.  While I could support this assertion in more depth, I must leave this matter as it stands in order to discuss other matters.  Regardless, I challenge the author of the article I am discussing to prove that I am wrong.

The assertion that there is scientific evidence to prove the unwholesomeness of homosexual lifestyles is perhaps the most perplexing statement in Mr. Ball's article.  If this is the case, I wish to see the published studies that inspired our author's conclusion.  More importantly, I wonder how one could scientifically measure "wholesomeness"?  My belief is that science has nothing to say about wholesome lifestyles, as it only concerns itself with objective data about the physical world which we inhabit.  

  Science cannot say anything about morality or wholesomeness, since these are also things that cannot be measured or reproduced in a laboratory.  Clearly, science has no place in this discussion, and the author was merely using the word "science" to impress his readership.  I see a trend in this.

Leaving the absurdity of "scientific wholesomeness," we still have to contend with the assertion that homosexuality is inherently unwholesome.  This is also an absurd assertion, as there is no evidence cited by the author to prove that the provided "sad and sobering" statistics have anything to do with homosexuality itself as opposed to the systematic and overt oppression gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals still face in the United States.  

I would hasten to add that the author cites statistics and facts based entirely on small populations within the United States.  It might surprise the author to know that several European nations &#8211; chief among them being The Netherlands &#8211; have different populations of homosexuals for whom the prospects of American homosexuals are horrifyingly bleak by comparison.  The reason for this is that  gay lesbian and transsexual individuals have more social support in these aforementioned European nations, including the legal right to adopt.  

Considering international statistics, it is interesting to note what is going on in Africa.  African culture is traditionally extremely homophobic.  Heterosexuality is the sole accepted form of sexuality in most modern African societies.  

It seems that heterosexual people on that continent have managed to create extremely unwholesome households despite the complete repression of homosexuality, if AIDS indicates unwholesomeness as Mr. Ball seems to suggest.  In several large African cities, 50 percent of the local population is infected with AIDS.  Even accepting that some of the propagation of this disease is due to homosexual activity, the sheer vastness of these numbers speaks volumes about how little the AIDS epidemic has to do with sexual orientation.  

I am gay myself.  I resent the assertion that I must be promiscuous because of my sexual preference.  I am quite the opposite.  In fact, have never had sex outside of a long term relationship.  I doubt that most heterosexuals can make that claim.  The vilifying of an entire class of people based on the behavior of a few reckless and unfortunate individuals is both a logical fallacy &#8211; meaning an old, dirty trick used by people who cannot win their arguments logically &#8211; and against the wording and spirit of the Constitution of the United States.  The Constitution of the United States does not uphold Mr. Ball's claims &#8211; it actually refutes them.

We are left with nothing more than bold, unproven, and logically absurd assertions in Mr. Randy Ball's article when we examine the facts of the matter.  It is much easier to make bold statements and suggest that they can be proven correct than to actually explain one's ideas coherently and prove them to be true in the process.  

My challenge to Mr. Ball is to prove any of his points.  If I could be so bold as to make a helpful suggestion, it would be that the process would be much easier if he were first explain what his points are in an intelligible manner.  I would like to offer my assistance should the author determine that he cannot complete the task alone.  

I do not ask for any payment.  As things are, I am honestly guessing what he intends to communicate in much of his article.  This annoys me.  My peace of mind in finally knowing what it was he was trying to say would be payment enough.

Headline: "Get Ready" program gains deserved recognition
Author: Bill Adams/PRSSA Faculty Advisor
&nbsp;
To the editor:  

As faculty advisor to FIU's Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) Chapter, I'd like to (belatedly) thank The Beacon for the excellent page one coverage of the students' 2002 "Get Ready" hurricane guide program, July 16.  

Our students work many months to produce and distribute the guides, with input from the National and International Hurricane Centers, both local Red Cross Chapters and various Emergency Management offices, so that information is timely and valuable to South Florida residents.  Over the past nine years, the "Get Ready" program has won two national awards as the country's top university community service project.

This year, thanks again to the generosity of the BP Corp and the International Hurricane Center, students produced and distributed some 80,000 guides in English and Spanish for South Floridians through participating BP/Amoco stations and donated thousands of guides to the local Red Cross chapters and other nonprofit organizations.

Permit me, however, to correct a misunderstanding about "applying for funding" that made it into your page one story and then into the editorial, "PRSSA should do more to avoid any future funding mishaps" (July 16).  

Actually, the reason there was no 2001 "Get Ready" hard copy editions is that from 2000-2001 BP Corp. was in the process of buying and then merging with Amoco Corp. and funding for the project simply disappeared from the corporate radar screen for 2001. 

It had nothing to do with a late application.  But, thanks to a BP executive in the corporation's Atlanta regional office, funding was found for the 2002 edition and PRSSA was once again able to produce these free 72-page booklets for South Floridians.

Thanks again for the coverage and we'll keep The Beacon posted on plans for the 2003 (10th anniversary) editions.

Headline: In Our View: Restoration of parking lots worth inconvenience
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Considering FIU's large population of commuter students, one of the most vital aspects of student life are effective and spacious parking lots. 

This summer, the university set out to repair certain parking lots at the BBC campus that sank slightly below the normal level.

There is no doubt that the temporary loss of the parking spots located in lots one and two at BBC were a slight inconvenience to students.

In the long-run, however, had the university waited to repair the lots, the situation could have worsened and perhaps become an even greater inconvenience to students and faculty alike.  

Thankfully, FIU chose to repair the lots over the summer, a time when the student population decreases, thus reducing the need for the temporarily unavailable lots and decreasing the convenience to students.

In fact, the university dealt with the matter in the most effective way possible to the extent that most students didn't even consider the unavailable lots an inconvenience. 

These kinds of things are, of course, inevitable, for the most part.  And chances are, that the majority of students understand these repairs have to be made and will live with the inconvenience, if any.

However, it's when problems like these get ignored, like the recent UP broken call box situation (the broken boxes were ignored for over a year),  that they start to represent a more serious problem and inconvenience.

Thankfully, this time around the university acted in a timely manner and repaired the lots at a good time, which was definitely the wisest course of action.

Headline: Former Beacon columnist remembered
Author: Christopher Doell
&nbsp;
I've often thought of whom I'd ask to be my best man at my wedding.  There's my childhood friend Eric, there are the guys from Rutgers, and then there's Patrick.  Patrick would have been the one.  

Not only was I closest to him at this point in my life, but he would have been so good at it.  He would have thrown me one hell of a bachelor party; he would have enjoyed helping in arrangements, and he would have delivered the most thoughtful speech at my reception.  He was a stand-up guy.

Patrick introduced himself to me in Philosophical Analysis, sophomore year.  I had reached a point where I had become convinced that I had nothing in common with anyone at FIU &#8211; Patrick changed that.

I now reflect on the evolution of our relationship.  It began as most friendships do, but I believe it grew beyond what most others achieve.  We developed a friendship that meant more than hanging out and having fun &#8211; we actually cared about one another.  We could share problems and count on sound advice.  For all the talking Patrick did, he sure was good at listening. 

My memories of Patrick are plentiful: the road trips, the study sessions (more like laughing sessions), the workouts, the classes (laughing sessions), changing my flat tires, the Dave Matthews Band concert, the one-on-one tackle football that made us feel like we were 10 years old again, the hand-me-down hairdo, the inside jokes, his exaggerated but hilarious stories, his accents and impressions, the good natured teasing, his incessant dreaming, the music talks, the girl talks, the family talks, the life talks, the nonsense talks, and more and more girl talks &#8211; all of which usually melted into laughter and enjoyment.

I would always call Patrick an impractical dreamer.  Out of the blue he'd say things like, "Let's become private investigators."  

He'd talk about writing a movie script with me, envisioning us as the next Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.  

We were once fooling with my guitar and he said we should start a band &#8211; becoming huge rock stars was the next logical step for Patrick.  In a speculative conversation regarding the "secret" CEO gathering in Northern California and he said, "We should pick up some preppy clothes and show up," implying we'd just be able to walk in and mingle.  

People don't normally say things like "I'm going to be President of the United States," but Patrick did.  

Patrick's talk was entertaining, but it also helped me loosen the grips of my practical thinking and made me a bit dreamier.  I would love to thank him for that.

Patrick's father asked me if in any of my philosophy courses I found any answers &#8211; or only more questions &#8211; regarding death.  I told him certainly the latter.  By its very nature death is an unknowable, and thus troubling, phenomenon.  Patrick's death seems unfair, but I'm of the opinion that there's no one to blame, no one to praise &#8211; it was just a circumstantial occurrence.  It's a sad thing.  

I'm sad not only for my and everyone's loss, but for Patrick himself.  He had a nice life ahead of him and he would have continued fulfilling his potential.

I don't know what kind of friends he and I would have become down the road.  I suppose we could have simply drifted off into each other's memories after we left for graduate and law school, or we could have continued to grow, support, and enjoy each other.  Considering our past, I'm sure the latter would have been the likely situation.

The Beacon would like to send its condolences to the family and friends of Patrick Guerra. Patrick was a devoted student and skillful columnist who will always be remembered for his enthusiasm, talents and positive attitude.  He will be greatly missed.

A news bulletin timidly edged into this concentration pattern, which was focused on the fourth race at Louisiana Downs. A faint voice from the periphery told about some college hacking into another college's Web site, thereby learning some deep, dark secrets.

As it turned out, the story was a bit more serious than a prank. The Yales complained to the FBI that the Princetons were swiping valuable information regarding prospective students. The details, of course, were in Greek, as are all computer explanations. Something about unauthorized log-ins by the Princeton admissions office. Not exactly your garden-variety campus caper.

What the story did, however, was bring back lore of campus mischief from the days when laughter ruled instead of gas mask research. Here on the frontier, campus mischief was more basic. Our capers were more like kidnapping the other school's mascot before the upcoming football game. Like making off with the Baylor bear or the Aggie collie.

There is the parable about how the Texas steer mascot got its name back in 1916. The first longhorn was an ornery orange-and-white steer, and Texas students planned a ceremonial branding, 27-7, the winning score of the last Texas A&M game. Aggie students slipped into the steer's pen the night before and branded 13-0, their last winning score, on the animal's side. With some ingenuity, Texas students subsequently altered the brand to read B-E-V-O, the name of a popular beer of the times.

There was a yarn, too, about Arlington State when it was a junior college and its main rival was John Tarleton in Stephenville. Arlington students prepared a big bonfire to be ignited the night before their traditional game. A Tarleton student rented an old biplane, with the aim of flying low over the woodpile and igniting it by dropping some sort of gasoline bombs. But a strong-arm Arlington student, seeing the plane approaching at roof height, grabbed a stick and flung it into the propeller, downing the raider. Such were campus pranks on the old frontier.

At Cal Tech, however, a bit more brainpower was employed (it doesn't take a high IQ to throw a stick). The Southern Cal card section at football games is an involved masterpiece of engineering and planning. Scientifically programmed cards are passed down rows in numerical order. On certain signals, each student holds up his colored card, and magically, a huge "USC TROJANS" against a garish background appears on this sea of students. It is something to see.

But these pesky Cal Techs, future scientists and engineers and whatever, broke into the USC storeroom, changed the instructions on the back of each card and reprogrammed the whole smear. The next day, before a packed coliseum and a national TV audience, the USC producer barked a number into his microphone, the cards flashed, and to the great Trojan embarrassment, they spelled out "CAL TECH."

Finally, another campus masterpiece is credited to Cal Tech students (or maybe it was MIT smarties) whose favorite professor bought one of the first Volkswagens to arrive on these shores. He was immensely proud of his vehicle, constantly lecturing about its superior engineering.

One weekend, he flew out of town for a meeting. His students picked the garage lock, painstakingly dismantled the Volkswagen down to its smallest nut and bolt and then painstakingly reassembled the car to the last detail, in perfect running order, in the professor's upstairs bedroom.

Headline: Bright Futures column neglects crucial facts
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Two weeks ago, Beacon columnist Jason Andreasen wrote on Florida's Bright Futures Scholarship blasting the state for cutting the program's funding which left thousands of Florida public, and some of the eligible private school, students unable to take summer classes.

While I agree the state should do everything possible to increase the amount of money it spends on education, I disagree with some of the facts Andreasen cites in his column.

It's no surprise the nation's economy took a turn for the worse following the Sept. 11 attacks. Florida's economy followed suit. 

As a result the state's income, which is based on a six-percent sales tax, was adversely affected to the tune of $1 billion. In an attempt to cope with the situation, Gov. Jeb Bush asked the legislature to cut the state's budget. Everyone took a hit.

Simply saying the state chose not to fund the Bright Futures Scholarship Program for the summer term is an outright lie: Tallahassee had to cut from its budget and did so at the expense of an experiment. That's right, an experiment. The previous 2000-2001 academic year was the first in which the program was provided with enough state funds to help pay for students to attend classes in the summer.

It comes as a shock that Andreasen was not made aware of the situation. It's even more of a shock to see his mistake make it to print – fact is, the university sent Florida Bright Futures recipients an e-mail stating the scholarship would not be offered during the summer back in the spring semester.

Checking the university's Student Information System web site (sis.fiu.edu) would have yielded the same result. Searching the Financial Aid Page for my own 2000-2001 records, I am clearly shown the Bright Futures award for the summer is $0.00.

It's hard to believe Andreasen found out after he started taking classes during the Summer A semester.

While we're on the subject of summer semesters, let's point out another blunder. 

Andreasen wrote that students "must attend a summer term" to graduate from a state institution. Let's not mislead our readers, Jason. Students must take nine summer credits to graduate.

Andreasen also takes shots at Gov. Bush for introducing "policy after policy that have all done one of two things: either directly hurt our educational system or deprived them of truckloads of money."

While I disagree with the governor's mandate to disband the Board of Regents and install local boards of trustees, I don't see how this has directly hurt our educational system.

I also disagree with the governor's preference for school vouchers. Maybe that's what Andreasen labels as having deprived schools from "truckloads of money."  Still, I don't see how that's possible.

Students should ignore your recommendation, based on your so-called facts, to vote for a candidate other than Bush in the gubernatorial elections. In case it hasn't sunk in yet, the governor is not responsible for the budget cuts. To quote the 1992 Clinton/Gore campaign slogan: "It's the economy, stupid!"

While Andreasen should be commended for his "outside" research – he takes time to point out over and over how Florida ranks 49th in the nation in per-student-spending, 49th in high school graduations and 46th in SAT scores, he should be more careful about researching all the facts, not just looking for statistics to help make his argument look more credible.

Bottom line, making accusations like these are reckless.

Headline: Common SENS: Looking at the 2002 NFL season 
Subheadline: Fifteen questions about the upcoming season.
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Fifteen questions about the upcoming NFL season.

1. How 'bout them Cowboys?

Not doing very well. An aging Emmitt Smith and an offensive line that should force him to take a beating aren't close to being Dallas' worst problem. Quincy Carter is slated to start at quarterback for the Cowboys, who will have to struggle through this season while waiting for a good crop of draft picks to mature. Despite what Jerry Jones says publicly, the team's confidence in Carter seems so low that they spent $4.1 million in guaranteed money on Chad Hutchinson, who hasn't played football since 1997, and he has a good chance at pushing Carter for the starting job.

2. How will Steve Spurrier fair in Washington?

Giving Marvin Lewis control over the defense will be a good start, but Spurrier is kidding himself if he truly believes that Shane Matthews, Danny Wuerfful , or Sage Rosenthal can pass the Redskins into the playoffs. 

3. Can Chicago equal last season's surprising 13-3 season?

Barring a couple more Mike Brown overtime miracles, the answer is no. 

They'll be good, but not 13-3 good. Non-division games against Philadelphia, New England, St. Louis, Miami, the Jets and Tampa Bay will present the Bears with a significantly greater challenge than last season.

Look for a quarterback controversy if Jim Miller struggles early, with Chris Chandler waiting behind him.

4. Will the Vikings rebound after last year's implosion?

They can't be much worse. Mike Tice should bring some discipline that wasn't there under Dennis Green, but this team still has problems. It will be difficult for Minnesota to finish better than third in the NFC North, with the Packers and Bears in the division.

5. Can Michael Vick and a running back change make a difference in Atlanta?

Vick has great talent, but has had some problems learning an NFL offense. Still, he undeniably has great play-making ability and scares opponents more than Chris Chandler ever did. The NFC South is one of the most uncertain divisions in the league with Atlanta, Carolina, New Orleans and Tampa Bay. The running back issue remains a question for the Falcons after letting go of Jamal Anderson. Warrick Dunn and rookie T.J. Duckett will compete to be the featured back.

6. Is Tampa Bay still an almost?

The question mark is still the same as it has been for the past half-decade. Can this team score? 

Jon Gruden will try to bring his offense east. 

Rich Gannon wasn't known as a good quarterback pre-Gruden, but Gannon has a much better work ethic and knowledge than either Brad or Rob Johnson. 

Still, Keyshawn Johnson will love working with Gruden.

7. Will Drew Bledsoe be the Bills' answer at quarterback?

Bledsoe is obviously a significant upgrade over Alex Van Pelt and Travis Brown. He will have plenty of quality targets with Eric Moulds, Peerless Price and Jay Riemersma. The offensive line was fixed in a big way, with 6-6, 375 pound first round pick Mike Williams. The question is the young, young, defense, which will cost Buffalo games.

8. Is New England still super?

This is still the same team that won the Super Bowl last year. But they won on heart, defense and playing mistake-free football and that is too hard to duplicate for an entire second season. The questions are the same as last season. Are Tom Brady and Antwain Smith half-year wonders?

9. Who will carry the ball for Denver?

This is the question that every fantasy owner wants answered. It seems that any running back that is inserted into this offense gains yardage behind a very good offensive line. Terrell Davis is expected to start, but with his history of injuries, Mike Anderson will get plenty of carries. With Shannon Sharpe returning to Denver at tight end, his blocking will help the Broncos continue to pile up yards on the ground.

10. Is Vinny Testaverde's job in jeopardy?

The hints are definitely pointing in that direction.  The 14-year veteran is 32-16 as the Jets starter, but struggled to find his way in offensive coordinator Paul Hackett's offense last season, surpassing 200 yards four times.
 
11. How will the Ohio teams fair?

How is it possible for the Bengals to go this long without even stumbling over a half-decent quarterback? After failed attempts to acquire Drew Bledsoe and Elvis Grbac, Cincinnati will again have to settle for the services of Jon Kitna. Peter Warrick should only get better, but how will they get him the ball? Have to feel bad for Corey Dillon. 

State rival Cleveland is fairing much better. In year number three, 

Tim Couch will have to prove that he is worth the time and money that Cleveland has afforded him. 

William Green could turn into a very good NFL running back and the defense looks solid with Kenard Lang, Gerard Warren and Courtney Brown. Butch Davis was always good with young talent.

12. What will life in Oakland be like without Jon Gruden?

Rich Gannon had a great relationship with Gruden, but the system won't be much different this season. Al Davis continued his tradition of hiring from within the organization, promoting offensive coordinator Bill Callahan to head coach. Gannon still has Hall of Fame duo Tim Brown and Jerry Rice to throw to and Charlie Garner is a great fit in the Raiders' system. 

13. Are the Texans ready to compete?

Houston took advantage of other teams' salary cap problems in the expansion draft. Tony Boselli, Seth Payne, Gary Walker, Jamie Sharper, Kailee Wong, Aaron Glenn, and Marcus Coleman aren't exactly your normal expansion players. David Carr is the type of patient, life-experienced rookie that is needed on an expansion team. Houston will still finish last in the AFC South, though and will go through the normal growing pains.

14. Has Tony Dungy improved the Colts' defense enough?

As of this point, no. The Indianapolis offense is still the best in the AFC, but Dungy hasn't been able to bring in many defensive difference makers. Besides cornerback Walt Harris, not much has changed. Chad Bratzke and Mike Peterson are good players who help, but combined with Harris, that still leaves eight other players on that side of the ball. 

The defense will have to overachieve to help Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin Harrison take this team deep into the playoffs, but it might be enough to help this team take the AFC South – which includes last season's underachieving Jacksonville and Tennessee and the expansion Texans.

As far as the immediate future – no one could have asked for a better position than the Pittsburgh Steelers. Cleveland will be the Steelers' biggest challenger in a division that includes Cincinnati and Baltimore.

15. How about the hometown Dolphins?

Miami is as good as any other team in the AFC East and Dave Wannstedt has gotten this team to overachieve in his first two seasons. The Ricky Williams addition doesn't even need to be discussed – it will help. 

There are questions along both lines, though. Injury problems led to the Dolphins struggling to open holes for Lamar Smith last season and even Williams needs room to run. 

The release of Daryl Gardener leaves concerns along the defensive line. Left end will be run by-committee with Rob Burnett, Jay Williams and possibly others sharing time. 

This team should win its division and whether the questions are answered will determine how far this team goes.

Headline: Football prepares for opener
Subheadline: Tickets now available
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the start of football season just days away, the Student Government Association, Student Organizations Council and Programming Council are preparing to bring school spirit to the forefront like never before. 

"Football is going to bring so many changes to FIU," Student Union Board Chairperson Roxy Fuentes said. "Both the Football Committee and Panther Rage have done so much to begin a new tradition here at FIU.  We are a young University and in 30 years have accomplished so much." 

With the new sport comes new tradition. Student Government's "Welcome Week" will feature a barbecue from noon to 5p.m. before kickoff of the inaugural game against St. Peters College. 

The football players will have a "walk" from the housing complex to the stadium. Student organizations will be able to participate in a decorating contest known as "follow the roar." Banners from this event will be placed around the stadium. Another tradition will be the "petting of the panther." Everyone entering the stadium will have a chance to pet a sculptured panther that has previously been on display in Panther Hall and the Graham Center. 

FIU athletic teams as a whole have never seen this kind of support. The women's basketball team, volleyball team and baseball squad, all competed in postseason play with women's basketball and volleyball winning conference titles. The baseball team made its sixth consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament and was ranked in the top 25. 

But rarely, if ever, did these teams see an attendance surpassing 1,000 spectators. 

"The fact that there is a big marketing campaign is the biggest difference," Fuentes said about the expected attendance at football games. "We're reaching out to the community. We're not just promoting football to the FIU community but to the whole [South Florida] community. We've invested in billboards on the 836, Coca-Cola commemorative cans, Crystal Light trucks are all going to have {an FIU football logo} on them, and we just cut a deal to have commercials in movie theatres." 

This approach is a huge contrast to how other FIU sports are marketed. Previously, no FIU athletic team has seen this level of anticipation.  

According to the findings of  President Maidique's appointed task force,  campus life would be enhanced, alumni loyalty would be built by bringing graduates back to campus, and the sport would increase FIU's visibility in Florida and in the nation. 

So far, the department of campus life has seen a big improvement, in large part because the Student Government Association has stressed it with more events, alumni's make up a large portion of the 3,000 current season ticket holders, and a primetime, state-wide slot on Sunshine Network was secured for the first contest on August 29th. 

"Our main concern is that the fans have a good experience," Fuentes said. "Win or lose, we want people to come and have a good time." 

Free, single game tickets for students  are now available in GC 104. A companion ticket can also be purchased for $5. Purchases online can be done at http://football.fiu.edu/tickets.htm.

Headline: Strock to co-host weekly show on WTVJ 
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU Athletics and WTVJ-TV, NBC 6 in Miami announced the station would begin to broadcast a weekly FIU football highlight show beginning Saturday, Sept. 7.

The show will be co-hosted by Joe Rose, WTVJ's sports anchor and former Miami Dolphins tight end,  and Golden Panthers head coach Don Strock. The half-hour shows will be taped and aired 14 consecutive Saturday mornings from 9:30 to 10 a.m. 

Highlights of the previous week's game, a preview of the upcoming opponent, player interviews and special guests will all be featured.

"FIU is defined by vision, quality and leadership, and it is an important part of our community," NBC 6 President and General Manager Don Browne said in a press release. 

"We are thrilled to join forces with FIU and to be a part of the birth of what is sure to become an outstanding football program. Don Strock is an inspired leader and he has the vision and passion to lead his Golden Panthers to great success."

Students from FIU's School of Journalism and Mass Communications will have the opportunity to produce weekly features showcasing university organizations and events on each broadcast.

"Securing a coach's show on a broadcast station the caliber of WTVJ as a new program is a significant step in the building of FIU football," said FIU Athletics Director Rick Mello. 

"I think this speaks highly of Don Strock's efforts in building this program and his standing in our community and I very much appreciate Don Browne and the people associated with NBC 6 for their confidence in us."

FIU begins its first year of intercollegiate football competition at the NCAA Division I-AA level against Saint Peter's College on Thursday, Aug. 29. at the on-campus Community Stadium.

The contest will be broadcasted statewide on Sunshine Network.

Headline: Strock names Burke starter
Subheadline: Tabor will also receive playing time
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Jamie Burke, a true freshman, will start the Golden Panther football team's inaugural game against St. Peters. Back up David Tabor will also receive playing time.

Head coach Don Strock named Burke the starter over Tabor, on Wednesday, and informed each quarterback in one-on-one meetings.

Unless either Burke or Tabor are injured, FIU will red-shirt Josh Padrick.

"They all worked hard," Strock said. "We're comfortable with David coming off the bench. If something goes hay-wire, I need someone who knows what we're doing."

"Dave will play in the first game. He'll probably play in every game," he added.

Tabor is part of FIU's first-ever recruiting class and Burke officially became a Golden Panther this past February.

The career-NFL back up places a large importance on the No. 2 position.

"For me, I'm a career back-up, so I know what I want in the second guy, coming off the sideline," Strock said.

Burke threw for over 2,800 yards as a senior at Cardinal Mooney and led all prep quarterbacks in the state with 34 touchdown passes. At last Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage, he rallied the Golden Panthers offense with two touchdown drives, while completing 6-of-9 attempts for 89 yards. 

After choosing FIU over the University of Florida, Burke set his sights on the starting job.

"I came here and I wanted to start," Burke said. "I thought I had a good chance to start. I came in here with a lot of hard work. I went over the play book every night."

Tabor refuses to dwell on the decision and will focus on the task ahead of him.

"I feel pretty good about the whole situation. Obviously, there is a little heartache," Tabor said. "There are no hard feelings. It's a difficult situation."

Padrick ran the option at Merritt Island High School and must adjust to Strock's wide-open, one running back offense.

Headline: Football takes practice field
Subheadline: Team begins preparation for inaugural game
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU Football opened practice Monday afternoon and the players needed no reminder that the program's inaugural game is 16 days away.

"I've got a little calendar in my room and I'm marking the days off," said quarterback David Tabor.

Tabor and his teammates went through the team's first two-a-day practice, working for almost two hours in the sweltering afternoon heat before adding about an hour and a half of work at night. 

The team went through position drills, seven-on-seven situations and 66 offensive plays with helmets, shorts and shoulder pads. 

For many of the Golden Panthers who spent the last year preparing for the team's Aug. 29, opening game against St. Peter's College, the start of practice was a welcome sign that the beginning is near.

"I was real anxious before it started," defensive back Nick Turnbull said. "It's FIU's first two-a-days. The practice year was a real long year –not having anything to look forward too."

Turnbull made most of the highlight plays in the afternoon practice, making two one-handed interceptions during the drills.

"I just tried to knock them down and made the play," Turnbull said.

Those interceptions were a part of the overall defensive play, which appeared to be ahead of the offense.

The offense opened the practice with an 0 for 9 passing drought, but improved as the day wore on. Late in the afternoon, quarterback Jamie Burke hit running back Jerrid Lundstedt down the sideline for 35 yards.

"It was a good effort, but we made a lot of mistakes," head coach Don Strock said. "I think the two young quaraterbacks (Tabor and Jamie Burke) were a little nervous at the start. But they came around pretty good and made some fine throws as the practice went on.

The team, who enters practice without a set depth chart, will use the next two weeks to evaluate the young team which features 56 players who are either true or redshirt freshmen.

"We have a lot of work to do. We have a young team," head coach Don Strock said. "These next 16 days will lead us to who's going to help us win games."

"The first ten days or so, everybody's going to work. Then we'll make decisions. Somewhere around the tenth or eleventh day, they'll get into groups and we'll have the first groups and second group."

Several key players are suffering from injuries and are considered day-to-day. Receiver Harold Leath (hamstring), running back Diamos Demerritt (hamstring), defensive back Greg Moss (hamstring), defensive back Jermell Weaver (quad), running back Bill Grant (hernia) and receiver Titorian Freeman (hamstring) missed practice with injuries.

"We've got some guys who are injured and we are counting on to be part of our team and play football for us," Strock said. "They can't stay out very long cause we are going to have to make decisions quickly on who's going to line-up and play."

"The guys who are out injured – I've already personally advised them its time to step to the table. You're not going to line up on the 29th if you haven't practiced. It's that simple."

Strock and his coaching staff won't game plan for the opening game until next week.	

"I remember being in college (Virginia Tech) and we prepared for Alabama for five straight weeks and they beat us and we ended up going 0-5," said the Virginia Tech Alumni. "I don't want to put all our eggs in one basket."

"We play 11 games and we want to be competitive in all of them."

The Golden Panthers have already received a visit from a high ranking supporter.

"[FIU President Modesto Madique] came in and talked to the guys yesterday and said that this is history," Strock said. "A lot of these guys are young and maybe don't know what history is, but they will 10 or 15 or 20 years down the line."

The first full contact practice is Thursday.

Headline: Badly Drawn Boy tackles soundtrack genre
Author: Heather Brummer
&nbsp;
Who knew that Badly Drawn Boy was such a popular guy in the music industry? I was under the impression that, like so many artists these days, he had sprouted overnight. After all, before the release of the "About A Boy" soundtrack, I hadn't even heard his name. 

Now, after some research on the matter, I'm a little more versed on Badly Drawn Boy's music. He's had several CDs released, including his 2000 album, Hour of The Bewilderbeast, which proved to be quite popular in the U.K. and carved a small niche for the Boy stateside. 

Knowing more about his music, however, has not made me a fan.  

It's not that Badly Drawn Boy didn't try with "About a Boy." I can't imagine having to carry a film's soundtrack all on my own. No one said the music business would be easy but that is downright daunting.

It's not that Badly Drawn Boy's songs are hard to listen to; they aren't. It's hard to describe why I didn't connect with his music. Maybe it's that he is a soloist – his is the only main voice on the CD and I get weary of any artist who tries to carry the whole thing by himself. I think a musician needs backup and variety, at least for the listener who may get tired of hearing the same voice again and again.  

On the upside, there were a select few cuts that I found to be catchy. The title track is one I sometimes find playing in my head when I get up in the morning. Skip to "Above You Below Me" and you have another nice song, somewhat more upbeat and equally catchy. Most other tracks were fillers; not wonderful listening pieces but necessary, I suppose, for transitions between the songs. "Walking Out of Stride" didn't make much sense to me; it smacks of that "irrelevant song" feel. 

I did like "File Me Away,"which has a nice '50s vibe, but that was mostly due to the background. "Donna and Blitzen" is nice in a "the movie will be over soon so we will tie up all the loose ends" kind of way. 

Which brings us to another good point – does the soundtrack bear any resemblance to the movie? It's fair to say it does, complementing the light and airy quality of the film that stars Hugh Grant. Oh and yes, like Grant, Badly Drawn Boy is most definitely from the U.K. – a sneaky trick or mere coincidence? We may never know.

The songs, which I enjoyed, were the ones that reminded me of music from the '50s or '60s. And having said that, I think fans of the Beatles may find Badly Drawn Boy to be somewhat of a sweet memory – a couple of his songs do bear a slight resemblance to the group's music. 

All in all, I have to give kudos to Badly Drawn Boy for trying to carry an entire film's soundtrack on his own, but I would have much preferred to see his name credited alongside several other talented artists. In this case, there's a good reason people say that it takes more than one person to tell a story.

Headline: SoBe's Second Thursdays offer cultural treats
Author: Claudia Ortega
&nbsp;
The search for artistic life in Miami is not as long and arduous as most people think, as long as the person searching isn't broke. That's the predicament I'm usually in, when the trusty "dinner-and-a-movie" (which isn't that inexpensive anymore either) just doesn't do it for me.  

Luckily, the City of Miami Beach Cultural Arts Council and the Miami Beach Arts Trust are sensitive to the plight of those who aren't interested in spending $50 and up to be crammed into a claustrophobic's nightmare. Their solution?  Second Thursdays on the Beach. Don't let the rather uninspired name fool you, Second Thursdays is anything but uninspiring.

For the 75 cents it costs to cross the Don Shula extension and the cost of parking (if you don't park in the free lot near the Miami Beach Convention Center) you can be guaranteed an exciting and totally out-of-the-ordinary experience. Second Thursdays is a completely free night of activities, performances and exhibits – sure to satisfy the artistic or intellectual appetite – that attracts both locals and tourists to Miami Beach. Even the New York Times, in January 2001, included Second Thursdays on its to-do list in an article about vacationing in Miami, describing it as a "citywide multicultural open house."

The whole night is sponsored by a large number of institutions and art groups, both established and up-and-coming. The idea is to provide a venue for younger artists and groups who are trying to gain exposure. 

The program changes every month, but it ranges from yoga on the beach, to open rehearsals at the Miami City Ballet, to readings of plays, to outdoor film viewings.  You can hear music in a variety of ways – club DJ's, the New World Symphony or bootleg recordings. Besides what you would find on the printed program, impromptu performances by local artists and performers who wish to actively participate are not uncommon. A cappella groups, flamenco dancers, musicians and more can be found hanging out around Lincoln Road or Espanola Way.

Last month's performances and exhibits might give you an idea of what to expect every month. I visited Mid-Eastern Dance Exchange's "Orientalia" at the Euclid Oval on Lincoln Road from 6-7 pm, Art Center's exhibit opening "See-Saw" from seven to eight, and the Rhythm Foundation's Curated Listening session with bootleg recordings of Bob Marley's final concerts from 8-9 p.m.

 "Orientalia" was spectacular. Each dancer performed his or her own interpretations of the music and the dance form.  These included Oriental and Egyptian bellydancing, a fusion of bellydancing and flamenco, and group dances. 

The presenter of the show summed up the entire concept by saying: "I think it's important to provide our community with good entertainment and an opportunity to learn about other cultures and other forms of art."

Just about a block away is the Art Center, our next stop. The two-story building with its little studios was bustling with an interesting crowd of people. In the big exhibit space in front, the New World School of the Arts had its show "See-Saw," a play on words, as it has to do with the duality of perception. A dynamic, colorful exhibit with a variety of media, it included work from nine students, all at different grade levels within the school. Louise Romeo, the dean of Visual Arts at New World and the curator of the show, was eager to impress upon me her view that Miami is a "hotspot, a land of opportunities for young artists who can create without inhibitions." 

Ali Prosch, one of the artists, was excited about the show because of the exposure that it gave her and her friends. "It was a tremendous collaborative effort, and we all got along really well," she said.

This show even attracted a local art critic, Mark Coetzee, who is the curator at the Rubell Family Collection, one of the top 200 collections in the world.  According to him, New World alumni have gone on to enjoy a lot of fame in the art world, and he likes to keep an eye on its emerging artists.

"Exhibits like this help to expose the next generation, it forces them to consider professional practice, and it helps them learn to function in a public realm as opposed to an ivory tower," he said.  

The final part of the evening was a nice touch. In the cool air-conditioning of the Aqua Hotel, on a comfortable circular orange couch, the mellow music of Bob Marley was the soothing and perfect ending to the night.

Headline: "XXX" mimicks Bond flicks
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
In the world of action/adventure movies, names like "Die Hard" and "Bad Boys" come to mind. Then there are those movies that take time from your life that you'll never get back, such as "Eraser," "True Lies," or any Ah-nold movie.

The newly released "XXX" definitely drops the ball.  The massive promotion for "XXX" has anointed Vin Diesel as "A New Breed of Action Hero." Now I know why.  He's a mix of Tony Hawk, Spiderman and James Bond on steroids. The movie reunites Diesel with Rob Cohen, director and producer of "The Fast and The Furious," last summer's street racing epic.

Fans of senseless violence, sex and cheap jokes will love this movie. It would be good if it had one key ingredient: a plot. Let me do my best to explain to you what they considered a "plot." Vin Diesel plays Xander "XXX" Cage, an extreme sports rebel who lives for pulling life-threatening, law-breaking, impossible stunts.  After viewing one of his spectacles, the National Security Agency recruits the bad-boy to help penetrate a Russian anarchist mob in the Czech Republic who are scheming to unleash a deadly virus called "Silent Night" across the world. Along the way you witness more explosions than Geraldo saw in Afghanistan.

Surprisingly enough, the movie turns out to be anything but entertaining, even with all the explosions and unnecessary killing, and I have never said that about a movie before. This was a bad testosterone trip. I would rather watch an episode of the "Golden Girls" followed by "Oprah" than sit through this movie again. 

For what it is, "XXX" does show very impressive action stunt sequences using a wide variety of activities. Unfortunately, the stunts are over-exposed, causing a cartoonishly unrealistic, laughable show. The characters do nothing to help the movie. They are dry and stale, including Samuel L. Jackson's performance, which is by far the worst thing he's ever done. No one will care however, not when the box office numbers come in.  Money is the name of the game. It's why the movie carries a PG-13 rating. It caters straight at the confused I'm-a-rebel skateboarding-teenager crowd.  You know the ones I'm talking about. 

In modern movie fashion of course, the sequel is already in the works with Vin Diesel reportedly getting paid 20 million dollars. Nice payday too, especially for a guy who was in the movie all of 30 minutes.  The stunt double did the rest. Unless you're stoned, drunk, under the age of 15 or unable to spell the word "cat," you don't want to see this movie. It's a cheap James Bond knock off, which isn't something you want to duplicate anyway. 

If for some reason you feel that you absolutely must see this movie, take a couple of bottles with you; it'll look better blurred. Trust me: I've learned from my mistakes. Don't waste the two hours like I did.
