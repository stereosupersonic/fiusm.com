Headline: Part Two: Why New York City still matters
Author: John Colagrande, Jr./ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
This is the second segment of a three-part series detailing the misadventures of a young writer's summer travels in New York.



I was in New York on business, sort of. Wasn't getting paid. There were no meetings. And I didn't have an itinerary. My mission was to smell, touch, taste, watch, and listen to New York.

 I was writing a novel that was partly set in the city, and to add a sense of realism my memory and imagination couldn't buy, I had to be there.

Except there was a problem. How could I concentrate? New York was loud, loud, LOUD - everywhere - nonstop - the vvrroom of motors, cllck cclclk cllck of subways chugging along, the jackhammers d-d-d-d-d-d and the car horns MEEP MEEP. 

And everywhere gas and urine and exhaust - the smell leaves you exhausted - you're in Urinetown - combine it with the humid heat summer swelter, Aggghhh!

How could anybody concentrate? Then the pace, pace, pace, pace movement plus the attitude of  pissy people. Dem Nu Yawkers got serious attitude problems. 

The fight in Chelsea - a perfect example. Fourteenth street and 10th Avenue. Some bar named The Village Idiot. 

I was with an old friend from Florida, Justin Tunny. We were drinking $5 pitchers of Pabst Blue Ribbon, getting drunk.

 Women were dancing on the bar, country music blaring: "Well, I like beers in cheap places, disco bars and white racists..."

Two gringos grabbed chairs away from tables and sat on them in the middle of the big room.

 A waitress was trying to maneuver past the big guys sitting on the chairs. 

"Excuse me," said the waitress, four, five times, louder and louder, with no response. 

I took my foot and lightly kicked the back of the chair for the man to move so the waitress with the full hands could walk by.

 She was hot. Wouldn't you do the same? 

A big guy on the other chair jumped up in a state of Roid Rage and charged me. 

"Why you kick chair?" he roared. He was big, like 6-6, 230. 

Knew there was no chance of conversing with the tall, pissed, drunk, Roidmonger from Jersey. 

I foresaw bloodshed, much bloodshed, maybe my nose ring ripping off cartilage, then, just in time - not Justin Tyme, but Justin Tunny - Justin Tunny stepped right in front of me and tried to talk with Roidmonger.

 There was no talk. A fight ensued between Roidmonger and Tunny and me and Roidmonger's associate. 

Tables knocked over. There was a big ring of Junior High 'fight, fight, fight' folk.  

Bouncers broke up the melee and Roidmonger & Associate were escorted out. What the hell was that about? I had to go to New York to fight? 

Sometimes people think they have to be somewhere. They tell themselves such and such is the place to be when they've never even been there. 

South Beach, for example. 

Have you ever heard someone older talk about South Beach?

 They paint it as if it's Hedonism. As if people dance in the street naked. As if they really know what makes the beach tick. They've never been. 

I've lived on the beach. 

I think it's very touristy and compared to everywhere else in South Florida, too expensive. 

Then there's the glamour scene. 

The international foo-foo scene, which a layman would give fellatio to a horse to enter, is nothing more than the same 60 faces in different places trying to hold the fabric of their souls together by sniffing or popping the narcotic du jour. 

The foo-foo get everything for free even though their pockets are full. 

They were in the Hamptons during the summer, they're in Manhattan now, and they'll be in Miami soon enough.      

Why is it so important to be somewhere else? 

You tell yourself you need to be anywhere but where you are. 

Is here so bad?

 Is now so boring? I was starting to doubt New York - never a good idea. 

Why? Because of two things. 

One, New York is beautiful. 

Sometimes the city looked so goddamn Grand Central Howard Roarking beautiful - I'd see something - some interplay between light and shadow on an old, wonderful building - I wanted to call Spike Lee and tell him to bring down a film crew. 

Two, New York has culture. 

And that's where the key lies.



Stay tuned next week for the conclusion.

Headline: Two years later: Remembering, learning from Sept. 11
Author: Andy Diaz/ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
"And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."  - Revelations 6.4



I am writing this column on the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and I am unavoidably rerunning the events of that terrible day through my mind. I was woken up that morning by a professionally inept Katie Couric interviewing a woman after the initial strike into the south tower of the World Trade Center when mid-conversation another plane struck the second tower.

 It was at that moment that the horrible realization that this wasn't an accident came to me, along, I'm sure, with the majority of the citizens of the world.

My chain reaction of emotions triggered by the mass murders is quite ineffable but, as Greil Marcus pointed out, it was more adeptly encapsulated by the weekly internet satirical magazine The Onion's headline in their first issue after Sept. 11, 2001: "Holy F---ing S--t."

After the dust of surprise settled - even a full two years later it's hard to imagine the New York skyline sans the two towering monoliths - one feeling prevailed, anger. 

I wanted revenge. In my foreign relations class the next day, I screamed out two quotes related to Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" with a total lack of deliberation caused by overwhelming vengeful rage in a discussion; One from the book itself, "exterminate all the brutes," and the other from its cinematic spawn, "exterminate with extreme prejudice."

In the two years that have passed my take of the events has changed a lot, perhaps not as much as the Bush administration has hop scotched around their foreign policy, but considerably so.

 Today more than ever I think the acts and the people that perpetrated them are undeniably evil and the tacitly unnecessary logic for saying so is one that was initiated to prove a separate but related argument that is completely wrong. That is, whether the intent behind 9/11 was evil or not doesn't matter because the execution was.

This logical methodology was used by Harvard University President Larry Summers to denote those who want sanctions against the state of Israel and the collegiate grass roots movement to withdraw private universities' investments in companies that do business with Israel as anti-Semitic - if not in intent, then in execution. Which doesn't make any sense at all since imposing economic sanctions on the state of Israel for its systematic violations of international law is no more anti-Semitic than it is racist to impose sanctions on Charles Taylor's Liberia.

I still refuse to use the word terrorist, or even terrorism. The word and its conjugations have lost all meaning over the years, and it has almost always been used with insidious intent. Hitler and Stalin both used to refer to their enemies as terrorists. 

Perhaps the linguistic opportunism lies in the nebulous definition of the word, or all the definitions and connotations that have been added on. 

Practically anything, as history has shown, could be called terrorism. And within the context of Sept. 11 the word terrorism is almost a euphemism; after all, the 3,000 plus people who lost their lives on that day weren't so much terrorized as they were murdered. 

I only use the word terrorism in reference to the word terrorism since the mere mention of it by a public official creates terror in the population.

I hope that Sept. 11 wasn't the start of a clash of civilizations. The events weren't an attack by the Islamic World on ours, although many Muslims ignorantly rejoiced - I still feel repulsed when I see the video of demonstrators cheering and dancing in the West Bank. 

Those human guided missiles - the ultimate smart bombs - did spark a struggle, the clash of ideologies. 

Those 19 hijackers inadvertently brought to the front page the ongoing civil war between the fanatical and the rational, and although fanatics hijacked not only planes but the majority of the Muslim world, they're also a strong force within the Western World. 

They planned and executed the attacks of Sept. 11, but there was also reaction from the other side, here at home, in expected fashion. Jerry Falwell, to start at the top of the list of psychopaths, took the lachrymose day as opportunity to rail against the gays and the lesbians and whoever else leads a way of life he doesn't approve of, and blamed it on them.

 We've also seen this fanaticism resurface quite recently in the form of Alabaman fools picketing to keep a hunk of theological nonsense in a state building.

Today, as I walked the halls of the Graham Center three songs dominated that tasteless speaker system hit parade: "Battle Hymn of the Republic," made popular by a case of Civil War mistaken identity, that uninspired theme song of the Marines, and a song written by a Jewish immigrant that, when first released, was called jingoistic by liberals, and its author considered unfit to write a song about America, because he wasn't born here, by conservatives, "God Bless America" by Irvine Berlin. 

I prefer the latter. The front page of Le Monde read on Sept. 12, "We are all Americans." On the correlation of these two notes I will end my column. 

God bless America.

Headline: Professor understands students' stress
Author: Lisa Edmund/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
It took me 47 minutes to exit the Graham Center parking lot Tuesday at 2 p.m., with the endless lines of cars funneling in from the GC lots, parking garages, and Tamiami entrances all crammed into one single Bermuda-Triangle-lane of a traffic circle.

 I had a lot of time on my hands to contemplate the fact that life at UP campus has gotten more unpleasant, ridiculous, and stressful, currently bordering on intolerable.

Between overcrowding everywhere you turn, and the messy, loud and inconvenient construction all over campus, it has gotten to be such a trial just to get to class and get around campus.

Parking has my students showing up stressed and sometimes near tears 10, 15 and even 20 minutes late for class.

 Not the slackers who were in Gracie's having a beer, but the hard-working, dedicated students who are the bread and butter of this campus. 

Their schedules are tight, between working and commuting and school  - how much more silliness can they tolerate before they throw in the towel and go upstate or transfer to other, more user friendly facilities in Dade and Broward?

Every fall there is some other huge obstacle put in our way or major convenience yanked away. 

OK, so I am being petty and rigid, but little tiny inconveniences add up when FIU stacks one upon another, driving students, staff, and faculty just a little more crazy with each block of craziness. 

I miss the good old days - five or six years ago things were quite lovely and calm and pleasant on campus - where I could find decent parking, buy my lunch on campus, get from one building to another, sit outside and enjoy the Miami weather without being attacked by these cursed ducks, and yes, even buy myself a Pepsi.

It's the little dictatorial moves that drive a person crazy, such as the removal of the standard, all-welcome cafeteria, where one could buy whatever one pleased and sit comfortably in the cool air conditioning of the GC. 

As an adjunct with no office, I enjoyed meeting with students in this setting.

 It was comfortable, affordable, and convenient for all of us. 

The current cafeteria offers food at about $6 a plate, and one cannot enter the cool comfort of the cafeteria to sit and study, or converse, without, of course, ponying up that $6.

 There is no a la carte option, no "I just want to sit and study" option. I look lustfully upon the cafeteria space as I exit the Graham Center to hustle through the obstacle courses in place between GC and the library, as the cafeteria looks so blissfully quiet and calm, all those empty seats!

God forbid I forget to bring my lunch from home. 

I'm stuck in line for 40 minutes at Pollo Tropical or Subway, or left to eat scary food from the machines and left among the intolerable din of the limited seating left at the Graham Center. 

Or maybe I'll go hunker down on a bench by the library and risk getting bit by a stinkin' duck again.

Ah, forget it, I'll just buy a Pepsi and have a PowerBar.

 Oops, can't even buy a stupid Pepsi on campus anymore unless I want to suffer through said Subway and Pollo Tropical lines, as some fascist decided to only sell one brand of soda on campus.

But the dining options aren't really a factor for me the first half of the semester, anyhow. 

I am an adjunct instructor. That means I will end up waiting until Oct. 3, or maybe even Oct. 17, to receive a paycheck. 

I'll be bringing my own peanut butter sandwiches and recycled water bottles from home for the duration. 

Every semester, it seems, we part-time instructors wait longer and longer for the 'paperwork' to catch up and the paychecks to kick in. 

By the time I actually got to the dreaded traffic circle and could actually see 107th Ave., I was livid. 

Ready to take out a couple of orange cones, growling at the campus police officer trying to control traffic coming at him from five directions, realizing his job has gotten a whole lot worse, as well.

Upon my arrival at home, I turned on the television to find that violence had erupted in a parking lot at my beloved and embattled poor FIU.

Boy, was I shocked. Stunned. 

Stunned it doesn't happen more often, folks pushed to the total limit of their stress endurance.

  Robert Reich, Former Secretary Labor during the Clinton years, has written an article in the USA Today, Sep. 15, 2003, and has been on FOX news channel and MSNBC advocating taxing the rich to pay for the war. The idea is nothing new. As stated in the USA Today issue: Traditionally during war time, taxes have been raised on top incomes to pay the extra cost of war. The estate tax- overwhelmingly paid by wealthy families- was imposed by war time Republican Presidents Abe Lincoln and William McKinley. It was maintained through WW1, WW2, Korean War, Vietnam and the Cold War. Now, the estate tax is being phased out, at least until 2011, as part of the tax cut of 2001.
  As we all know Bush asked Congress for an additional $87 billion in emergency spending for military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We still haven't received financial backing from other countries which leaves the bill for Americans. I worry about all this money being thrown around. Besides the $87 billion and the already approved $79 billion for the war, our tax dollars will be used to promote marriage in America. The Bush administration is asking Congress to allocate as much as $1.5 billion in welfare funds during five years for demonstration projects on marriage education and promotion. The organization running the marriage campaign is TANF, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, which was created by the Welfare Reform Law of 1996. Seeing as my tax dollars go to the welfare, I worry about such irresponsible spending just to make people fall in love and get married. I still can't figure out where the confidence comes from thinking our tax dollars could make heterosexuals fall in love and decide to get married. 
The estate tax is out of the question to finance the war and the rich received a bigger tax break than the working class; this leaves me wondering where my next hard-earned tax dollar will be shipped to.

Hi, my name is Phil Guie, and I was a proud English major at Florida International University. Then I went on leave for a semester. ...Actually, I'm still on leave.

But the point is, I'm currently living/working in New York City, and I am in an excellent position to write movie reviews for films that won't open in South Florida until later in the year. For example, Sofia Coppola's sophomore film "Lost in Translation" opened in limited engagements two weeks ago. I've spoken to lots of old friends at FIU who are dying to see it, but won't be able to until it goes wide.

I am certain there are movies that the arts/entertainment department would love to have early reviews of. I can get those reviews. Any chance you're impressed by my chutzpa yet?

Sincerely,

Phil Guie

Headline: Parking Situation

&nbsp;
I am writing in reference to the parking situation that is happening within the FIU University Park Campus.  How can we park, when FIU has accepted too many student for the amount of parking spaces available and even so they construction that is going on throughout campus then further narrows our parking options.  They didn't calculate it properly, all they were thinking about was how much MORE money they would be recieving.  I get to school early and it takes fifteen to twenty minutes looking for parking.  I have even done the extreme of taking random people in the car with me to their parking spaces to assure a guarenteed parking space and even in those times sometimes my parking space has been attempted to be stolen.  Then again FIU is only interested in money because they go around ticketing poor people who are parked on the sides of the street after roaming around forever.  I say we hold a rally something that will open the administrations eyes to show them that we would park in spaces if they were available, but they aren't so we park elsewhere.  So what do you say lets set up a rally one day, a strike, noone go to classes just park there cars and rally!!!

Subheadline: Team wins three of four to improve to 6-2
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Sept. 9- FIU 3, FAU 0

Last season, an inexperienced FIU team that featured only two seniors started the season 0-3 and fell to FAU in the seventh match of the year at home.

What a difference an extra year can make.

The Golden Panthers, led by seven seniors, have started the season red hot, winning four of their first five matches, including a win over FAU in Boca Raton on Sept. 9.

"Our success is attributed to such a veteran group. The chemistry is very strong, and we have a different arrangement of players," said head volleyball coach Cookie Stevens.

Added Stevens: "We're not one-dimensional. We have three hitters can put the ball away this year."

And it seems like every game, a different Golden Panther is leading the way.

Against FAU, junior Jessica Jones stepped forward with one of her best all-around games at FIU. She recorded 12 kills, six digs, four assists, and four block assists as FIU won all three games of the match 30-27.

"Jessica has been such a great addition to the right side. She adds power, serves well and really hits the ball aggressively," Stevens said.

The senior tandem of Adriana Fundora and Jennifer Owens also contributed as usual. Fundora tallied eight kills and six digs, while Owens chipped in with 11 kills of her own.

Two other seniors, who have stepped their games up drastically this season, Betsy Moreland and Elizabeth Baldwin, also added to the Panther victory. 

Moreland, FIU's passing specialist this season, recorded 38 assists and nine digs and Baldwin added 13 digs.

The Golden Panthers (4-1) and Owls (1-6) shared 22 ties and 11 lead changes throughout the first two games. Jones helped clinch the first game with a kill on match point. Owens tallied two straight kills in game two to clinch it for FIU.

The Owls had control of game three with a 14-12 advantage, but FIU rallied for five straight points, capped by another kill on match point by Jones.

"I think the team has a little more faith they can pull [close] games out now," Stevens said. "They had a pressure last year, but this year they are playing with a lot more confidence."

Sept. 12- Baylor 3, FIU 1

All good things must come to an end.

That was the message sent by the Baylor Bears to the Golden Panthers as FIU's three-game winning streak came to an end with a 3-1 loss in Jacksonville in the Hampton Inn/JU Classic on Sept. 12.

Baylor (5-4), led by Tisha Schwartz's 18 kills, outplayed FIU and issued the Panthers their first loss in nearly a week.

"We were just a little intimidated by Baylor. They were bigger than us, but we played them tough, but just didn't have enough," said head coach Cookie Stevens.

Freshman Desiree Guilard-Young was brilliant for Baylor in game one, converting five kills on five attacks as the Bears cruised 30-22.

FIU junior Myriam Rodney had four kills on eight attacks in a losing effort.

"Myriam has really stepped it up for us this season," Stevens said.

The Golden Panthers (4-2) stormed back in game two, jumping out to an early 8-4 lead, but eventually was overtaken by Baylor, which won 30-28. 

Senior Jennifer Owens tallied five block assists and four kills in the game for FIU.

Owens, along with senior Adriana Fundora, led the way for FIU in game three, as the Golden Panthers led throughout and won 30-27. 

Owens recorded six kills and Fundora added three kills and five digs.

FIU staged a late rally in game four, but it wasn't enough as Baylor won 30-23.

Sept. 13- FIU 3, JU 1

The Panthers bounced back with a convincing 3-1 win over Jacksonville in the Hampton Inn/JU Classic in the first of two games for FIU on Sept.13.

Adriana Fundora came up big for FIU with 17 kills and 15 digs in the match. Jessica Jones also added 17 kills for FIU.

"Adriana is always an extremely exciting player to watch," Stevens said of Fundora's performance.

But Fundora's six kills and five digs in game one were not enough as FIU fell to Jacksonville 30-22.

Senior Betsy Moreland led the Golden Panther charge in game two with 10 assists and five digs as FIU won easily 30-19.

FIU won seven of the last 10 points in game three and won 30-28. FIU's first lead did not come until the score was 21-20.

In game four, the Golden Panthers (5-2) won seven of the first eight points and 17 of the last 26 to help seal a 30-21 victory.

Sept. 13- FIU 3, Wyo. 2

FIU showed its heart and resolve with a come-from-behind victory in the fifth and final game of its second match of the day, defeating the Wyoming Coyotes 3-2 in the Hampton Inn/JU Classic on Sept. 13.

With the victory, FIU finished in a three-way tie for first in the tournament with a 2-1 record. However, FIU could only sit and watch as Baylor won a tiebreaker for the tournament's championship with a 3-0 win over Jacksonville in the final game of the tournament.

Adriana Fundora led FIU with four kills and 12 digs in game one against Wyoming, as FIU recorded the final six points of the game to win 30-26.

"Adriana had 30 digs [in the match], which was outstanding," said head coach Cookie Stevens.

The Panthers lost games two and three despite ten kills from Jennifer Owens. But FIU fought back in game four with a dominating 30-21 win led by Fundora and Owens who each recorded five kills in the game. 

Trailing 6-2 in the final set, FIU rallied and took the game 15-12.

"The girls played outstanding. We just kept fighting hard and were able to overcome a deficit in the final game," Stevens said.

After the match, Fundora was selected to the all-tournament team.

In addition to Fundora, Stevens also credited Owens as one of the key contributors in the tournament.

"Jen had 20 kills, and had some key blocks. She also played great defense and was really a key player for us," Stevens said.

Stevens was very happy with her team after the tournament, pointing out significant improvement and a 6-2 record.

"We gained and showed a lot of experience and maturity, and I am very pleased. We're now 6-2 and have to take [the momentum] up to New England next weekend," Stevens said.

The team next travels to Durham, N.H. on Sept. 19 to take part in the New Hampshire Tournament against Syracuse, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.

It was FIU's biggest challenge of the season, and the team came out firing.

But attempt after attempt, the Billikens dodged all the Golden Panther bullets.

This was the theme of the game between No. 4 St. Louis and No. 17 FIU at Robert R. Hermann Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. 

The Billikens scored early and held off a relentless rally to preserve a 1-0 victory over the visiting Golden Panthers on Sept. 13 before a crowd of 2,923. The win was the fourth straight victory over a ranked team for St. Louis this season.

St. Louis scored in the eighth minute of play as Vedad Ibisevic directed the ball past FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg for the early 1-0 lead.

Two minutes later, the FIU rally was in full force. St. Louis had a little luck on its side when Lucas Scudeler's shot from about 25 yards out bounced off the right goalpost, helping the Billikens escape disaster.

Scudeler struck again in the 25th minute, but his shot from just inside the penalty area was saved by a diving Martin Hutton.

FIU was outshot by St. Louis 12-11, but FIU held a 17-6 corner kick advantage.

With 28 minutes remaining in the game, FIU saw a solid scoring opportunity fly away when SLU defender Kevin Wickart cleared a sailing ball off the line with a header.

Carron Williams looked to tie the game in the closing minutes, but misfired on two shots on Hutton.

St. Louis had a few opportunites of its own to increase the lead.

The second half began with SLU's Casey Spiess blasting a shot off a corner kick from teammate John DiRaimando just over the net that would have made the score 2-0.

DiRaimando almost assisted on another goal later on, but his cross was headed right of the goal by Ibisevic.

Hutton made six saves for SLU, while Rosenberg recorded five for FIU.

The win improved St. Louis' record to 5-0 and dropped FIU to 3-2 on the season, with the Golden Panthers other loss coming at the hands of SMU.

Despite the loss, FIU showed tremendous fight on the road and proved it belongs in the Top 25, after giving the fourth-ranked Billikens all they could handle in front of their home crowd.

The Golden Panthers next game is at FAU on Sept. 17.

Headline: Burke re-injures knee, out for season
Author: Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
Golden Panther quarterback Jamie Burke has begun to wonder if his misfortunes are something of a curse. 

The sophomore was diagnosed with a season-ending tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Burke, who completed 18-of-31 passes for 139 yards against Indiana State Sept. 13, will have the necessary surgery performed by team physician Keith Hecthman. The Sarasota native was granted a medical redshirt for the season.

"I feel like I have some bad luck. This is my fourth surgery in four years," said Burke, who has had two ACL operations on his right knee and is coming off left shoulder surgery. "It's definitely hard coming back from all these injuries. I have done it before and I'll do it again.

"I just wanted to make it through a season healthy."

Burke, who led all independent Division 1-AA quarterbacks with 14 touchdown passes, remained in the game after hearing a pop in the third quarter when a defensive lineman rolled on his leg shortly after he had thrown a pass.

"I've never, ever questioned Jamie's toughness," FIU coach Don Strock said. "He's come back from shoulder surgery last winter and two previous ACL operations, so if anyone can come back from this, I know he can."

In the interim FIU will turn to backup David Tabor and former scout-teamer Josh Padrick to run the offense in Burke's absence. Tabor is the only one of the three quarterbacks that has been at FIU since the program's inception in 2001 and has assumed a tremendous leadership role in the locker room-being voted third on the team's captain balloting.

He has also played sparingly in all but one of FIU's games dating back to last season. Tabor was three-of-four for 34 yards while leading the Panthers on their lone touchdown drive last week.

"I am looking forward to [starting] but losing Jamie is a big blow to our team," Tabor said. "It kind of breaks my heart, but we have to come together as a team and do what we have to."

Shaking off the rust
	
With Padrick moving up to practice with the second unit and newly appointed third-string quarterback Chris Patullo working at receiver in Harold Leath's absence, Strock took matters into his own hands and ran the scout team offense. The former Miami Dolphin quarterback looked rusty after not throwing for approximately five years but found his rhythm late in the seven-on-seven drill.

Headline: Commentary: Fans have no excuse; support needs to grow
Author: Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
What is your excuse going to be this year? 

While there will never be another jam-packed (17,000 plus fans), firework filled, Dan Marino, Mike Lowell and Jeb Bush attended game - attendance numbers last season were downright pathetic.

Following FIU's second home game, in which the team came in with a record of 1-1, attendance fizzled worse than Marlins' shortstop Alex Gonzalez in the second half of baseball's marathonic season. That is typical South Florida, though.

Unfortunately, they are the pathetic, apathetic people that drive this market where most sports come to die (i.e. hockey, soccer and the Marlins, who are constantly on and off life support). This is in a place where football not only drives the bus, heck, but also might very well own the bus in this sports landscape that is dominated by that gladiator-like, high-speed game.

This is the sport that our short attention span society craves. Why? It is easy to follow. Exciting. And downright violent. We love that - it is a societal norm. Just look at what dominates the airwaves these days. Violence, like sex, just sells, period. 

It is as difficult to follow to football as it is to follow an action flick that grosses a couple thousand bucks at the box office. Not like baseball, which has an incredibly long season that is hard to get excited over until right around this time of year, something us in South Florida have never really experienced more than once.  

Anyone and everyone can follow football and that is why attendance numbers from a Bengals game to a Raiders contest are through the roof. That is why a Northwestern vs. Dillard high school exhibition game I attended had upwards of 1,000 spectators on hand.

It is simple to keep pace. With the crackling of helmets and running of the football. Basically, in Layman's terms, for all you blondes and rich guys that drink too many beers and spend the whole game standing up in front of me talking with everyone behind you - the man with the ball must be tackled. If he is not then that might be a good thing depending which side of the line of scrimmage you are rooting for.

We crave this as a society. It is the quick fix. It is an adrenaline rush for three hours, once a week that we can deal with because we are far too busy nowadays.

For some strange reason humans crave things that are simple and quick. Our lazy and glorious lifestyle, which right down to the poorest person, may be more lavish than just about everyone else in the world. 

It is not like baseball where you have to keep track of a double switch, pitching change and sacrifice bunt by a pinch-hitter all in a span of two minutes. God forbid a sports fan in this town that has to actually pay attention and think a little bit. Yes, there are x's and o's involved in football, obviously, but the majority of people do not get into that and simply yearn for the game's simplistic, warrior-like grotesqueness. 

That is what it is. Why do we watch MTV's "Cribs", VHI's "The Fabulous Life" of (insert your favorite celebrity here) and all those stupid reality shows? We watch because it is voyeuristic and interesting to see what P Diddy spends his millions on. 

But how many of you would waste more than the seven minutes or so that "Cribs" gives to each home? Would you really spend a day at your least favorite celebrity's house to see all their bling-bling, Bentleys and anything else they could ridiculously spend their hard-earned money on? No! You want to see they have 1,200 cars and a stripper's pole in the living room, and that's it. 

Even ESPN - self-proclaimed world-wide leader in sports - is trying to become the leader in bad reality shows.

If our sports landscape has all these characteristics, then why doesn't FIU football thrive? Baseball qualified for six straight NCAA Regionals. Did you know that? I am going to go out on a big, thick limb, and say no. Because people, especially at the college level, only care about football. It is a revenue sport, that contrary to popular belief does more good than it does bad. While it does not take money out of budget to forbid printing of your syllabi, it does keep non-revenue sports such as women's golf, soccer and women's basketball afloat.

So why not FIU? Where are all the students that came out in blue and gold clad Panthers gear on Aug. 29, 2002? I understand that was an event. But the way student turnout diminished after that - in my opinion and Don Strock's is unacceptable. "I was really disappointed with the students," the second year coach said.

What is it going to take for students to come out in force and watch an FIU game? The administration has gone about ways of changing things from the way you get your tickets to promotional gimmicks to lure students to the stadium. Did you know that Papa John's is giving away FREE pizzas to the first 5,000 people through the gates? 

"Too hot" some students complained? Games were all moved to 6 p.m. or later (with the exception of homecoming and that is at 10 a.m. to accommodate NBC). And almost no games conflict with UM's home schedule. Yes, believe or not, football tried to schedule around the Hurricanes. Because Athletic Director Rick Mello knows and always preaches: "You have to build tradition." 

We all know he is not going to take someone who has rooted for the 'Canes their whole life and make them switch to FIU. That is not possible. What they are trying to do is make some room in those hearts that have been painted orange and green long before FIU dreamt about football. Merge your alliances.

We will have our answer as to whether or not students are buying into this Saturday when FIU takes on Bethune-Cookman, a perennial powerhouse in 1-AA.

More so, we will know a little further down the road, when the Panthers have their annual cross-county showdown with FAU to finish the regular season. The problem with attending this game for you all you excuse-laden students...UM plays mighty Rutgers in the Orange Bowl.

What will the excuse be? An interesting one, because whether it is the nightclub, the movies, a hot date or who knows, we never seem to run out of them in Miami.

Headline: Mistakes doom FIU again
Author: Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
Despite backup quarterback Josh Padrick's encouraging play, FIU was haunted by penalties en route to dropping its second game of the season 24-14 against the No. 18 Maine Black Bears in Portland. 

"We have to learn how to win,'' FIU coach Don Strock told the Sun-Sentinel. ``We had opportunities, but we didn't get the job done. We gave one away last week, and we had a chance this week.''

The Golden Panthers failed to score in their first three trips inside the red zone and found themselves in a 21-0 hole. Josh Padrick entered the game at this point and rallied FIU - cutting the Black Bears' lead to 21-14.

The redshirt freshman quarterback found Chris Patullo for a 21-yard touchdown pass after hitting Harold Leath on a 53-yard play that set up the score.

The drive led by Padrick, who was running the scout team last week, went for 90 yards and came to a successful halt right after the start of the game's final quarter.

FIU scored one more touchdown in their mistake-filled afternoon. This time free safety Nick Turnbull intercepted Maine quarterback Ron Whitcomb and returned the ball to one-yard line. On the ensuing play, Padrick threw into a crowd where the ball was deflected and eventually found the hands of fullback Aston Wilson. 

Padrick, who was not expected to play much, completed 18-31 passes for 192 yards. He was, however, intercepted twice - one of them on an attempt to throw the deep ball to Leath while he was blanketed by a Maine defender. The other came after receiver Andre Rollins had a pass trickle off his fingertips.

Regardless of Padrick's play, or FIU's ability to fight back from a three- touchdown discrepancy, coach Don Strock is not seeing any light at the end of this tunnel. FIU was flagged 17 times for 166 yards. "He's more athletic and makes the plays," Strock told the Sun-Sentinel of Padrick. "We have to learn how to win. It's simple."

Following a long punt return by Maine's Arel Gordon, kicker Mike Mellow nailed a 29-yard field goal to cushion the Black Bears' lead with a little over five minutes left to play.  Maine was led by junior running back Marcus Williams' 157 yards - 97 of which came in the first half.

FIU had chances to keep pace with Maine on their first drive when Diamos Demerritt carried for 23 yards to the Black Bears' 34. Tabor then completed a 17-yard pass to freshman tight end Samuel Smith. Demerritt then carried on second-and-one but was stopped and fumbled on the second effort.

Maine proceeded to drive 86 yards for their first score, a 7-yard touchdown pass from Whitcomb to receiver Kevin McMahon in the first quarter.

FIU also came away empty handed in the second quarter when a punt return was aided by holding and personal foul penalties put FIU on the Maine 33. 

Padrick went for it all and was intercepted by cornerback Manauris Arias.



Extra Points



Freshman wide receiver Patullo and fullback Wilson made the first touchdown catches of their careers...Padrick was also making his first appearance in a collegiate game...Maine was also flagged an inordinate amount of times-13 for 145 yards...Turnbull's interception was the sixth of his career, the most in school history...linebacker Mike Sherrill, a transfer from Auburn, led all defenders with 10 tackles, eight solo.

Headline: Parking situation is bad, but violence is inexcusable
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Parking is bad at University Park, there is no question about that. But to come to physical violence over a parking space is simply ridiculous.

On Sept. 9, an FIU student, Jaime Ordoñez, and his girlfriend became involved in an argument with two non-students, Howard Archer and his cousin Jason Byles, over a parking space.

The result is that neither of the parties took the space. Instead, Ordoñez was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital, and Archer and Byles are facing criminal charges after the argument turned violent and Archer beat Ordoñez with a metal socket bar.

It shouldn't have to be said, but incidents like these are evidence that some people aren't getting the picture. A parking space simply is not worth fighting over, no matter how bad parking is.

With several lots closed for construction and enrollment numbers up, parking is at a premium. Administrators understand this, and have done much with limited resources to compensate by converting the field by the University Park Apartments to a makeshift lot. Parking is also available in Lot 5, next to the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, and Lot 6 across from the University Park Towers. Trams are also available to ease the distance between the lots.
These solutions are not ideal, but until the new garages open, students, faculty, and administrators will have to exercise patience and decorum to cope with this situation.

Administrators have done a good deal, but they need to go further. Parking & Traffic needs to understand that students are not in an easy situation. They should practice leniency when ticketing parked cars.

Faculty should be understanding as well. Situations like these are exacerbated by strict attendance policies that punish tardiness severely. Students racing the clock are quicker to lose their composure and their tempers.

But most importantly, students need to take responsibility and do what's necessary to be on campus on time. Parking on this campus will be a problem. Deal with it. Start your commute earlier, utilize the alternative parking, even if it is inconvenient. And above all, no matter how stressful things may get, keep your temper under control. It's better than being in jail or in a hospital.

Headline: Kinderplay improves motor skills
Author: Issa Hosein / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Embracing the motto, "A kid's first play partner is the parent," FIU is offering the KinderPlay program, a physical education course designed to improve the motor skills of children ages three to five. 

The program, established in 1996 by Physical Education Associate Professor Bill Yongue, operates out of the Golden Panther Arena gymnasium Tuesdays from 6:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m., during the spring and fall semesters. 

FIU students assist Yongue in his tailor-made techniques, which encompass ten stations of activities, each station being a different level of difficulty. 

The routines and games designed by Yongue intend to improve the children's striking, balance, catching, kicking, jumping, spatial awareness and throwing. 

Yongue based the structure of KinderPlay on KinderSkills, a similar program West Virginia University, where he used to teach. KinderPlay has taken the program up a step, with Yongue's specially designed games and equipment, such as the balance log, balance beam and level striking. 

 Similar programs set up at West Virginia University and Temple University are based on the same goals but do not utilize many of Yongue's approaches and equipment.

Yongue, who is desperately passionate about the benefits that a physical routine can bring to a child's overall development, said that children "gauge their worth with other children they play with." 

Children who can handle themselves athletically will grow to be an individual who will interact on a much more sociable level, according to Yongue. 

"The routine has a cornerstone in fun, but the benefits to the child in terms of health, improved self-confidence and social skills cannot be ignored," Yongue said.

KinderPlay is a program that encourages the parents of the children to be present and play with the child through Yongue's surplus of activities. Karen Kalish, whose 8-year-old son was in the program for three years, credits KinderPlay for her son's improvements. 

According to Kalish, her son is now more "athletic and into sports."

KinderPlay allows parents to spend valuable time with their sons or daughters, and as Yongue puts it, "It's not the quantity of the time but the quality of the time." 

The eight-week course is open to the public and, while FIU allows free use of its facilities, There is a $30 enrollment fee charged to cover KinderPlay's budget.

Still, according to Yongue, the priceless benefits that the program offers, in terms of parent-child interaction, cannot be ignored.

"Parents have as much fun as the kids," Yongue said.  

Yongue stressed that the program allows the parent to be the teacher, and in this way, not only increases the various skills of the child, but builds the parent-child relation as well. 

"It's wonderful, and the children understand better when they play," said Martha Aguilar, whose two children, ages five and two-and-a-half are currently enrolled in the program. 

George Perez, who worked as one of the student assistants in the program for over a year and was a student of Yongue's class at FIU, praised the program and its founder. 

"He comes up with things you never thought of," Perez said.

According to Perez, Yongue knows that the kids are easily bored, so he always keeps things different, increasing difficulty levels in each of the ten stations, always changing things up to keep the kids interested. 

For more information on the program and how to enroll, call Bill Yongue at 305-348-3783.

Headline: Maidique discusses future of FIU
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor In Chief
&nbsp;
Q. There was recently talk among the state university presidents in Florida, including yourself, about enacting a cap on freshman enrollment as early as this year because of lack of state funding for enrollment growth.  What are your thoughts on enrollment caps? Would you support such a cap at FIU?

A. We had a $12 million dollar budget cut last year, an $11 million dollar cut this year, [which adds up to] $23 million. Over the past decade, we've had about $400 million of budget cuts for the [state university] system, which is upwards of $40 million for us.  What that means is that we have had to - every time that happens - take some little piece of the university away or not allow something we wanted to do, to be done.  It's been very difficult to hold, much less enhance, the quality of education that we provide.
35,000 students is huge. We're about the 15th largest university in the country.  We have no particular need to reach critical mass.  We [don't] want to get to 100,00 or 50,000 and become like one of those universities in Latin America: 200,000 students except no students come to class and only 10 percent graduate.  That's not where we want to go.  We want to go just the opposite way - higher graduation rate, higher quality.

Q. What are your general thoughts on the budget situation this year?

A. It looked very, very bad. My [analogy] - I'm not sure if you're familiar with what happens when you get lashes. Depending on the man or the woman, between 100 and 200 lashes, you die. And we were worried about getting a hundred lashes.  So when they cut it down to 10 lashes, it seemed pretty good.  And let's say each lash is a million dollars, we took 11 lashes, $11 million.

Q. Do you think tuition increases were the best solution to the budget cuts the university is facing this year?

A. We desperately need the money. We were worried about such a jolt in one year for the students, but can we use the money?  Boy, can we use the money. I'd like to see tuition double, don't get me wrong, but I'd like to see funding from the state also double. If you take away $11 million and the students pay $11 million more, where are we?  We're nowhere except the students have a bigger burden. If you're paying more, we'd like to give you more.  We'd like to not have you pay more to give you the same or less.

Q. On that subject, where do you see equity funding?

A. I think that's probably the most important initiative for the university. 
[FIU is currently funded] $45 million less that the state average when you multiply our enrollment times the state averages for lower division, upper division, graduate and doctorate. And that changes every year depending on who's over-funded, who's under-funded, and what have you.  The reason is because they have a historical model that funds universities differently. We don't go up and down together; we go up and down sideways, and the gap is made bigger. Because we get less money, we are funded with less money.

Q. What new projects or changes can we expect to see from the university this year?

A. A lot of students complain about the services that we provide when you go to the cashier's office, when you go to Admission's, and what have you. And I interviewed some of the people in those offices, and they told me 'look, we, like everybody else, want to do the best job we can, but we don't have the tools.' We don't have the systems of a 21st century organization, so we are making a tremendous investment ... to develop an information technology system that will be competitive with the very best ... systems.  
So you'll see first the student system will go up, then the financial aid system, then in a couple of years, the entire university will be using an advanced People Soft software system [called Panthersoft].
I think you're going to see, for lack of one, three parking garages with over 3,000 spots going up over the next year.
The Health and Life Sciences building will be completed, Phase II, and that will give us another boost to our research.
You will see the breaking ground of the [Chapman] Graduate School of Business.
You'll see us breaking ground for the Diaz-Balart building, which is where the law school will be housed.  You'll see us well underway in the [building of] the Frost Museum, and you'll see the recreation center coming out of the ground.
Also, you'll see the new fraternity house well underway if not finished within this year.
We've got some new PH.Ds - particularly in the bioengineering area - beginning to be established this year. And we'll have the spate of accreditations and recognitions for faculty.  I have been here now 17 years and we have never failed one accreditation.
Probably this year you'll see a new vice president for research and development, and a new dean of journalism.

Q. Any thoughts on football?

I think our football team will be outstanding this year. I think it's going to draw students, alumni and friends. With freshmen last year, we managed to put together a 5-6 record. The best thing about freshmen, they tell me as athletes, is that they're only freshmen for one year, so now we have sophomores. So I think the football team will be an important new initiative.

Q. Has the team met your expectations so far?

A. Exceeded them.  And my expectations are always very high, so for anything or anybody to exceed my expectations, that's pretty good.

Q. What about long-term goals?

A. I think our biggest long-term goals are intertwined. One is equity and the other is the medical school.  But you can't get a medical school without equity because to get a medical school [we] have to significantly boost our chemistry, biology, biochemistry and mathematics.  
All those natural sciences have to be boosted. My estimation is to bring our natural sciences - this is a gross estimate - from top 100 to top 50, it takes about $1.5 million - $2 million per natural science.
One of the things that we are seriously looking into is whether or not to make a massive push for a medical school. It would make the four-year fight for the law school seem like potatoes.
The other thing we have to take a very good look at is: do we want to be a very good division 1-AA football team or do we want to be a division 1-A football team knowing that there are greater costs? And one of the things we need to do is consult with the students to see how excited the students would be about going 1-A.
Because we are going to have to raise more money, we're going to have to put more university money into it, and we're going to have to support the team in terms of fundraising, in terms of some of the infrastructure that's necessary for football, and we're also going to have to get the students to decide whether they want to come up with a substantially higher football fee to help us get to 1-A rather than 1-AA. 

Q. How are you going to raise attendance at the games in order to claim division 1-A status?

A. You do it through marketing. You do it through the halftime show. You do it through giveaways. You do it through competitions, and you do it just through the power of 1-A football. 1-AA is very powerful. 1-A is that much more powerful in terms of interest. And Florida is a football state, so we're in the right place.

Q. Do you have at least a loose timetable in mind for the division 1-A jump?

A. We need to make a decision sometime this year.

Q. How long do you really think it will take to get a medical school?

A. To really do it, maybe 5 - 10 years. By the time we plan, and we build the infrastructure, and we hire the dean and the faculty, it could be several years.

Headline: Alex Penelas lectures on Miami-Dade's successes, challenges
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Addressing an audience of approximately 60 FIU students and faculty members, Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas delivered a speech entitled "Challenges and Opportunities: The Future of Miami-Dade County" on Sept. 10 in the Graham Center ballrooms.

The purpose of the speech was to discuss the past successes and future challenges for Miami-Dade County, said J.C. Flores, a student of FIU's Metropolitan Center, which works in conjunction with FIU.

"Penelas chose to speak at FIU because students at this school [among others] are the ones who will inherit the challenge and will be in charge of carrying on the torch in the future," said Lynn Norman-Teck, a spokesperson for the mayor. The visit was arranged by FIU President Modesto Maidique's office, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Center. 

After receiving a warm welcome from Maidique, Penelas briefly mentioned the history of Miami-Dade and a list of statistics in the status quo concerning the county. 

The mayor brought out that Miami-Dade County, which covers an area of about 2,000 square miles, has an annual budget of $5.4 billion, in contrast to its gross national product (GNP) of $70 billion. Penelas also highlighted the diversity of this bustling city.

"More than half of Miami-Dade county's residents were born outside of the United States, emigrating from more than 160 countries around the world," Penelas said.   

Upon completing this chronicle of the structure of Miami-Dade County, the mayor launched into a list of challenges the city of Miami will face in the coming years, if it has not already begun doing so. The first of these, according to the mayor, is the economy. 

In the past few years, tourism has been on the rebound and continues to gain speed as a driving force for Miami's economy. International trade and commerce are the most important industries in the status quo and, as Penelas explains, for the future. Penelas mentioned the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative, an enterprise introduced in 1994 for all countries in the western hemisphere. 

According to the North American Free Trade Agreement, once implemented, "the FTAA will eliminate trade and investment barriers on virtually all goods and services traded by member countries, reducing prices for consumers and creating new markets for producers throughout the hemisphere." 

These benefits are currently only extended to the United States, Canada and Mexico. The mayor expects the treaty to be completely ratified by 2005.

One city in the region will be named the permanent secretariat of this organization. If Miami, one of the cities in the running, were chosen, said Penelas, it would directly create about 89,000 jobs for Miami and significantly contribute to its economy. Health care is also an important issue for Penelas' office. 

"Today, 540,000 residents of Miami-Dade County live without medical insurance," Penelas said. "Of this number, 100,000 are children."

In response to this problem, the mayor's health care access task force brainstormed last year, and came up with different steps the county can take to alleviate the problem, one of which is a federally funded program called KidCare, which will provide free medical for children under the age of 19 who do not qualify for Medicare, but cannot afford health care. 

Transportation, the third issue discussed, included traditional cars, trucks and buses, and also Miami International Airport and the Port of Miami. The airport, which added a fourth runway a few months ago, contributes about $18 billion to the economy each year, Penelas said. 

Education and crime were the last two major issues that were mentioned. According to Penelas, for the past two years, he has been planning what he referred to as the "Pre-K Initiative." This program will allow all 4-year-olds to enroll in a pre-kindergarten class free of charge, as with basic public school. Last year, the City of Miami-Dade voted on the initiative and it passed with an overwhelming vote of approval, Penelas said. The mayor is working on getting the program implemented throughout the entire state of Florida by the year 2005. 

Lastly, the mayor announced that violent crime in Miami-Dade County is at its lowest level in 25 years. After the conclusion of his speech, Penelas engaged in a panel discussion with FIU political science students. 

"Students for the panel were chosen because they were political science majors and were familiar with Miami politics," said President of University Park Student Government Council Clayton Solomon, who served on the panel.

 After answering questions from the panel concerning education and ethnicity, Penelas fielded questions from the audience. Many FIU faculty members took time out of their day to come and listen to the mayor speak.

"He might aspire to a higher office. Plus, I was interested to know how he regards the university as part of his plans for the city," said Carol Damian, chair of the art department.

Students also enjoyed the visit.

"[Attending the speech] wasn't a chore. I was happy to be there," said FIU Student Ambassador Myriam Polo.

Four of the nation's top union leaders were arrested on Sept. 13, along with over 100 prominent union members, as they led a crowd of 5,000 outside of Yale University in support of workers on strike.

The four union presidents were charged with civil disobedience when they blocked traffic in an effort to involve all of organized labor in the dispute between Yale and its 2,000 striking workers.

The sit-in for which laborers were arrested was part of an ongoing struggle against Yale University in relation to its clerical, dining hall, and maintenance employees, who claim that the prestigious school insults its workers with unjust low wages and pensions.

Headline: Student injured during violent parking dispute
Author: Angela Castillo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A violent dispute over a parking space at the University Park campus resulted in an FIU student being airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital for a head injury and the arrest of two men on Sept. 9. 

According to the FIU Police Department, at approximately 12:30 p.m., FIU student Jaime Ordonez's girlfriend got involved in a verbal altercation with Howard D. Archer Jr., 20, and his cousin, Jason Byles, 19, not students of FIU, over a parking space in Lot 2B, located adjacent to the Graham Center, outside of the campus bookstore. 

When Ordonez, 24, approached the two men to defend his girlfriend, he and Byles started fighting when Archer ran back to his vehicle, grabbed a metal socket breaker bar, and beat Ordonez in the head and body, police said. 

Ordonez's girlfriend then began trying to defend her boyfriend by hitting the alleged attackers with an umbrella. Archer then went into the Ordonez's car in an attempt to steal it, and begaan driving away, but Ordonez's girlfriend jumped in the vehicle and forced Archer out of the car.  Once out of the vehicle, Archer picked up a rock and threw it at the car, causing damage to the front windshield and another vehicle parked in the area, police said.

According to FIU Police Officer Darwin Villavicencio, when he approached the crime scene, he heard "the victim's girlfriend shouting and stating that the suspects were leaving." 

Villavicencio said that he noticed the vehicle of the alleged offenders, proceeded to follow them, and ordered them to stop. Archer, the driver, kept driving until the police patrol vehicle intersected him, police said.

"I ordered them to exit his vehicle. Both offenders exited the vehicle, and as I was placing Mr. Archer in handcuffs, he made a sudden movement and physically resisted my attempt to place him in handcuffs by turning in my direction and tensioning his body and arms," Villavicencio said. 

Villavicencio said that as a result, he felt compelled to request assistance from other units in the area. Both offenders, Villavicencio said, represented a threat to his safety and the safety of FIU's community.

Ordonez, who was airlifted to Jackson Memorial's Trauma Unit, suffered post broken bones, laceration, and other post-internal injuries. 

Ordonez was in stable condition by late afternoon and was discharged from the hospital the following day. 

Byles, 19, also suffered injuries and was taken to the emergency room at Kendall Regional Medical Center, where he was placed under police custody. Byles was discharged from the hospital Sept. 9 and arrested the same evening. He faces charges of aggravated battery and disorderly conduct.

Archer was treated for minor injuries by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, and then transported to Miami-Dade County Jail, where he was brought up on four charges, including aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, disorderly conduct, motor vehicle theft, and resisting arrest with violence. 

FIU students say parking is not worth fighting for. 

"We're too young to let parking spaces get us all worked up, and much less, hurt, like those in this recent incident," senior Mariela Campuzano said.

Still, some students do get worked up and say that parking is cause for frustration. 

"When I first heard about [the incident], I started to laugh, because I knew it was bound to happen." said Edwin Perez, chief justice of the Interfratenity Council. "I feel worried that I might end up in a fight just for a parking spot, because I see myself getting aggressive when someone takes my parking spot. "

Headline: Panther Rage ignites tradition
Author: Tuere Allwood/ Acting News Editor
&nbsp;
To increase panther pride in FIU football, Panther Rage will set tradition by lighting a bonfire on Sept.18 in the Greek housing lot, in symbolization of FIU's intention to "roast" its opponent, Bethune-Cookman College, at the first home football game of the season.

FIU will play against BCC for the second time on Sept. 20. 

"Last year, we got slaughtered by Bethune-Cookman," said Panther Rage President Shaun Alcindor. This year, FIU has another plan in store for the BCC Wild Cats, Alcindor said.

For the bonfire, Panther Rage will stack piles of wood ten feet high in the Greek lot adjacent to the Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) house. 

On top will rest a coffin containing a symbol of BCC's mascot, the Wild Cat. Panther Rage plans to have FIU Football Coach Don Strock, who is captain of the team, ignite the huge fire anywhere between 8:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.

The message intended: "Burn the Wild Cats," Alcindor said.

Because Panther Rage has been searching for improved methods of ushering in new traditions, Alcindor proposed the bonfire as the classic way to bring school spirit to FIU.

"I have been a boy scout forever, and one of the traditions to get everyone spirited is with a bonfire. So I thought it would be an excellent idea," Alcindor said.

Panther Rage has carefully planned the event, giving significance to even the location and time. According to Alcindor, the bonfire would originally cater to housing students. This arrangement changed when Marlon Font, corresponding secretary of FIJI and president of the Student Alumni Association, pointed out that a number of Greek fraternities are also part of housing, as the FIJI house is located on campus and at the end of the year, construction will begin for four more Greek houses, accommodating the fraternities Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and Pi Kappa Alpha. 

Font also pointed out that many commuter students are very involved at FIU, so the bonfire should be hosted on the lot where the SIG EP house will be built, as it is at the entrance of FIU, and the same location where Panther Rage hosted a bonfire two years ago. Panther Rage decided to light the bonfire around 9 p.m. because this is when many commuter students travel in and out of the campus.

"The whole purpose is to have school spirit and pride in FIU. We saw this as a great opportunity to bring back the bonfire tradition that started two years ago, and let students know that there is a new, safe spot on campus where people can have fun," Font said.

"This is the first few steps of building that tradition of going to the Greek housing for a good time," Font added.

After the bonfire, soft drinks, food, and entertainment will be provided, courtesy of FIJI and the Residence Hall Association, in the house and its back lawn.

"This is not a FIJI-Panther Rage party. This is a party for the FIU community," Font said. 

Alcindor agreed that it is important to go out to different buildings to increase membership, as there are an average of 10,000 to 15,000 students on campus every day.

"FIU is a very young school. So it's important to begin building traditions, increasing involvement in FIU activities, and getting people out to games," Alcindor said.

Getting people out to games is one of the main challenges that Panther Rage is trying to overcome. 

According to Alcindor, FIU intends the football team to soon achieve status as a Division I-A team. Still, this can only happen if FIU home games can attract enough people to fill the football stadium, which has a capacity this year of 12,673.  Panther Rage's goal is to get at least 5,000 to 6,000 FIU students at every game, and the same amount of alumni, Alcindor said.

"If it's one place where people can come together with a common goal, it's the football field. So we are just supporting our team," said Manny Rosa, coordinator of Campus Life.

Rosa said there are a number of events, surrounding the bonfire, that have been planned to hype up students before and after the game, win or lose. 

The bonfire will kick-off the events on Thursday night. 

"All big schools have traditions," Alcindor said. "We want to bring that 'big school' spirit into FIU."

On Friday, there will be a GradSkellar party for graduate students from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Gracie's Grill, located in the Graham Center. Following will be a Student Programming Council comedy show and football skit at 9 p.m. in the GC ballrooms. 

On Saturday, game day, Panther Rage will host "Follow the Roar," a decoration contest along with other festivities from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. At 5 p.m. there will be a pre-game festival, "Live from Lot 6," located in the parking lot directly adjacent to the "Cage," or stadium. 

This event will include music by DJ Access, food, and giveaways. It will be video taped and played throughout the following week in Gracie's Grill. There will also be a pre-game pool party in the center of housing complexes Panther Hall, University Park Towers, and Everglades Hall. According to Rosa, after the game, there will be a party in Gracie's Grill at 10 p.m. Panther Rage plans to continue issuing new forms of entertainment for the benefit of students, FIU football, and the university community as a whole.

According to Alcindor, "universities are also about social life and interaction. Attending sporting events is an integral part of the holistic development of a student."

Headline: FIU radio show in need of staff changes
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
There are a million things to do on Fridays between the hours of 3 and 7 p.m. 

Everyone knows that. Laundry, oil changes, eating, cashing paychecks, doing homework (yeah, right); many are stuck in rush hour traffic. 

The real question is what is there to listen to while going about your crazy day. 

Scan your radio to 88.1 FM and you'll be listening to Bipolar Radio right from FIU. It's a four-hour-long show that's  half news, half arts, all discussion. 

With eight staff members coming in and out of the studio, guest speakers, and interviews being conducted all the time, it's a show that's sure to give you every point of view on FIU news and current arts and entertainment.

From 3 to 5 p.m., Frank Perez, Armando Rodriguez and Krystal Alvarez go over local and national news, from the student's perspective. News is given sketchily, and somewhat randomly, by Alvarez, as she desperately tries to interject on the tangents which her co-hosts run rampant with. 

Perez is the most risqué of the hosts, often trying to emulate popular radio man Howard Stern by quoting, verbatim, what he says. This is your typical college student radio show host. 

Alvarez averts the topic away from sex again and again, and throws out another piece of news quickly, before Perez gets to say "penis" on the air one more time. Rodriguez doesn't really succeed in calming Perez down as he hits on everything he thinks might have a vagina, but he doesn't really help Alvarez either. 

Often times there are as many as five people on the air at the same time, laughing, debating and the listener has no clue as to who is saying what or what is being said at all. 

The news is given and discussed, but sometimes, (most of the time) is quite choppy. 

Of course, the problem is getting the news said, without boring the audience. Unfortunately,  some middle ground needs to be found, because sometimes listening to them is like driving in rush hour traffic. Just when you think you're getting someplace, there's a delay. 

Topics drag to the point of annoyance, but if you're not really listening for the news, and you probably aren't, and you like Howard Stern, this might just be the show for you. 

Alvarez blushes so hard sometimes from the things these psuedo-sexist radio personalities say, you can feel the heat steaming from your speakers. 

I really do feel embarrassed for Perez sometimes, from the things he says, but just like the guests on "The Jerry Springer Show," it is definitely part of the show's appeal. Being the official news assistant, Alvarez leaves the show at five and gives room to other hosts, like Jorge Demoya, who run the Straight to Video segment, focusing mainly on movies. 

The boys give their  biased reviews, giving the best ratings to those films with the most female nudity, (they must've really liked "About Schmidt") and then atone for it by hitting on any girl in the studio. 

This show leaves a lot more room for creativity as they play games, talk crap and continue to take callers. 

The news segment, often taken from the pages of The Beacon, is good in that it is well informed on FIU events, although it is sometimes inaccurate and unprepared. 

The Straight to Video segment is exactly as it should be: college kids giving their opinions on movies, which is just about the only activity many college students can afford to do. 

The vision in the show is to blend the news and the entertainment so its students discussing both topics at different times. But I don't think that distinction comes across. The main reason: Perez. He is made most wonderfully, for the Straight to Video segment, but the news is just not his bag, baby. 

I could see this show being taken seriously if Rodriguez and Alvarez were the main co-hosts for the news, and Perez, Demoya and Rodriguez were the main co-hosts for the Arts. 

Of course, that would mean two shows, but there is nothing wrong with that. 

Too much blending of mismatched personalities and topics and you've got a distasteful audio buffet for a pregnant woman. 

Just imagine: Howard Stern meets NPR meets Jesse Camp; that's Bipolar Radio, in all it's "Animal House" glory.

Headline: AGA: more than just a club
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Geeks. Computer Nerds. Weirdos. 

Call them what you will, the members of Anything Goes Anime are not to be taken lightly. 

I must admit my arrogance and say that, up until last summer, I never thought FIU's anime club was anything more than a bunch of kids who play video games and watch perverted Japanese cartoons. 

I should also mention that it wasn't until my first anime exposure around the same time, that I even realized why the club members have such a passion for these films, which are way more than just cartoons. 

After all, the popularity of this genre has seen a recent increase over the last few years, especially with the praised film by Hiyao Miyazaki, "Spirited Away," which won the Academy Award for best animated film at the Oscars last year.

To put it simply, Anything Goes Anime is an organized group of FIU students, and non-students, who convene once a week to watch an anime series. 

A series is one particular anime, divided into several episodes. In Japan, it's television programming. 

One can get an idea of what exactly a series is by watching the Adult Swim segment Sunday through Thursday on the Cartoon Network; they air several anime series.

The club will watch about two episodes a night, moving from series to series.  

Each semester, AGA tries to watch four or more series, depending on the availability. 

This fall, they will be showing "Naruto," the popular "Hellsing" series, "Narueska" and "One Piece," among others.

They also hold special anime lunches twice a month, where the group will gather at FIU for lunch and show an anime film or a short series, which is about six episodes. 

If you plan to attend an anime lunch, expect to see the films "Golden Boy" and "Samurai X."

AGA is a lot more than just watching anime though, it started out as a society of people who come together and share their passion for anime. 

But after a few minutes spent with them, you begin to realize that it's more of a family than a society. 

Everyone pretty much knows everybody else, and there's a warm, friendly kind of feeling when you join the group for a meeting or viewing. 

"Our club is open to just about anyone who wants to come," said loyal club member Melissa-Nicole Greco. 

"It's absolutely free to join, so just show up and assimilate yourself amongst the group."

Just like any group or club, Anything Goes Anime has it's woes and foes. 

On Sept. 11, I attended a meeting and happened to stumble upon a debate between several candidates running for official positions within the club. 

The politics of running an anime club unraveled before me, as they debated the various issues facing their organization.

The biggest problem addressed was the availability of GC 140, the small auditorium with a projector and screen. 

AGA is constantly competing with other groups, mainly SPC, for the use of the room. 

Club member Deanna Echanique, who is also running for an official position, commented on the issue. 

"SPC has priority over us and reserves the room every Thursday night, which is when we meet.

"They consistently do not use the room and cancel at the last minute, so we're never sure where we're going to be each week."

This semester the club meets every Thursday night, either in GC 140 from 7 - 11 p.m. or in CP 145 from 8 - 12 p.m. It depends on the availability of the projector-equipped rooms, a necessity for showing films.

"This club has grown a lot, each meeting we have anywhere between 40 and 60 people come, sometimes more," said club member Teresa Montgomery. 

With this large attendance, it's imperative they have a room with a projector and large screen. 

AGA is currently working with the Student Organization Council to solve the issue regarding room reservations.

The anime club should not be overlooked. It's a very serious, very professional organization. 

On July 26, they staged FIU's first anime/Japanese culture convention at FIU, Yasumi Con. 

Drawing a crowd of over 1,200 people from all over the South Florida area, the convention was a great success for AGA which hopes to repeat it next summer. 

Perhaps the most gratifying feeling is feeling welcome and knowing that you're in a place where you feel at home. 

With a hobby that gets looked down on and made fun of so often, it's nice to have an organization like this one. 

The members share a real understanding and enthusiasm for the genre and culture surrounding anime, but most of all, they share an understanding and enthusiasm for each other. 

Anything Goes Anime should be a role-model to other clubs at FIU.

"Since I've joined Anything Goes, it's become my second home," said anime supplier and faithful club member Joel Creme. 

"Before the con [convention] started, I only expected about 500 people would show up at the most. I'm really proud of this club, I love it, these people are my family."

Headline: Ritter dies at 54 of heart problem
Author: By Hal Boedeker / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
Most actors detest docudramas about their lives. Not John Ritter. He praised an NBC film earlier this year about "Three's Company," befriended the actor who played him and saluted former co-star Joyce DeWitt, who co-produced the tell-all about the ABC sitcom.

"The thing I loved was what Joyce said at the end," Ritter said in a phone interview this spring. "With all that's been said and done, we all do care about each other. This movie tries to highlight the dark side, but it was so much fun. We knew how much fun we were having."

Ritter, who helped turn "Three's Company" into one of the biggest hits of 1970s and 1980s, died Thursday from a heart problem that had gone undetected. His publicist cited a dissection of the aorta as the cause. Ritter would have turned 55 next week.

His death threw into doubt the future of his current sitcom, "8 Simple Rules ... for Dating My Teenage Daughter." Ritter became ill on the set Thursday and later died at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif.

He is survived by his wife, actress Amy Yasbeck, and their daughter, Stella, who turned 5 Thursday. He had three grown children from a previous marriage: Jason, Carly and Tyler.

The Tuesday series was a modest success when it debuted last season, but ABC executives trumpeted it as a sign of the broadcaster's turnaround. A network statement read: "All of us at ABC, Touchstone Television and the Walt Disney Co. are shocked and heartbroken at the terrible news of John's passing."

His death is a major blow to the Disney-owned network because, quite simply, he was the show as well-meaning but exasperated father Paul Hennessy. His passing raised speculation: How do they continue with the show? And could any actor replace Ritter?

There was wonderful irony in the casting of Ritter on "8 Simple Rules": Hennessy spent his time protecting his two daughters from bumbling skirt-chasers like Tripper.

Ritter reveled in his success but never played the prima donna. Born Sept. 17, 1948, he was the son of singing cowboy Tex Ritter, and he understood the ways of show business.In a 1991 interview with the Orlando Sentinel, he talked about his film "Problem Child." "It's a movie the critics loved to hate and the public loved to see," he said.

Then he was shooting "Problem Child 2" in Orlando, and he didn't seem concerned about the critical reception for it. "This movie, while it's fun to do, is not something I take seriously," he said. "What I care about are other projects that I invest a lot more in."

He continued playing Tripper in the short-lived ABC spinoff "Three's a Crowd" in 1984 - 85. In other major series roles, he was a minister on "The Waltons," a police detective on "Hooperman" and a senator's legislative assistant on "Hearts Afire."

The hard-working Ritter amassed many credits. 

Ritter appeared in ABC's celebration of its 50th anniversary in the spring and recalled that he met Winkler at the 25th anniversary shindig. 

"He was the Fonz, and I was just starting out in my show," Ritter said. "That night I was so happy to be in the door. I was happy to rent a tuxedo."

Ritter described the 50th anniversary celebration as poignant for him, because it was at the Pantages Theatre, where his father had sung "High Noon" ("Do Not Forsake Me," "Oh My Darlin'") during the Oscar telecast in 1953.

"It had an old-time feel, touching and fun," he said of the ABC event. "It's so typically American, this feeling of `it means a lot to us, but we see the humor.' We've been hit and miss, but we've been coming at you 50 years. It's really impressive."

Most actors would ignore docudramas about themselves, but Ritter praised the NBC movie "Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of `Three's Company.'" "I thought it was an amazing, energetic production and captured the 1970s," he said. 

He raved over the actor playing him, Bret Anthony, and said they had become friends. Although Ritter complained that scenes between co-star Somers and her husband Alan Hamel were "creepy" and "unfair," he liked the movie.

Back then, ABC executives offered "huge and extensive" notes about what to fix on "Three's Company," Ritter said. "Whoever got the shortest straw had to be the representative with the network," he added. But there were no hard feelings. "We did all right by the network, and the network did all right by us," he said.

Headline: Labels: Can't live with or without them
Author: By Robert Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I started a diet this week and have become obsessed with reading nutrition labels. 

This got me thinking about labels in general. Why is it that people are always against being labeled? 

We categorize everything from the food we eat, to the clothing we wear. 

It is only natural to take it to the next level and put people into categories, no?

What is the big deal about labeling people? I label just about everything (my notebooks, CDs and such), but when it comes to putting people into categories, it becomes a politically incorrect thing. 

I just don't see what the big deal is. 

Labels allow us to respect people for what they are instead of making people look like what they are not. 

Take Madonna for instance. 

She has always sought to be labeled "controversial" or "provocative" (and a singer, at times). 

Madge, as she's also called, always tries to stand out and be in your face with her gay antics. 

I would personally label her a "publicity whore." 

Looking at it from my perspective, she is a master of her craft. 

She's knows how to get people to start talking about her public persona and stop questioning her talent (or lack thereof). 

Now that is respectable. 

The truth is that being labeled and put into categories can save you. 

Another beneficiary of proper labeling would be Madonna's new toy - Miss Britney Jean Spears. 

Britney's current label would probably be something along the lines of "no talent hack."

I would propose that she be tagged "filet mignon" because she is the best piece of meat on the pop-market today. 

This way, people focus less on her haphazard attempt to sing live, and more on what really matters to most people watching her: what she looks like.  

The looks thing is what seems to upset most people. Labeling someone "hot" supposedly implies that people who don't look as good are ugly. 

I personally find this ridiculous. 

If I want to call someone hot, I will without trepidation. 

I do not think it is shallow to say someone like Britney has a beautiful body. 

She works hard to maintain her shape and deserves credit for it. 

Does that make me an aesthetics-obsessed pig? 

No. I just call them as I see them. 

Janine Garofalo is the number one label-hater. She doesn't consider herself a celebrity. 

Quite frankly, I don't think anyone else does either. She is one of those people who make it seem like they don't care about looks. 

I beg to differ. 

If she didn't care about looks, she wouldn't dye her hair or get tattoos. 

She just prefers to make herself look unfeminine.   

The point is that looks still matter to people like her. 

She can try to evade being considered famous by making bad movies like "Mystery Men," but she can't escape the fact that she is one of those "looks don't matter" girls.

In the end, food is much more easily labeled than people. The fact is that people will never allow themselves to be properly labeled because they don't want to see things as they are. 

Sure, there are people who surpass all labels, but they are very few and far between. 

The point is that if I categorize people in my head, I should be able to talk about it without being harassed.

 I am sick of biting my tongue for fear of being labeled "politically incorrect." 

I'm OK with that label right now. Capisce?

Headline: Award-winning authors to attend Writers on the Bay
Author: By Robert J. Gramatges / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Anyone who enjoys a good book would love what the Creative Writing Program has cooked up with their Writers on the Bay series. 

They have invited a slew of writers to share their works with FIU students at the Biscayne Bay Campus through readings, class visits and socials. 

Past writers include the likes of Derek Walcott, Marianne Boruch, Lolita Hernandez and Tom Piazza.

It is very satisfying to be able to discuss a story's ending with the person who wrote it. 

Future writers and avid readers will have the privilege to ask and/or comment about what they liked, admired or detested to the authors themselves. 

Talk about closure.

It Still Moves: Sublimely perfect combination of americana and shoe-gazing music
There's nothing flashy or attention-catching about Jim James and his four friends who comprise the Kentucky-based band My Morning Jacket. 
Their music, on the other hand, will capture your heart and your intellect. 
It's refreshing to a see a group of guys as down to earth as they are producing music that can lift their audience into aural heaven. 
The band's latest CD, It Still Moves, does not deviate much from their earlier work, but it also certainly does not stretch their talent and creativity to its end: You can hear it in every beat of every song.  
Not unlike the band's previous recordings, It Still Moves is a sublimely perfect combination of  americana and shoe-gazing music that will take you to both higher highs and lower lows. 
The band is in no rush, which is superbly demonstrated in "I Will Sing You Songs," a nine-minute and 18-second long song that keeps its listeners' active attention despite its length and, at times, seemingly slow pace.
Still, the quintet has more surprises waiting just around the corner in the next song, "Easy Morning Rebel," which does not sacrifice quality for a quicker pace (there's even a wind section included). Even after the CD has ended, James' familiarly haunting and desperate voice leaves you with an aftertaste that keeps you craving more. Most bands try to achieve this effect,  but never actually succeed. My Morning Jacket makes writing good music look second nature to breathing every few seconds. 
My Morning Jacket is touring this month and in October. Currently, there are no shows scheduled in Florida whatsoever, but hardcore fans can catch them in Athens, Ga. (the closest show available) and in New York, at the CMJ Music Marathon. Of course, don't forget to visit their website: http://www.mymorningjacket.com if you're interested in either learning more about the band or trying to convince them that it would be worth it for them visit us!

"Once Upon a Time in Mexico": Pure myth, pure fun  
In the opening scenes of "Once Upon a Time in Mexico," Robert Rodriguez' last installment of the "El Mariachi" trilogy, you are told that the story that you are about to see is a legend, based partly, if not entirely, upon myth. 
It is with this idea in mind that one must view and ultimately enjoy the film. 
At times, you will see things that you will find completely implausible and far-fetched, and if you aren't comfortable with the notion of urban myths and legends, then this film will seem like a complete waste of time. 
I say this because these are some of the comments that I encountered as I left the theater, and while I believe that everyone is entitled to their opinion, i.e. everyone's a critic, I can't help but feel that they are entirely unwarranted.
I admit that some dialogue in the film is cheesy, and yes, I also think that the 'fast' editing approach that Rodriguez employs in the film hinders, at times, the progression of the narrative, but I also have to acknowledge that these are only minor flaws and in no way do they prevent the movie from being the incredibly entertaining western-action film that it is. 
This film makes me wish that all action films took place in Mexico (the city itself is breathtaking and also serves as a character in the film) and that they all could employ leading men even half as engaging as Antonio Banderas' el Mariachi. 
Watching him on-screen is like watching a Latin Clint Eastwood, but with far better hair and deep, penetrating eyes. 
I'll take Antonio Banderas, action hero, over Arnold Schwarzenegger, pseudo politician, any day.  
For me, however, the biggest (and the most unlikely) thrill in "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" came from the stylized ballet-like action sequences that Banderas and his band of pistoleros often executed. 
The action sequences are so well choreographed that they have a refreshing style and grace to them that makes you feel like you are watching some elaborate dance routine, albeit one that involves very big guns, rather than the bloodshed that is actually happening on screen. 
It is just another example of the creative genius that Robert Rodriguez brings to this film, as well as all of his films. 
He has learned to use what he has, rather than CGI-ing his way out of filmmaking, and I can't help but think (with a swelling sense of pride) that only a true Mexican could make it look this good.

"Matchstick Men": Laughs, tears and surprises
The chance to take a look at the story of one lonely, obsessive-compulsive con-man was an offer I couldn't give up.  
"Matchstick Men" is the story of Roy (Nicolas Cage), a professional con-man with a haunting past that leaves him obsessed with every little dust ball in his seemingly immaculate house. His comical partner in crime (literally), Frank, (Sam Rockwell) is trying to get him out of this rut so they can continue with their scam.  
When Roy accidentally flushes his little pink pills down the drain, he starts having an array of OCD episodes. His need for cleanliness and constant twitching make it impossible for Roy to function as a human being, let alone work. He goes to a psychiatrist as a last resort and starts telling the doctor about his life as an "antiques' dealer," his past marriage and the daughter he left behind before her birth.
Finally, after a couple of visits, he tells the doctor to call his long lost 14-year-old daughter. After the first painstakingly anxious visit, Angela (Allison Lohman) wedges herself into his life, changing it and his sporadic twitching forever. 
The movie toys with the audience while making them experience every range of emotion. When Frank eats a Big Mac and leaves pieces of lettuce and sesame seed bun all over Roy's spotless blue carpet and mocks Roy's OCD condition, the audience will roar with laughter. 
Yet, you still like this loveable goofball and his ambitious character.  
The room will also fill with "awws" as Angela and Roy share some New York Super Chunk Fudge ice cream without him even thinking about her dirty chocolate-covered mouth. Even when Roy teaches Angela the inner-workings of a con, the innocence and sweetness of the scene makes you long for such a pure bonding experience. 
Nicolas Cage and Allison Lohman make the perfect father-daughter combination. They are way too cute. Between Angela's naïve nature and her curiosity of her dad's profession, and Roy's newfound parenting experience, they convey a tenderness that is not easy replicable.  
Sam Rockwell also does a great job as the jealous sidekick and irreplaceable funnyman. 
The ending will display the final range of emotion: surprise, sadness and hope. It is sure to leave audiences wide-eyed and shocked. 
This movie is worth every cent of investment and should even give Cage, Lohman or Rockwell some sort of Academy nomination for their outstanding acting efforts. 
This movie is the perfect blend of stellar acting and awesome plot. It will make audiences want to have a Matchstick Daddy or at least an off-beat "antiques' dealer."

"Cabin Fever": The latest corpsapalooza to hit the theaters
It's getting so you can't swing a rotting corpse without hitting a new horror movie about a flesh-eating virus.
"Cabin Fever," the latest corpsapalooza, was completed more than a year ago and should have come out then. 
That way, it wouldn't be the third movie in a year about a freaky virus ("Dreamcatcher" and "28 Days Later" preceded it). 
It wouldn't be the third movie about young people who meet bloody fates in a deserted cabin ("Wrong Turn" and the ingenious "Dog Soldiers" have been there). 
And it wouldn't be the third teenagers-face-insane-amounts-of-gore movie ("Final Destination 2" and "Freddy Vs. Jason" got there first).
From promising first-time director Eli Roth, "Cabin Fever" is better than a couple of those movies, but it's not as good as most of them. 
Roth cooks up some inventive mayhem, but the movie is held back by his clueless approach to sexuality (in a genre known for them, "Cabin" includes the all-time least-motivated sex scene, plus there's a rape scene that's grotesque because Roth seems not to know it's rape) and by its everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sloppiness.
Even if you give "Cabin" the benefit of the doubt and chalk some of its goofiness up to parody, it's a mess. 
Consider, for instance, the scene in which a woman, covered with festering wounds, decides to shave her rotting legs and take advantage of the opportunity to display her ample, nonfestering breasts. 
That's either kinda funny or kinda pathetic, depending on how you look at it, but there's no way to account for the way "Cabin" mishmashes together every plot element from every slasher film you've ever seen, without adding anything new.
Roth needs to learn to simplify. Earlier this year, "Final Destination 2" was lots of fun because its premise was so straight-ahead and relentless. 
"Cabin Fever," by contrast, is all over the bloody place.

I am a FIU journalism student, interning in Washington, DC. Through the experience I am gaining, I have found many ways students can get involved in the federal, state and local sides of the education process. FIU's Governmental Relations department offers many resources for students, faculty and alums to get involved. I wanted to know if I could submit an article on the Governmental Relations team and the resources available for advocacy. If so, when is the deadline and when will it be published in the Beacon.
Thank you for your time,

Headline: Educating the 9 Dwarfs

The position of the liberals on Iraq as it relates to the War on Terror and the War on Terror itself is very easy to understand. If you watched Hannity and Colmes last night the position of Chapiqua Ted is to totally ignore September 11, 2001. According to both Teds (Turner and Kennedy) the citizens of this country died in vain. Their position is to wait until we are attacked on our soil--to wait for thousands of Americans to die first before we act to the gathering dangers this country would have inevitably faced until a very courageous President stepped up and lead a great coalition against the terrorists. Kennedy's Press secretary echoed what Kennedy and the rest of the liberal henchmen in this country and the socialist/nazi brothers and sisters of these liberals are saying: The lessons of 9-11 are that we have to appease the terrorists. Did anyone read my brilliant messageboard on how to defeat terrorists? Does anyone not understand why we cannot negotiate with terrorists? It wasn't just a slogan from President Reagan--it is an elucidation of the reality of terrorists. By definition terrorists do not utilize reasoning or logic. It is just like liberalism. Both liberals and terrorists utilize emotions and that is how they define their actions. I'm not saying that terrorists and liberals are the same, I am just bringing to fruition the reality of why it is IMPOSSIBLE to deal with terrorists in any other way than to kill them. 

Some liberals say that the war on Afghanistan is justified only because we waited for the terrorists to attack us on our own soil. The liberal international policy is to wait for thousands of Americans to die first before anything is done. And these 9 dwarfs believe that Americans will elect them to lead our nation? Come on!! Clinton did nothing but talk when American citizens were killed outside the United States--when our embassies were bombed in Africa--when Americans died on the USS Cole. If Bush was President during this time the likelihood of a 9/11 would be much slimmer. The reason why the terrorists attacked us on 9-11 is because of the liberal attitude in this country--and the weak foreign policy of the former administration. When the attacks on Americans abroad were answered with words instead of action the terrorists learned that America isn't serious about defending itself. That it will do essentially nothing at all if we or our interests are being threatened. Such is the attitude of the United Nations. 

The liberals want America to bow to an inept league of nations--a United Nations with a Clinton/liberal attitude on terrorism: do nothing, say an earful. The United Nations had tough words to deal with Iraq, but no ammo. One resolution should have been enough: the cease-fire agreement. America learned what happens when words are not followed with consequences.

One resolution should have been sufficient: the cease-fire agreement. Once Iraq broke the agreement to get rid of its weapons of mass destruction and have on-going inspections to validate the elimination of the WMD we should have resumed conflict in Iraq. Instead we allowed an inept Secretary of State to go to the UN to negotiate with this league of nations to follow their own resolutions. How many resolutions does it take to get the UN to do something? And isn't it interesting that we have to ask permission from France, Germany, and Russia, nations who have oil agreements with the dictator, to defend America and democracy itself? Isn't it funny that we invested blood, sweat, and tears to rebuild France and Germany after World War 2--a totally selfless act by America and American taxpayers--to ensure that France and Germany are free? Our soverignty is determined by countries like Libya and China who hate America and everything it stands for? 

If any of these nine dwarfs really want to replace President Bush they should all denounce the UN and the terrorist appeasers. They should all thank President Bush for his leadership and offer a STRONGER way to deal with the terrorists. They should offer their own plan to deal with terrorism here and abroad. They should offer their own plan to deal with Iraq. I have one question: Where is the Democratic plan to make America safe? Answer: It is absent. Electing a Democrat to deal with national security is like empowering the environmentalist wackos to deal with an energy crisis. G-d bless President Bush and G-d bless America.
