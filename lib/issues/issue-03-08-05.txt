Headline: Drag racers need a legal venue in Miami
Author: Javier Ruiz / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
I'd like to congratulate the Florida Highway Patrol and Metro-Dade police on their most recent drag race sting operation. 

In performing this bust, they have accomplished a stunning feat: They made some 200 arrests - of car enthusiasts and their spectators - while accomplishing absolutely nothing.

How is that possible? Well, that takes a little understanding, and that's precisely where local law enforcement were deficient in their efforts: understanding.

What is lost in all the in the foaming-mouth journalism of local news outlets, and the predictable Hollywood oversimplification of movies such as "2 Fast 2 Furious," is that drag racing has evolved into a culture. That's something that isn't reflected in how police have chosen to handle the situation.

Just listen to them: "[These gatherings are] just an excuse for teenagers to come here to smoke pot, drink and go drag racing," Metro-Dade Officer Nancy Garcia, in a bold display of ignorance, said while breaking up a large gathering of car enthusiasts outside of a Denny's restaurant on the corner of Bird Road and 87th avenue. 

The cars who were chased from that lot moved on to the Checkers parking lot on the corner of Bird and 107th. After a brief stop there, one uniformed and one plainclothes officer arrived in a cruiser, speeding through the lot as recklessly as any teen, and shouting through the cruiser's megaphone, laughing hysterically, looking like cartoon characters fresh out of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 

It's a circus tour of sorts, where cops chase kids - one very much like the other - with neither rhyme nor reason, or any real concrete goal.

"It's not about enforcing the law," Eliu Guerra, certainly not a teen at the age of 28, said.

"It's more about 'we see a bunch of kids, we have to show them we're cops,'" he explained.

Miami's import scene is still in its infancy. It's not as matured as the scene out west, where lonely roads winding through the desert beg for the shriek of rubber on asphalt, grippy "summer" tires are the only tires you need, and performance parts arrive fresh from Japan via the Pacific ocean.

James Dean is still somewhere out on those California highways in a phantom Porsche, testament to how deep the roots of California street racing dig, and how pervasive and tenacious the appeal of the racing culture is.

So it's no surprise that the police out west know a thing or two about how to control street racing.

Take for example the Top the Cops program sponsored by the Santa Rosa Police Department. Every Wednesday, the Santa Rosa Police Department volunteers four to six stock police cars, and full uniformed officers to match, to race high school teens at Infineon Raceway an hour north of San Francisco. Cost? $17.

"[The kids] love it. We have kids 16-18 years old, both boys and girls ... The officers love it. The ones that are participating have a great time and they interact with the kids," Officer Kevin McKinnie, who put the program together seven years ago, and still coordinates it, said. 

The police department takes advantage of the interaction, which draws 100-150 high schoolers to the raceway every Wednesday between the months of April and October. They hand out flyers explaining the dangers and consequences of street racing. It also introduces young racers to a safe venue for their hobby in a controlled environment.

According to McKinnie, the program has served as a valuable public relations tool that has helped to "knock down that wall between kids and law enforcement."

"It's been very beneficial and we've heard lots of reports that kids are not drag racing ... out on the street ... in this age group," he added.

Not that police would have that option in Miami, where the closest track, Moroso Motorsports Park, is in West Palm Beach.

"The problem with Moroso," Guerra explained, "It's too far. It takes gas to go up, gas to come back, in between you have flat tires, things that could happen to your car. You just don't want to risk it."

And this is where police and lawmakers need to listen to and understand drag racers and car enthusiasts like Guerra: "All you need is a strip of land, away from the main city, somewhere in Homestead or wherever - a 10 or 15 minute drive, and just build a park, have cops police it or whatever you want to do, and charge us.  We'll pay, and we'll race all night," he suggests. "No matter what you do, you can't stop people from racing."

Subheadline: Former Golden Panther making impact in WUSA
Author: Harry Coleman/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Rewind to 2001. Ifeoma Dieke was an All-Sun Belt Conference selection and was one of the main reasons for FIU's 11-4-2 season.

Considered one of the  best soccer players to ever come through the FIU soccer program by head women's soccer coach Everton Edwards, many believed there was no doubt she would get drafted following her senior season in 2002. 

But obstacles arose, as Dieke was named ineligible to play due to a questioning of a grade she earned while attending school in her hometown of Scotland and missed all but one game of her senior season. 

She scored a goal in her lone start but went undrafted following the season.

"That took away from her being drafted," said  Edwards on the misfortune of Dieke missing most of the season. 

However, this did not stop Dieke from reaching the professional level of soccer and playing for the Women's United Soccer Association.

In March, she tried out for the Atlanta Beat and made the team after walking onto a preseason tryout. 

She switched her position from defense to an attacking midfielder. 

Dieke was astonished to have made the team.

"Just being in the 16 [the WUSA's team player limit] - I was speechless," Dieke said to Atlanta reporters at the time. "I couldn't believe it." 

And now, she has already made an impact in Atlanta. She has started eight of 13 games for the Beat who stands in first place in the WUSA with nine wins. 

Tom Stone, her coach in Atlanta, has welcomed the addition of Dieke to the team.

"[Ifeoma] was the surprise of the 2003 tryout. She is a great combination of athleticism and European sophistication," Stone said about the five-foot, seven- inch Dieke. 

"She can literally play anywhere on the field, but we plan on using her in the back line or at defensive midfield. Atlanta Beat fans are in for a treat," he added.

Edwards agrees, and is especially proud of Dieke considering the fact she barely played her senior year.

"Ifeoma is a different class of player, and I am proud in her confidence to make the team in Atlanta," said Edwards, who coached Dieke for three seasons at FIU.

Dieke finished her Golden Panther career with four goals playing in 44 games, 38 in which she started.  As a freshman in 1999, Dieke tied for first on the team with five assists and was named to the FIU/Doubletree Club Invitational All-Tournament Team.

Despite missing 12 games in 2000 and 13 in 2001 due to injuries, Dieke was named All-Sun Belt Conference both seasons.

Since making her pro debut, Scottish and Nigerian national team coaches have contacted Dieke about playing for their teams but she considers herself not ready to make any decisions as of yet.

"Atlanta has given me a chance, and I want to concentrate on my commitment to them," Dieke told The Atlanta Journal.

And now the city of Atlanta is getting a first hand look at one of FIU's finest, blossoming into one the WUSA's brightest young players.

Headline: Innocent or guilty? Only Kobe and accuser know the real truth
Author: Mike Hernandez/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While most Americans were at home celebrating our nation's birthday on July 4, Kobe Bryant was not.

Instead, the NBA superstar was back in Eagle, Colorado, a small resort town with 3,500 residents positioned in the Rocky Mountains. Bryant surrendered to Eagle County police after being accused of sexually assault by a 19-year old employee at the Vale Cascade Resort and Spa where he was staying after having surgery for an injury he sustained last season. 

The 24-year old, three-time world champion guard of the Los Angeles Lakers, spent about an hour in jail before posting a $25,000 bond. Even though there was an arrest warrant issued by County Judge Russell Granger, it was not immediately clear whether Bryant would be prosecuted. It was not until July 18 that District Attorney Mark Hurlbert made public his intentions to go forward with charges against Bryant. 

"It certainly is a possibility that he could go to prison on this," Hurlbert told ESPN when announcing the single felony charge his office brought against Bryant. "Given the seriousness of the crime, and given the type of crime, it's something the prosecutor does not get into lightly."

If convicted, Bryant could face anywhere from four years to life in prison and a $750,000 fine. 

So now we have this media mess. The reporters want more access. The lawyers want the records to continue to be sealed so that Bryant is assured of a fair trial. Rulings on the subject are still pending. The one certain thing that will come from all this is that life will never be the same for Bryant.

Before admitting to engaging in what he has said was consensual sex, Bryant had the type of life anyone would want. At just 18 years of age, he was a rookie playing at the world's highest level of professional basketball. At 22, he won his first world title. His team would go on to win two more before falling just this past season in their quest for a fourth consecutive championship. He had the shoe contract with Adidas, a mansion made up of more rooms than necessary and a beautiful wife who just bore their first child seven months ago. 

But even with all this, Bryant still made a mistake. 

He says he is guilty of adultery and was very apologetic about it, but said he was innocent of assaulting the accuser. 

But even if the  case against him results in an acquittal, Bryant will never be the same. 

"I am disgusted with myself," were words Bryant used at a press conference with his wife Vanessa at his side where he attempted to give his side of the story. 

Shortly after, Bryant purchased a $4 million ring for his wife. Interesting to say the least.

Although we have this picture of Bryant being a model athlete - the alternative to the trash-talking, often-arrested professional we have come to read about -  speaking Italian, reading poetry and conducting himself with class both on and off the court, Bryant is also a man - a very rich man who probably gets what he wants most of the time.

We can make the argument that the woman, whose identity has remained concealed with the exception of a picture in a California tabloid, knew what she was getting into when she went up to Bryant's room. 

We could also make the case how she acted in an unprofessional manner and say that since she was recently recovering from a drug overdose over a failed relationship, she is just a lying person who seeks public attention. 

After all, this is Kobe Bryant who she is accusing and if I'm not mistaken, she did tryout and just miss a chance at American Idol, right?

But as much as the public wants to believe that Bryant is innocent, we must remember that we don't really know the real Kobe Bryant. When was the last time you sat down and had a beer with Kobe? Visited his house? Played a game of one-on-one with him?

Keith Jackson, a veteran reporter for ESPN's Page 2 who has covered several major sporting events such as the Super Bowl and has interviewed the "eloquent" Bryant on at least one occasion, said it best when he wrote, "I don't know how he treats his family when they're behind closed doors. I don't know what he might be capable of when no one is around." 

Added Jackson: "District Attorney Mark Hurlbert wouldn't put his career on the line if he didn't have a case. Remember, we thought we knew Kirby Puckett, O.J. Simpson and Bill Clinton." 

In the end, I personally hope that this is a misunderstanding. It may be selfish of me, but you can't help but admire Kobe. 

Like I said, he is the alternative to the "professionals" such as Randy Moss who we saw being taken to jail after dragging a police officer on the hood of his car. 

However, if Kobe is guilty of this crime, I want him to be treated the same way any other violator of the law would be. It's unfortunate, but just because you are in the public eye, doesn't mean you are immune to punishment. 

But until proven otherwise, Bryant is innocent.

Bryant has to report back to Eagle County Court on Aug. 6, and the battle will continue, or some may say, is just beginning. 

"When everything comes clean, it will all be fine, you'll see," Bryant told The Los Angeles Times. 

That is a claim that is truly in jeopardy.

Headline: Rubin to replace Carter as new track and field coach
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU athletic director Rick Mello announced the hiring of Stephen Rubin as the new track and field coach on August 1.

He replaces former coach Jessica Carter, who resigned after season's end.

Rubin comes from Washington University in St. Louis, where he served as head coach.

Rubin produced eight All-Americans and 22 qualifying athletes for the NCAA Championships while at Washington University. The men's and women's teams both produced top 25 finishes there last season as well.

The Washington University women's track team also posted the school's first-ever University Athletic Association Conference Triple Crown in cross county, indoor and outdoor track.

Rubin has ties to the South Florida area after serving as the assistant track and field coach at the University of Miami for nine years. He also served as the recruiting coordinator at UM and is said to have solid connections throughout Florida.

"Stephen Rubin brings two things to the table. One is that he has great familiarity with the area. Second, as a young coach, he has taken every step to prepare himself and has sacrificed leaving Division I in order to get head coaching experience, which is very important," Mello said.

Mello believes Rubin is exactly what FIU track and field needs to become  successful.

Added Mello: "He's going to take us to the next level."

Headline: Football hires new play-by-play announcer for upcoming season
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU football named long-time network play-by-play  announcer Phil Schoen as its new play-by-play announcer for the 2003 season last week.

Schoen will replace Bill Zimpher, who served as FIU's play-by-play announcer last season.

Zimpher, who resides in Pennsylvania, decided to leave FIU so he could forgo his weekly journey from Pennsylvania to Miami, in order to spend more time with his family.

Schoen is now looking forward to taking over where Zimpher left off.

"I've known Bill for a long time, since he worked at Penn State, and I think he's one of the best announcers in the game," Schoen said. "It's an honor to take over the microphone from someone I respect so much."

Zimpher, worked as the play-by-play announcer at Penn State before becoming the play-by-play announcer for the Miami Dolphins prior to FIU.

Schoen brings an impressive track record with him as well.

He began his career in the late 1980's as a basketball and football announcer at Rutgers University, and then served as the football announcer for his alma mater Bowling Green from 1990-91.

But recently, Schoen has focused most of his attention on soccer. He served as the primary soccer announcer on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 from 1996 through 2001. He worked the World Cup, MLS, U.S. Cup, Champions League and NCAA Finals.

Most recently, he has been an announcer and producer at Gol TV, hosting news programming and serving as primary play-by-play announcer for the network's coverage of international games and league matches, including Italy's prestigious Serie A.

In July 2000, TheSportingNews.com called him, "the best English-language play-by-play man in the country."

But now, Schoen says he is ready to take on college football as his next obstacle.

"I'm really looking forward to the upcoming season," Schoen said. 

"There is something special about the passion that surrounds college football and I want to convey that emotion to every Golden Panther fan that tunes in."

Schoen began working in Miami for Sports Radio 560 WQAM in 1992, and stayed there until 1998, working as a host for a variety of sports shows, and anchoring pre- and post-game shows for the Marlins, Heat, and Panthers.

He also worked for Sunshine Network and SportsChannel Florida, including coverage of FIU basketball and soccer.

And Schoen, who grew up in Miami and graduated from North Miami Beach Senior High in 1981, hopes his familiarity with the area will help him with his new gig.

"Having grown up in South Florida, I know where FIU has come from and where it wants to go," Schoen said. 

"This is a big responsibility, but it's an enjoyable one as well," Schoen added.

Athletic Director Rick Mello is excited about the hiring of Schoen as well.

"We were very lucky to get someone of Phil's caliber. He is well known in the South Florida market," Mello said.

Added Mello: "He has familiarity with the university and knows what we're trying to build here."

 Schoen makes his FIU debut on Saturday, Sept. 6 when the Golden Panthers travel to Terre Haute, Ind. for a road contest against Indiana State.

Headline: Mello: "There will never be beer sales inside the [football] stadium"
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Questions concerning the possible sale of alcohol at football games were shut down with athletic director Rick Mello responding: "there will never be beer sales inside the stadium."

FIU does not sell beer or any other alcoholic beverages at football games, but Mello says they have considered possibly allowing beer consumption outside the stadium on game days.

"The only thing that has been even considered would be outside the stadium in a tailgate situation," Mello said.

Students have expressed their feelings on the subject, with the majority in favor of beer sales at football games.

Said senior Nick Trifonov: "I think they should allow it, because I think it would give an increase in revenue for the whole school, and it would increase attendance, especially by college students."

Senior Jorge Bustamante agreed, saying football games and beer go hand and hand.

"It should be legal. They would make more money for the football team and it would make games more fun for the students," Bustamante said. "You need beer at football games."

Mello says that although the alcohol policy is strictly enforced, people are allowed to tailgate in their own privacy.

"People are allowed open tailgating and it is closely monitored, but as long as people are responsible, it isn't a problem," Mello said. 

But FIU is not alone in its alcohol policies.

In fact, football teams who play their home games on campus will rarely ever have beer sales inside the stadium.

This same policy applies to state schools such as UF and FSU, who do not sell beer at home games.

UM, on the other hand, does sell beer, but that has a lot to do with the fact that the games are played off campus in the Orange Bowl, located near downtown.

But UM has had problems with beer sales of late. Behavior at the Orange Bowl has become rowdy in recent years, with officials banning beer sales at halftime starting this season as an effort to crack down.

Fans throwing beer bottles, fights, and profanity are common entities on Saturdays in the Orange Bowl.

Most schools who host games on campus seem to understand that although it would definitely increase attendance and generate revenue, selling beer to thousands of college students has its downfalls, especially when about half the student population is under the legal drinking age.

But as for now, the current alcohol policy at FIU will remain intact, with the possibility of a "tailgate beer consumption" situation possible for next season.

Headline: Duck infestation wreaks havoc on FIU campus
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
They walk the halls of University Park distracting visitors, crapping on the sidewalk, and intimidating anyone daring enough to ignore their presence. I'm talking about the feathered fiends - the ducks. 

For years these germ-infested birds have roamed the hallways of FIU like they own the place. They might as well own the place considering you can't even "nudge" them out of the way. If you dare step, touch, harass, poke, prod, or look at them, a fine will be issued immediately. You would think the damn things laid golden eggs with all of the fuss made about them. 

I assume this issue of not touching the ducks has to do with preserving its natural environment. Its natural habitat including of course, paved sidewalks full of college students, blue benches for their enjoyment, and the local Starbucks only a few waddles away.  I'm sure they also appreciate thousands of students stepping on their habitat. Man, this must be paradise to the ducks.

Although the ducks may see me as a walking meal ticket, I see the ducks as nuisances that only seem to wreak havoc in our hallways. Let's face it folks, all they do is beg for food, crap on the sidewalks and attack. Yes, they do attack! I, for one, have been the victim of one duck's wrath. 

I was sitting on a bench under the Green Library casually waiting for class to start. I decided I was a tad hungry and fancied a Rice Krispie Treat. There were ducks around but by no means was this a scene from "The Birds." Then I noticed there was one duck approaching rather quickly. He stood before me and quacked. 

I knew he wanted my treat but dammit, it was mine! As soon as I ignored his unjust request, he went into an angry rage. He proceeded to flap his wings and fly on me. He tried to attack me and snatch my precious treat away from me. I pushed him off and saw the gawking faces of students who witnessed my struggle. I did lose my tasty treat but gained some scratches as battle scars. My dignity was this volatile animal's biggest victim. 

Sound quacky (pardon the pun)? Well it could happen to a little child or any defenseless passerby. Ducks likes most animals adapt to their surroundings. By keeping them in a hectic environment, they become hectic also. Plus, giving them food only encourages duck attacks. Sure, I thought they were cute at first just like everyone else, but they aren't caged zoo animals or trained circus animals, they are wild ducks.

 Given, they were probably here first but, we already built over most of their habitat the least we could do is give them a better place to stay. UP is nowhere near a natural wildlife habitat. There is no reason why animals should be roaming the hallways. 

Relocating the ducks benefits both them and us. We can finally roam the hallways free of bird crap and animal harassment, and they can live without reckless twenty-somethings destroying their habitat. I am not anti-duck, but I don't think we can live harmoniously in a university environment with these creatures. So, either stop the maleficent mallards, or make UP a duck sanctuary rather than a college campus.

Headline: Malpractice insurance debate causes patient controversy
Author: Lawrence C. Levy/ Newsday
&nbsp;
At the hospital where my 86-year-old mother is having a fractured hip repaired, doctors say they don't deliver babies anymore. 

The reason? Reflecting a national trend, the obstetricians couldn't get affordable malpractice insurance and neither they nor the hospital would risk the financial exposure of a big, losing lawsuit. 

"This isn't just a problem for doctors and hospitals," Dr. Eugene Eisman said the other night as he made his rounds at Aventura Hospital in Dade County, Fla., where he once served on a panel of doctors and lawyers to find a faster and fairer way to resolve claims. "It's a problem for patients who have fewer and fewer choices for care."

It's also a complex problem for politicians. And under pressure from lobbyists for lawyers and the insurance and health-care industries, which see billions of dollars at stake, swallowing the wrong cure could be as damaging as the disease itself. 

Tentative steps in New York toward limiting damages for pain and suffering went nowhere this legislative session, despite increased concerns from doctors. 

But for once, the swamp of dysfunction that routinely slows progress in New York actually worked for the public good. When it comes to malpractice ``reform,'' the slower the better. 

The wrong political decisions could leave tens of thousands of people without a fair chance to be compensated for unnecessary suffering and it could remove a strong incentive from increasingly large health-care providers - the risk of public embarrassment and huge losses - to be as careful as possible with their patients. 

But doing nothing may also hurt patients by shrinking the number of doctors willing to take high-risk cases and helping drive up the overall cost of care. 

I don't pretend to know definitively the reason or reasons for rising malpractice costs. After wading into the issue on and off for several months, I'm not sure anybody can know for certain. If they say they do - that it's only ``unreasonably'' high awards from manipulated ``runaway'' juries or only a rise in ``bad'' cost-conscious care or ``exploitative'' insurance companies looking to make up for lower recent returns on their own investments - then you can be sure their positions are based as much on fervor as fact. 

My gut tells me that the conservative trophy of capping awards for pain and suffering would do more to deny the average person a chance to get a good lawyer to take their case - as lawyers get a percentage of any settlement - than it would hold down insurance premiums. Caps sought by insurers, hospitals and health-care professionals haven't been particularly effective in California. 

But I also can't say that the more liberal posture of the consumer and trial-lawyer lobbies - that it's all the fault of profiteering corporations and cavalier providers--is a fair assessment of a real crisis in nearly half the states. And doing nothing or making it easier to sue for unlimited damages isn't an answer. 

In Florida, which has some of the nation's highest premiums, a funny thing happened on the way to legislation. Republicans in control of both houses were moving toward imposing a $250,000 cap on verdicts for pain and suffering about as fast as a triage nurse in an emergency room. But after five months of hearings, neither witnesses nor studies could confirm that high jury awards were the culprit. (Some data suggest awards aren't all that much higher.) So some reasonably cautious GOP lawmakers balked. 

The problem, however, is that there is still a problem. 

Dr. Eisman at Aventura Hospital understands that capping awards could make it harder for many to get a fair hearing of their claims and perhaps easier for hospitals and professionals to get away with poor care. But he also knows that the fear of being sued and the costs of protecting oneself has limited his ability to do his job. He says he has kept his premiums very low by no longer performing most invasive procedures. 

Somehow a way must be found to protect patients, such as my mother, if she should be the victim of bad medical decisions, and allow doctors such as him to care for her as his expertise, experience and values dictate. But the worst thing would be for politicians to quickly swallow at a single miracle cure.

Headline: Editorial: Enrollment cap may be  necessary measure
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The State University Presidents Association met July 15 to discuss the potential capping of enrollment at Florida's state universities, an unpleasant but plausible solution to the funding shortfall administrators are facing.

At FIU, a series of cuts have made life very hard for students, faculty, and administration alike. Most recently, administrators were asked to do without more than $11 million. Of that, $7.4 million was enrollment growth funding - money given to universities to fund increased enrollment - which was not funded by the state at all. 

The answer at this campus was to sacrifice class offerings and other student services, and to increase tuition to offset some of the cuts.

But those solutions have come only part-way.

The reality is this: present funding leaves universities no room to grow. FIU simply cannot maintain the quality of its education as is, let alone with increasing enrollment. Either it will have to further reduce quality and increase tuition, or it will have to allow fewer students to enroll.

Reducing quality and again increasing tuition is not an option. This institution cannot afford to tarnish its hard-earned reputation for a value-minded, quality education. Nor can it afford to stress the pocketbooks of overburdened students. The only viable cure is to cap enrollment.  

The medicine, capping enrollment, is bitter. It is bitter for a community that benefits from an educated workforce, for students that seek an education that might better their lives, for a faculty who are employed to disseminate that education, and for administrators entrusted to ensure that a quality education is provided to the community. It is bitter, but it may be necessary.

If enrollment is capped, the university system must see to it that current students progress toward graduation with as few unnecessary boundaries as possible. Required classes oft-criticized for their questionable value, such as First Year Experience, impede that progression, wasting students' time and absorbing resources that might be better applied elsewhere. 

Exit exams such as the CLAST, redundant in nature, inhibit that progression as well. If a student has passed his core classes, and has the grades to prove it, and if an institution trusts the professors it hires, then it should follow that no exam is necessary to prove that students are properly instructed.

When resources are limited, efficiency is the name of the game.

Headline: A race to the finish
Subheadline: Miami nightlife uncovers a variety of street racers
Author: Alejandra Diaz /  Managing Editor
&nbsp;
As the city sleeps, a once vacant parking lot is transformed into a living, breathing plethora of rip-roaring, vibrating, muffler-flaring racing cars--customized to outrace, outlast and smoke the competition. On Tuesday and Thursday nights, many South Floridians, including FIU students take their cars to the streets.  Loaded with supercharged engines, Nitrous Oxide and high performance custom improvements, they infuse the night with the urban sounds of a growing sub car culture. 

These mechanically and electronically enhanced racing cars are modified to help street racers succumb to the allures of an often-deadly "sport." Rushing at speeds of over 80 miles per hour, racers seem to play a high stakes game of Russian roulette with local law enforcement officers. 

"Street racing is a big problem ... [and] with movies that idolize it, kids don't realize the carnage that is involved in a car accident," Officer Adam Shahan of the Miami-Dade County Police Department said. "Your body can't take an 80 mile [per hour] accident into a tree, a solid object or another car while your racing." 

In 2002, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported that numbers totaled as high as 375 teenage deaths due to fatal motor vehicle crashes.  In 2001, the national costs of speeding-related crashes were estimated to be $40.4 billion - that is equivalent to $76,865 per minute or $1,281 per second.

As reported in The Miami Herald and other local newspapers, several recent deaths due to street racing have begun to raise eyebrows. On June 13, the 17-year-old son of a South Florida police officer was killed after racing and crashing his Corvette into a concrete pole.  

A couple of weeks later, an alleged street racer claimed the life of a local man who was reported dead after being trapped in his box truck when it burst into flames. 

The National Center for Health Statistics reports that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15 to 20-year-olds based on 1998 figures. 

According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 5,582 teenagers died in motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2001. IIHS also reported that in 2001, the highest motor vehicle death rate was among 20 to 24-year-olds.

The number of accidents due to street racing has many Floridians questioning the adequacy of Florida laws.

"Part of the problem is that laws let 16-year-olds drive. Parents are also giving kids cars that they can't handle, without giving them the right education," said Lou Romero, co-founder of Autobahn Touring, a group of German car enthusiasts. 

Complaints of weak laws have led to recent changes of toughened laws targeting illegal street racing. 

A law past last year makes street racing a misdemeanor instead of a moving violation. First-time street-racing offenders face a $250 to $500 fine and the loss of their licenses for a year. Repeat offenders face a $1,000 fine and a two-year suspension of their licenses.

In one night, local car enthusiasts will travel as much as 15 miles: eluding police officers and becoming a nuisance to local businesses. First gathering on Bird Road's Tropical Park, German car fans meet to share tips and fix up their cars. 

"We meet here [at the park] because it's a chance for us to work on our cars and hang out with each other," Christian Brocca, a junior, architecture major, said.

After a routine check by local law enforcement officers, car enthusiasts re-gather with an unorganized group of show car owners on Bird Road and 87th avenue. 

With thundering bass, custom paint jobs and impressive displays of hydraulic equipment, cars line the parking lot in what appears to be a scene out of this summer's blockbuster movie, "2 Fast 2 Furious." 

Sometimes the cars number in the hundreds and most of their owners are in their late teens and early 20s. Gathering in different locations throughout the area, local businesses complain that the gatherings intimidate customers.

"We have to give a lot of credit [for late movies] because the older customers are afraid to come in," Carolina Benito, assistant manager of the Blockbuster Video located on Bird Road and 107th avenue, said. 

Attempting to unravel the scene, police officers repeatedly tell the group to get in their cars and go home. But to no avail; police officers are forced to issue tickets for loitering or for modifying certain car parts to reach higher speeds. 

"[These gatherings are] just an excuse for teenagers to come here to smoke pot, drink and go drag racing," commented Officer Nancy Garcia of the Miami-Dade County Police Department. 

Although local businesses and police officers find these car groups annoying and sometimes exasperating, car owners say they find no other outlet in which to display their passion for cars.

"The areas available for racing are very limited, so I created a website which will hopefully help us get a place of our own," Steve Reed, a 25-year-old and member of SouthFloridaRacing.com, said.  "A place where we can get together, work on cars and race safely." 

While car enthusiasts hope for new locations to race, police officers blame county officials for the lack of racing locations available for students and racers to gather.  

"The higher-ups haven't built enough locations for kids to race; local areas are much too far for kids to go to," Shahan said.

Although South Florida continues to struggle with the dangers of street racing, several areas throughout the country have attempted to remedy the problem.

Cities in San Diego have changed their laws to target racers and spectators alike.  According to the North County Times, officials are responding to an increase in street racing related deaths by promoting legal racing events and charging street racing spectators with a misdemeanor.  	

The National Hot Rod Association is also taking proactive measures by sponsoring amateur drag racing at raceways in Southern California, according to South Coast Today.  Racing an average of 1,000 cars a day, this association hopes to lower the amount of deaths due to street racing.

According to the Los Angeles Times, police officers in Sonoma, California, are trying to get racers off the streets by offering them a chance to race against uniformed officers in their own squad cars on a quarter-mile strip at a local California speedway. 

They have also tried to battle the trend by passing laws to confiscate cars caught street racing. Spectators of illegal racing face $1,000 fines and six months in jail.  

In the last decade, more than 68,000 teenagers have died in auto crashes, according to the Insurance Group for Highway Safety.

 The number of fatal crashes nationwide attributed to street racing rose to 135 in 2002, from 72 the year before. 

Nationwide statistics show that 49 people are injured for every 1,000 who participate in illegal street racing.

Even though illegal and sometimes dangerous, the fast-paced world of cars, racing and the lack of existing racing spots have some on the hunt for the perfect adrenaline rush. 

According to Scott Selent, a sophomore, biology major at FIU, most street races last only a few seconds but are done mostly for the rush. 

Most street races are random and begin when people challenge each other by nodding their heads or riveting the motor, Selent added. Despite the risk, some FIU student street racers push every boundary of the law and race for the respect and awe of winning. 

"I don't make an appointment to race, but if [the opportunity arises] in the street, I sometimes race," Christian Brocca, a junior, architecture major, said. "It all depends on the conditions though. As you get older, you just forget about racing as much."

Even though local residents and FIU students continually gather and sometimes race, Miami-Dade County police officials say that regardless of the inadequacy of Florida laws, the problem exceeds the department's capacity to control it.

"There isn't much you can do. I don't think that [police] have the manpower to cover an area that is as big as 50 square miles," Shahan said. "On a Friday or Saturday night, squads receive 17 calls a night; they don't have a chance to answer each one."

The university police department feels confident that the University Park Campus and Biscayne Bay Campus are safe from street racers. 

"On campus we don't have this type of racing. The speed bumps located throughout campus are designed to slow people down," Capt. Jesse P. Scott of the University Police Department, said.  "This campus is not a conducive atmosphere for racing...we haven't had any significant problems with racing on campus." 

In an effort to protect students on and off campus, the university police department also partners with local jurisdictions and makes sure that they are on patrol at the appropriate times to combat street racing.

"Kids shouldn't race...the main problem is that parents just want to make their kids happy and they don't realize they are giving their kid a loaded gun-a 3,000 pound car capable of speeds over 140 mph," Shahan said.

Headline: Judo students to compete in world championship in Korea
Author: Lisa Cawley / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
Senior and first-degree black belt Shawn Blakey throws, pins, and chokes competitors more than 16 hours a week.  He is preparing to compete in the World University Games in Daegu, Korea this month along with three of his teammates from the FIU Judo Team.

Students Blakey, Katherine Vasquez, Raul Cruz and FIU Judo Club President Siri Traveiso, were selected to compete in this international competition as part of the U.S. collegiate team.  Their sensei, Nestor Bustillo, will be the head coach.

"It's an honor to be able to represent the United States and FIU at a world event such as this," Bustillo said.

The team, which includes seven students from other universities in addition to those from FIU, is set to leave Aug. 18 and return Sept. 2. The actual competition will last about a week. Team members are looking forward to the competition.

"I'm excited," Blakey said. "It's a really big competition.  It's definitely a little nerve-wracking, but it should be really cool."

To qualify for the U.S. collegiate team, students have to attain points from competing in regional and national competitions.  Those  who accumulate the most points in the nation are given the first opportunities to bid for a spot on the team. In addition, team members must be U.S. citizens between the ages of 17 and 28.

The estimated cost of the trip is about $2,500 per person, which amounts to about $12,500 that the FIU Judo Club, which is self-funded, has to finance. Some of the cost will be covered with revenue from the Judo summer camp and private donations, but a large part of the burden will fall on the individuals participating in the WUG, according to Bustillo.

The womens' Judo team has won first place in the Eastern Collegiates for the past three years and the men's team won third place this year, but this is the first time FIU Judo will be represented in a competition of this magnitude. And Bustillo said although he has confidence in the team, they have not had as much experience as some students from other countries, which may put them at a disadvantage.

""It's a very tough competition because at a collegiate level in Europe and Asia, all of these people have Judo programs in the school system from elementary; so we're at an enormous disadvantage," Bustillo said. 

The competition will be especially challenging because most FIU team members did not start practicing Judo until they reached FIU, according to Bustillo.

"They've managed to do very well on a competitive level, but you can't compare years of experience to having great heart," Bustillo added.

 Still, team members are resolute.

"I know the competition is fierce, but we have been training hard and I hope that will show," said Vasquez, a junior who has been practicing Judo for two years and is currently is a brown belt.  

Vasquez practices more than most: about five to six hours everyday. She once broke her clavicle while competing in a national competition, but said that she used the injury as motivation to improve.

"[The injury] was just a reason for me to keep going," she said. "After that, I trained even harder."

Blakey, who has been practicing Judo for five years, has also had his share of battle scars, but for him, it's just a part of the game.

"When you train as much as I do, you tend to get hurt on occasion, but the injuries are minor compared to other sports that I've played," Blakey said.

Bustillo, who has been teaching Judo at FIU since the program started in 1994, confirmed that injuries are rare, and when they do occur, they are usually minor.

He encourages everyone to practice Judo for self-discipline and social skills.

"A lot of people, because of the computer, are social morons," Bustillo said. "Their ability to interact with other people is very limited unless there is a computer between them. In Judo, you really have to be real with people. It's either you're there or you're not there. And I think it brings a sincerity in dealing with people."

The Judo team is not currently a part of the FIU Department of Athletics, but Bustillo said he is actively seeking emerging sport status for women's Judo from the NCAA.  Before it can be considered a sport, they need to collect 10 letters of support from supporting NCAA programs. So far, they have collected four, including one from FIU President Modesto Maidique. Bustillo expects the women's team to achieve sport status before the men's team because of Title IX - legislation that ensures gender equity in collegiate athletics.

Headline: Officer recognized for service and demeanor
Author: Angela Castillo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In addition to being named Officer of the Year for 2001-2002 and 2002-2003, Officer Wiltamar Mendes of the University Police Department was most recently selected as the Customer Service Employee of the Month this June.  Mendes is happy for the recognition and proud of the duties he carries out. 

"It feels just great to be recognized for one's hard work," Mendes said. "But it feels better when you know that your job is simply to help people and make a difference by doing so." 

 Mendes has been working at the FIU Police Department for the past four years. Under his title of Field Training Officer, he is responsible for training incoming officers to provide good service to the university community. In addition, Mendes is involved with the Community Service Committee of the Public Safety Department, which has adopted a Community-Oriented Policing that has shaped Officer Mendes' willingness to help.

"[Mendes] has a demeanor of service," Capt. Jesse P. Scott of the University Police Department said. "From the moment you look at him, you know that he is here to serve the community. Mendes is the kind of person that whenever you ask him to do something, it's done before you can even finish the sentence."

"I've personally noticed he is the first one to assist when a student gets a flat tire, needs a jump start, or needs to recharge his battery because of leaving their lights on," Campbell added  "He is so deserving of that monthly and annual award to the best employee."

His daughter Bianca Mendes agrees that Mendes makes significant contributions.

"My dad is very enthusiastic about his work, and I think that is because he is happy with what he does. When I used to work for the [FIU] Parking and Traffic department, everyone used to tell how good worker, and how helpful my dad is, and I think everyone appreciates his work a lot," Bianca Mendes said.

Mendes became interested in the field of law enforcement after he interviewed prisoners, mostly drug users, for a program called Treatment as an Alternative to Street Crime. This program, later renamed Pre-Trial Services, was supervised by the Probation Department in Oakland, California, and focused on putting offenders in drug treatment in order for them to rehabilitate, instead of making them serve time in jail. Mendes also worked as a prison director in his native Brazil where he helped to build the first penitentiary of the Rondonia State located in the Amazon region. And before joining the FIU Police Department, Mendes worked as a Metro-Dade police officer.  Mendes has not only attained experience in the field of law enforcement, but he has also gained experience in life while traveling and meeting different people from different places. And his co-workers admire his work ethic.

"Officer Mendes is a very well-rounded man," Lieutenant Peter Canino of the University Police Department, said. "He has gone through life learning so many things that I believe that's the clue for the nice interaction he always has with people. He is always taking action on his own, and his work is in one word, outstanding."

"Officer Mendes is such a very good employee," Corporal Pennie Ochipa said.  "He is very hard working and is always volunteering to do a lot of things most officers don't like to deal with. We can always count on him, he is very dependable." 

Among Mendes' goals are moving up the ranks of the police department and attending school because he believes that there is always a need to learn.

"I would like to grow up and became a sergeant or a lieutenant, I've always liked studying, so I may ... attend law school," he said.

Mendes came to the United States when he was 17-years-old. He earned a bachelor's degree in acting, and has also earned his master's degree in Public Administration at California State University.

Headline: Search for SJMC dean continues
Author: Francisco Zúniga / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As the search for a new dean for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication continues, Lillian Kopenhaver was promoted to Interim Dean until the Search and Screen Committee finds a permanent replacement. 

 Kopenhaver has served as Associate Dean of the SJMC since 1991. She was second to SJMC dean Arthur Heise, and she has also served as chair of the Journalism Department. She replaced Heise, who stepped down as dean on June 30, and she took the interim position on July 1.  

 Kopenhaver was chosen by the provost to take on the role of interim dean.

"The provost asked me to take the position on while we recruit for a dean," said Kopenhaver.

He asked her to fill the position because of her credentials and experience in the SJMC, and believes her to be the most qualified person for the position in this transitional period.   

 "She understands the direction that the school is taking, she understands its commitment to quality. She has the recognition and the credibility with faculty to provide the leadership that is necessary," said Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of academic affairs .

 The search for a new Dean began last year in the spring while Heise was still in office, but had little results. With several less-than-optimal candidates in mind, the Search and Screen Committee ultimately decided to drop them and put off the search for the time being.

 "We didn't get the candidates that we had hoped to get," said Rosenberg, also adding, "Searches are always very tricky and we did have a number of highly qualified candidates. But we felt that we just didn't get the right candidates for the position of our deanship here at FIU". 

 Mike Mqueen, associate professor, chairperson of the Journalism and Broadcasting Department, and member of the Search and Screen Committee, explained that each of the qualified candidates had a problem that raised concerns. He also explained that finding a dean is difficult and time consuming. 

 "It's always tough to find a dean of a school. The pool of candidates exists out of about a hundred other deans from around the country. In other words, there are only one hundred people like the one you're looking for around the entire country," said Mcqueen, also adding, "When you have a professional school you always want somebody who's spent at least ten to fifteen years in the profession, as well as having some incredible academic credentials, sometimes as much as a PHD". 

 The selection process itself includes a number of meetings with its members, advertising of the open position, and a national search for the right candidate. The committee determines the criteria and qualifications that the candidate should possess.  As the search is begun, the committee sends out flyers and makes phone calls in order to identify candidates for the position. This process takes three to six months according to Rosenberg.

 When the committee receives the resumes, it takes all the applications and reviews each one. Then they come up with a number of viable candidates.

 After all the references are checked, those candidates are contacted to see whether or not they remain interested, explained Rosenberg.

Led by Dr. Joyce Elam, Dean of the College of Business, the Search and Screen Committee plans to start the process again in the fall. The search is expected to last about a year before a new dean for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication is selected.

Headline: Selection of concerts lacking in South Florida
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Ah yes, summer is nearly over. In about three weeks, we'll all attend those dreadful first days of class and decide which ones to drop. 

This summer was, generally speaking, pretty good. However, there was something I found kind of lacking. Something was missing this summer, and I found it kind of disappointing.  

One thing I usually get excited for each summer is a great line-up of concerts. Summer concerts are usually supposed to be great! 

All the good bands are on tour, school's out, and if one particularly good band doesn't happen to come to your town you can just road trip to the nearest tour stop. 

That wasn't really the case this summer though, at least not for me. The line-up of concerts and shows coming to South Florida this summer was, well...weak. 

The only good bands that came ended up being not so good, I missed the concerts I had been looking forward to because I was out of town and then in the hospital for five days, and the really amazing shows were out of town. It was a joke, looking back on this summer, I can't believe how lame of a concert season it was. Lets start back in May. The Alkaline Trio and Pretty Girls Make Graves kicked off the season. It was one of the few I attended, and it was a good show more or less, but the Alkaline Trio is just starting to lose its charisma. 

Too many little kids and people who know absolutely nothing about music are showing up to these kind of shows and it makes me sick. Plus, Pretty Girls Make Graves, who were amazing, were only given 15 minutes, which pissed me off. They deserved more time than Alkaline Trio.

June would have been an awesome month for music. Right away on June 2nd was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snoop Dog, and more importantly, openers The Mars Volta. 

Luckily, I didn't attend and neither did The Mars Volta, which was the only reason I ever wanted to go. Unfortunately, the band was dealing with the death of a friend and sound technician. 

That was kind of a let-down, but no worries, I was lucky enough to attend the Field Day Music Festival in  New York, only a few days later. 

What an amazing show that could have been. Radiohead, Sigor Rós, The Roots, Beck and a ton of other amazing bands. Unfortunately, tragedy struck the Field Day festival, and it was turned into a "Giants Stadium" festival where almost half of the bands scheduled to play dropped out and rain poured down on the crowd all day. 

It was a disappointment and a waste of a road trip.

It seems like the only real worthy show in the month of June was the Longwave performance at Churchill's. Did I see that show? No! I was stuck in a meeting and couldn't make it on time. Don't I have the greatest luck?

The next concert I was really excited for was in the month of July. Sure, I'd have to make a little trip to Orlando, but it was for a wonderful cause. 

The Dismemberment Plan, probably my favorite rock band, was making their Florida rounds as part of their final tour. The guys have decided to break up after several years of making incredible music. 

Was I able to see this once in a lifetime opportunity event? Nope, instead I was studying abroad in Europe with FIU. Now some may call me selfish or stupid, but if only I would have known about this show ahead of time, I would have cancelled my trip to Europe. 

I missed a show that has been described to me as the best show anyone has ever seen. I've been told the band basically took requests for half of the show. I wanted to cry. 

The only other shows left in the month of July were Reel Big Fish, the Rx Bandits and the annual summer Warped Tour. For all three of these shows, I was sick in bed and in the hospital. I missed them all, and have never felt so unlucky in my entire life.

Now summer is over, and there are practically no concerts left. Lollapalooza is today but it doesn't look too exciting, with only a few bands I'd be slightly interested in seeing. 

Then there's the Reggie and the Full Effect show on the 12 and the My Hotel Year show on the 15. I guess those will be fun.

 I wonder if it is simply my bad luck sometimes, or if South Florida is just an awful place for concerts and shows. With such great bands like Belle and Sebastian, Modest Mouse, Hot Hot Heat and Kaito on tour this summer, I tend to think it's Florida's fault when they don't make their way down here. 

I don't really feel that there's much of a market for such top-quality, exciting music. Every once in a while there's a concert or two that catches my eye but lets face it, Miami is no New York City.

Not to worry though, this fall has a pretty promising lineup of good concerts, which you can find a preview for in  the first fall issue of The Beacon. Maybe I'll actually attend some of them this time.

Straight from the horse's mouth: "Seabiscuit" is the best movie this summer. 

It has succeeded tremendously in portraying a heart wrenching, uplifting and sincere real-life drama without a cheesy love story or exaggerated action. 

Set during the bleak depression era, "Seabiscuit," based on the biography by Laura Hillenbrand, revolves around  the titular race horse who has very little chance of winning anything and a jockey with an even smaller chance of survival. 

An American Legend, the film is very true to the story. 

I had the pleasure of reading the book before the movie was released and I have to say I'm very proud of filmmaker Gary Ross ("Pleasantville") for creating one of the few book-to-movie films that intelligently added and omitted scenes to the actual plot. 

The three main people in Seabiscuit's real life were wonderfully portrayed by Tobey Maguire as the troubled jockey, Johnny "Red" Pollard, Jeff Bridges as wealthy owner Charles Howard, and Chris Cooper as the introverted trainer, Tom Smith. 

Still, the real scene stealer was William H. Macy, with the highly entertaining radio character and commentator, Tick-Tock McClaughlin always coming in at exactly the right time to improve the often-times somber mood in the film. 

The movie is well-paced at two hours and 30 minutes, leaving a lot of time to soak in the exhilarating race scenes. 

Cameras are strategically placed during the horse race filming so that the audience can almost feel the pulsing, streamlined  galloping bodies of a thoroughbred beneath them rather than the cold and creaky, bubble gum besmeared movie seats. 

"Seabiscuit" is a finely wrought wild ride that'll keep you holding' on to the saddle the whole way through.
-Felicidad Garcia, Copy Editor



Even the thrill of seeing familiar places on the big screen in a high-budget movie isn't enough to make "Bad Boys II" worth the gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe, forget the price of admission. 

Martin Lawrence and Will Smith return, of course, as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, two narcotics detectives in the MDPD who, on their salary, can afford to live in a mansion on Key Biscayne and drive a Ferrari, respectively. The sequel that closed down sections of Miami and angered plenty of us just last year is shamelessly illogical, even for an action movie. 

Everything miraculously falls into place for them, or floats over them in the case of an out-of-control car, with no respect for the laws of, oh, I don't know, REALITY.

This time around, Burnett and Lowrey are having relationship problems - something they play up to generate a few laughs. The plot is dull and over-worked, involving a drug lord (not only do they tie up traffic, they make the bad guy Cuban too?!) and smuggling and clubs and dead bodies.  Lots of dead bodies. Everywhere. Flying out of cars, getting their heads popped off, having their guts ... I think you get the point. The movie is inordinately gross. 

I expected the comedy to make up for the fact that Smith and Lawrence aren't exactly action stars: Imagine running into either of them on the street, I don't think intimidating is the first adjective to come to mind. But, unfortunately, it didn't. There are some moments, like the scene where Burnett's daughter's date comes to the door, that offer some true laughs, but in general, the bad guy's dirty-mouthed Cuban mother is the funniest character of the old movie. (Imagine abuelita trying to shoot you with a shotgun, while she curses you out.)

There's the de rigeur car chase that ends up on the MacCarthur Causeway - of course - which, if you saw "The Matrix: Reloaded," looks like a scene out of "Driving Miss Daisy."

There are a few half-way imaginative camera shots and angles, but taking into account all the technology that Hollywood directors have at their disposal now, these cheap shots at eye-catching sequences are basically indispensable, and their ubiquitous nature this summer makes them unimpressive.

No amount of flashy cars, explosions or dumb jokes saves this movie (which, at 147 minutes is about 57 minutes too long); not even Dan the Man himself, can save this movie.

Warm apple pie has never tasted so bad. "American Wedding" hit theatres this weekend lacking a little ingredient called "plot." 

The third installment to the hilarious movie "American Pie" leaves little time to digest the annoying jokes and bad acting efforts.

In "American Wedding," Jason Biggs returns as the dorky, lovable Jim, and Allison Hannigan returns as the sex-obsessed band geek, Michelle. 

The movie begins three years after the movie, at a romantic restaurant with Jim trying to propose to his flute-loving honey. 

This opening scene was by far one of the raunchiest scenes ever conjured up by a screenplay writer. The opening scene was funny and up to par with the type of American Pie humor we have come to love, but shortly after that the laughter transformed into gasps as the movie took a deadly turn into pointless, cliched humor. 

The whole movie focuses on the wedding, right? WRONG. It seems that the annoying screw-up Stifler, Sean William Scott, is the main focus of the movie. 

His character was always the punchline to a lot of sleazy jokes and semen- drinking cheap laughs, but in this movie his character is more of a cartoon than an actual person.  

Now, he is a brain-dead,  football coach with a personality so revolting that one would only wish he would act as great as he did in "Dude Where's my Car?"

The M.I.L.F.-screwing playboy Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas)  is also back. 

The rest of the high school cast from American Pie is M.I.A. without an explanation. 

Maybe Jim had a big fight with the rest of his friends because the script sucked and they all wanted more money. I mean...because they just lost touch.

Jim's dad (played by Eugene Levy) is still hilarious as the concerned father who thinks his boy is going through pubescent growing pains (even though Jim is way past puberty). 

Scenes between Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs are comical masterpieces.  No matter how much the movie is lacking, they always seem to instigate a wave of laughter. 

Not even thinking about American Pie's past movie glory as a cult classic can save this sequel. 

It added more sex, more bodily fluids and managed to lack the innocence and humor the first movie attained. It is a pointless journey into the realm of movie crap. 

This will certainly just be another forgettable sequel. Sorry, but this movie is not worth a second helping.

The Mars Volta are geniuses. I'm going to cut to the chase right away and tell you how great their first full length album, De-loused in the Comatorium, is. 

Finding relatively new bands like this who can create such solid, original music feels like striking gold. 

Music connoisseurs may be familiar with an indie-rock band called At the Drive In, which split up a few years ago. 

Lead vocalist Cedric Zavala and mastermind Omar Rodriguez-Lopez split to form The Mars Volta while the other members formed a band called Sparta, not nearly as good. 

The Mars Volta has basically taken everything that was amazing about At the Drive In and exploited it even more. On De-loused in the Comatorium, fast rhythmic beats combine with pulse-pounding tempos, kept feverishly by the drums which exhibit a wonderful staccato sound that is very prominent. 

You can almost hear every single little drum beat. This is relatively constant throughout the entire album, from its hair-rising and explosive beginning to the epic ending. 

Speaking of epic, that's another thing about this album. Many of the 10 songs tend to just go off on musical tangents with guitar solos or bizarre musical compositions that sound kind of spacey. 

The guitar work is also incredible. It's very fun. Appropriately hard or soft when needed, intricate, complex; the things that want to make your jaw drop. I caught myself staring at the stereo, wondering how someone could create such good music. I believe Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea makes a contribution or two in this department.

The vocals only add to this puzzling mixture of amazement. Zavala has such a distinct voice, high pitched and melodic. It reminds me of a little of Incubus, only not as annoying or whiney. Zavala's voice has power and command, yet blends in the music like an additional instrument, never stealing the spotlight for too long or overpowering the beautiful music behind him. His voice is definitely an awesome finishing touch to the songs on this album.

De-loused in the Comatorium is an anomaly in a day where albums of this caliber are just rare. The Mars Volta is difficult to compare to and  they stand alone in their own genre of bands who simply can't be categorized. There are a million influences pumped into this band which is something hard to pull off well. They've done it incredibly well and created a precious                     
jewel for a first album. 
-John Lovell, Arts Editor



Cribbing cover art from the Velvet Underground and a title from Kurt Vonnegut, Welcome to the Monkey House, the Dandy Warhols' fourth album, marks a shift to a glam, synth-laden sound that Andy himself would approve of. 

The new tracks owe their glitter in part to Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes and David Bowie collaborator Tony Visconti, who lend their brand of 80s lacquer to the album's production.

The four-piece from Portland, Ore., formed in 1994, and their sonic relationship reworks itself into something fresh and unexpected on every album. 

I discovered the Dandy Warhols via 2000's Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, where their acoustic guitars and deadpan lyrics merged seamlessly into one of the few discs I can honestly say I love every track of. 

Three years later, their long-awaited new album has a similar effect, although I was stunned by the difference in sound. 

The Dandies are dipping their toes into New Wave, but they do manage to keep their heads above hokeyness: Their roots are still in lazy guitar rock, albeit with a dusting of electronica. 

Singer/guitarist Courtney Taylor-Taylor's voice remains one of the sexiest monotones in rock. Low and effortless, it drips an "I don't care" attitude over equally lackadaisical lyrics.  

On Monkey House, his sound is exaggeratedly bipolar, oscillating between a near-whisper and a Bee Gees-inspired falsetto on the choruses of "We Used to be Friends" and "The Dope."

Monkey House isn't a complete 80s throwback, though: "Insincere Because I" and "You Come in Burned" hearken back to the heady psychedelic drone of albums past, and "The Dandy Warhols Love Almost Everyone" is reminiscent of older tracks like "Cool as Kim Deal." 

The disc is more light-hearted than the Warhols' previous efforts, shedding most of the slow, dark undertones of Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia and Come Down for a more danceable, sing-a-long-friendly feel. 

A high point is the irrepressibly catchy "You Were the Last High," a track co-written by ex-Lemonhead Evan Dando that begs for a press of the repeat button.

Happily, the Dandy Warhols' venture into pop music's past never leads them far into the realm of cheesy electroclash. Instead, they co-opt its more listenable elements without sacrificing their original Dandyness. 

Keyboardist Zia McCabe shines with an electronic bassline on "Hit Rock Bottom" while guitarist Peter Holmstrom and drummer Brent DeBoer balance the retro aspects with the band's trademark rootsy sound. 

The beats are pared down enough to keep a matte finish on the songs, but they do have a certain disco ball gleam. 

In essence, Monkey House parades a sort of alternative robot-rock that makes you want to add some blue eyeshadow to your thrift-store ensemble, regardless of your sex. 

The Dandies are pretty, pouty and peerlessly androgynous, so the fact that they're leaning in a decidedly Bowie direction is fitting. I'm holding out for Taylor-Taylor's Aladdin Sane-era mullet.

Headline: Tuition increase
Subheadline:

Dear Sir or Madam: 

	Hello, my name is Marvin Antonio Abarca and I am a freshman at FIU South campus. I will be attending the Fall Term beginning August 25, 2003. I received noticed that the tuition for the 2003-2004 Term increased 8.5%-for unspecified details-in addition, FIU did follow up and kept their promise to increased their tuition. I am a recipient of the Florida Medallion Scholarship for the 2003-2004 Terms. This specific scholarship will pay 75% of my tuition is the 2003-2004 Terms. 


      My question is, will Florida Bright Futures increase the amount of money that they will cover for the tuition in accordance to the increase of FIU 8.5% increase for tuition establish for the 2003-2004 Term? I ask this question because my tuition for the Fall of 2003 is $1321.34. Florida Bright Futures should cover 75% of that amount, and I should pay the difference correct?  

     
    In addition, 75% of $1321.34 is  $991.005. However, the Office of Financial Aid informs me that I was only going to be given $916. I believe there is an ERROR, within the FIU, 'Office of Financial Aid.'  I am not the only that had this experience during these past weeks trying to pay for tuition before the deadline of August 20, 2003. I am maybe the only one that has brought this, "glitch," to notice. I hope to hear a reply from you; somehow, you can help me change this problem and clear any misconceptions I have. Maybe by presenting this dilemma to your staff, we can al come to a solution for the indiscretion that is occurring to FIU students. Your Colleagues and yourself can bring change for FIU students.

Hi all!

I have a short letter story I wrote while spending three months working in a research station in Alaska, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, last summer. I cleaned it up a bit and was wondering if you would take some time to review it and consider publishing it in one of your issues?

Cheers,

My company's president (Im secretary to President)asked me to compose a letter which will be directed to chairperson of FIU Marketing Dept, Dr. Nicholls. 

My boss would like to offer an internship or project with tuition or books as a prize for the student who comes up with the best idea of what business venture to go with. We would like to build a commercial building and house a business but do not have any knowledge of area or demographics. This project would give a group or a couple of FIU students a practice run on doing research and marketing presentation. For the best idea without using a professional marketing consultant firm as our resources/budget for this project is under $300,000.  We would give the student whose idea is used lets say $5,000 in books or tuition. 

Could you give me help website or marketing student who can give me pointers how to write this letter to propose this project to Dr. Nicholls in the FIU Marketing Dept. 

Thanks.
