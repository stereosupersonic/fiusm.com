Headline: Cuban regime condemns human rights activists
Author: John Suarez/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
In Cuba there are two reasons why you can be sent to prison: committing a crime or trying to put an end to crime. They are both subject to the arbitrary discretion of the dictatorship. 

The March 2003 crackdown gathered 100 representatives of Cuba's independent civil society and tried 75, sentencing them up to 28 years in prison for exercising basic rights, recognizing the world as over.

Anywhere in the civilized world, freedom of speech, freedom of association, dissent, citizen petitions, freedom of the press, and defending human rights are sacred rights recognized by the government. Exercising any of these rights in Cuba is grounds for imprisonment and in the case of promoting a citizen petition, the death penalty.

Free speech is defined as "oral enemy propaganda," punishable by a prison sentence. Jorge Luis García Pérez (Antúnez) has been imprisoned since 1990 for shouting in a public square "communism is a utopian error" and "we want and we need reforms like those taking place in Eastern Europe."

Freedom of association is defined as "illicit association," and if more than three people meet without the permission of the dictatorship, they are subject to one to three years in prison. Independent journalists engaged in exercising their free speech, otherwise known as "written enemy propaganda," can be subject to 15 years in prison. 

Anyone using the mass media to engage in enemy propaganda faces a possible 7-15-year sentence according to the dictatorship's "laws." 

In March 2003, the dictatorship rounded up 27 independent journalists and early in April, Cuban courts sent each of these journalists to prison for between 14 and 27 years after three days of sham trials.  

One of these journalists, Raúl Rivero Castañeda, a 57-year-old poet and journalist, was convicted for working as a paid correspondent for Agence France Presse and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. This crackdown led the Paris-based press freedom watch dog Reporters sans Frontières to declare that "Cuba is now the world's biggest prison for journalists."

Two brothers are serving 25 years and 28 years in prison. One of them is extremely lucky according to Amnesty International prosecutors, because Cuba reportedly called for the death penalty in the case of José Daniel Ferrer García. Ferrer García is an active Proyecto Varela supporter and regional coordinator for the Christian Liberation Movement. 

The Varela Project is a legal citizen initiative that observes the now imprisoned Ferrer García 

Luis Enrique Ferrer, a 27-year-old Proyecto Varela supporter and coordinator, is serving a 28-year prison sentence. 

During his trial, Luis Enrique Ferrer's family members were denied access to the courtroom, and had to wait in a corridor. 

At the end of the trial, "members of the public" insulted and displayed physical aggression toward the family members, pushing Luis Enrique 
Ferrer's mother to the floor.

Being a human rights defender or even an educator can get you into big trouble in Cuba. 

Marcelo Manuel Lopez Banobre was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison, because, according to the dictatorship, he "carries out activities as 'spokesman and secretary' of the illegal Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, dedicating himself to sending information to international organisms like Amnesty International and Human [Rights Watch], notifying them of people given the death penalty in this country, but without explaining the motive for its imposition."

On Dec. 6, 2002 Oscar Elias Biscet was detained with 16 other dissidents after they attempted to meet at a home in Havana to discuss human rights. 

When police prevented them from entering the home, Oscar Biscet and the others held a sit in the street in protest and shouted "long live human rights" and "freedom for political prisoners." 

The group was then arrested, though most of them were released shortly afterward. Still under detention, Biscet was tried together with dissidents arrested in the March crackdown and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

U.S. considers sending more troops to Iraq

Due to the recent spread of violent demonstrations and bloody riots in Iraq, military commanders are considering whether to bring more American troops into the country, a senior official with U.S. Central Command told reporters at the Pentagon Monday.
At the briefing, the fact was pointed out that resistance to the American occupation is now coming not just from elements within the Sunni triangle, including Fallujah, but also from followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in southern Iraq, raising prospects of broader civil strife.
Failure to stem the violence could jeopardize U.S. plans to hand over sovereignty to the Iraqis by June 30, a commitment reiterated Monday by President George W. Bush.

Suspected terrorists die in Madrid blast

The alleged ringleader behind last month's Madrid train bombings and three other suspected terrorists were killed in a blast they triggered as Spanish SWAT teams stormed their hideout, Interior Minister Angel Acebes said Sunday.
According to Acebes, two other suspects may have escaped the Saturday night explosion at a middle-class suburban Madrid apartment. This explosion was responsible for the death of a Spanish special forces officer. 15 other police were injured.
Official reports state that police sifting through the rubble recovered 200 detonators and about 22 pounds of dynamite. 
Late Sunday, the state news agency EFE reported that investigators believe they have recovered remains of a fifth suspected terrorist among debris from the explosion found in the swimming pool of the complex where the blast occurred.

Headline: Program trains science majors for transition between grad, undergrad schools
Author: Maria Merzeau
&nbsp;
FIU's science majors now have a new program that trains them with the necessary tools for an easy transition from being an undergraduate student into getting into graduate school to pursue a doctorate degree. 

The new Ronald E. McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement Program has about 30 students currently enrolled. This is the program's first year at FIU.

The program is for junior and senior students. In order to enroll, the student needs to meet certain requirements. Among these are a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0, either U.S citizenship or residency status, financial aid eligibility, be part of a minority group and a first generation college student. The program offers GRE workshops during the whole year with a higher focus during the summer semester in which special GRE seminars will be held with guest speakers.

"We provide support for the students as they go toward their Ph.D. We provide the GRE workshops to make sure the students do well in the exam," said Patrice Scipio, graduate assistant of the McNair Program.

This summer, seniors within the program will be able to attend Summer Research Institute for a 12-week period. The program will pay for the student's tuition, lab fees and supplies.

At the Institute, students will work with their faculty professors in their chosen fields of study through specific scientific research, some of which would be published in a scientific journal.

Sandra Martinez, a mechanical engineering senior who graduates this summer, looks forward to attending the Summer Research Institute.

"I think that the program is a showcase for what is out there for graduate students." Martinez said. "The program is also helping me with the search for a University for Graduate School."

"One of the aims of the program is that the students remain in FIU to do their Ph.D.," Scipio said. 

But the students will be able to choose from any university in the U.S. There are 156 universities nationwide that provide the McNair Program.

"We'll call up the universities and ask them what they could offer the students who belong to the McNair Program," Scipio said.

Students participating in this program get access to benefits and scholarships available only to McNair Fellows.

"We help them by getting waivers; getting their application to the doctorate program waived, and by helping them get the cost of the GRE exam waived," said Assistant Director Jason Scott Hamilton.

"Whatever is out there to help assist these students to get into a doctorate program that is the goal of the McNair Program."

Congress established the McNair Program in1986 in order to honor Ronald Ervin McNair, an astronaut killed aboard the Challenger space shuttle explosion that same year.

For Giannie Castellanos, a Pre- Med Health Science junior, thinks that the program would provide her with the right training.

"I think this program would give me experience in my field," she said.

"I would recommend this program to other science students, especially [those interested] in getting their scientific research published," said Marisa Henry, a mechanical engineering senior.

Headline: Journalist discusses experience in war-torn Africa
Author: Amanda Ramirez
&nbsp;
Lynne Duke, author and foreign correspondent for The Washington Post, told students and faculty at the 13th annual Communications Week at FIU about the hardships and wonders she has experienced throughout her career, especially on the African continent.

Although her journalistic career began in South Florida, Duke aspired to become a foreign correspondent. She was fresh out of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism when she began working for The Miami Herald. At that time, she asserts that she "had the nerve to believe that she could become a foreign correspondent."

The author accomplished her goal in 1994 when she was stationed at Johannesburg as the bureau chief for The Washington Post. "Life in Johannesburg was peaceful. There were substantial topics to cover there but definitely no conflict, no way to engage in the sort of risk-taking journalistic behavior," Duke said. 

Because of this, she volunteered to enter Zaire and cover the turmoil that the country was facing during the second half of the 1990's.

She describes various occasions in which unknown persons opened fire in public places and Duke, caught in the middle of it all, could only run for cover. 

These experiences and the people Duke encountered became the stories in her book, "Mandela, Mobutu and Me."

Duke stated that the "moral center" of her book is the "profound graciousness" with which the African people welcomed her. "I will always remember the ordinary people I would come across," she said.

Once the lecture ended, members of the audience spoke to Duke one-on-one. She expressed great delight in speaking to the students. 

"Speaking to students is one of the benefits of being a journalist. I like the opportunity to pass-on whatever food for thought I can from my experiences."  

Journalism majors eagerly accepted Duke's advice. For example, she said: "Always stand behind your story. By this I mean, don't write for glory. Don't write to get your story on the front page. Write to make sure you have a factual and powerful story. Don't forget the fundamental thing, which is that your story be about journalism, not about you."

Marianly Hernandez, a broadcast journalism student, said, "I came because she was a journalist. I feel she can relate to the students, especially future journalists."

Another student, Julio Acosta, said, "Being able to leave her country and live the struggles of another country for so many years proves that this author has a lot of heart and a lot of courage."

Headline: Latino Drug Center receives grant
Author: Fernanda Medici/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU has landed a grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse worth $2.8 million, all of which will go to the university's College of Health and Urban affairs. The funds will be used to open the Latino Drug Abuse Research Center, an organization established to help the spread of all findings concerning the prevention, treatment and policies related to drug abuse and addiction.

The need for such a research center arose after complaints that not all parts of the Hispanic population have received attention from the academic field when it comes to drug abuse.

Mario De La Rosa, an associate professor at FIU's School of Social Work, is the new center's principal investigator. He says that as far as the Latino population goes, most of the research in the United States had been performed among Mexican and Puerto Rican communities, with almost nothing done with Cubans and South Americans in general.  

The reason why De La Rosa feels that various Hispanic communities should be given separate attention is because of the differences in the culture, immigration patterns and socio-economic backgrounds that can create different habits of drug abuse among distinct groups.

It was on that point of view that NIDA gave funds to LDARC, while understanding the needs caused by a public health problem in the Miami-Dade community.

Besides conducting studies in this area, the new center will train interested researchers in the dynamics of the Hispanic group, South Florida's largest minority. It will also train doctoral students at FIU and faculty members that are interested in conducting research in this area. 

Another part of the project will be the study of drug related violence and deaths within the Miami Latino population. Ramiro Martinez, an Associate Professor at FIU's School of Criminology, will be the principal investigator in the studies.

"It appears to me [that] Latinos in general have a higher level of drug related deaths than any other [group]," Martinez said. 

He feels that this is a good reason to start a specific program to examine the reasons for such abuses.

With this research, those responsible for the funds feel FIU will be making itself part of a large community consisting of various centers around the country.

"It's an example of how FIU achieves two dual missions: carrying out cutting edge research and serving the community in which it's located," said Jose Dante Parra Herrera, a Media Relations coordinator at FIU.

Headline: Rock group Walkmen is proud to be loud
Author: Rebecca Louie/New York Daily News
&nbsp;
Walkmen, the New York band that swiped its moniker from Sony's portable music player, delivers elevated garage-rock melodies at full volume.

"We're really loud," says organ player Walter Martin. "It's one of the things we pride ourselves on. It's so unsatisfying to go to a rock show and have it be quiet, so we try to be as loud as we possibly can."

The group just completed its North American tour, which showcased its second album, Bows and Arrows. The five musicians previously played - in various combinations - in buzz-worthy indie bands Jonathan Fire(ASTERISK)Eater and The Recoys. But they were collaborating long before then.

In the eighth grade, Martin, guitarist Paul Maroon and drummer Matt Barrick started a ska band called the Ignobles. They all lived in the same Washington, D.C., neighborhood as vocalist Hamilton Leithauser (Martin's cousin) and bassist Peter Bauer. The band even opened for Lenny Kravitz once at a local venue.

"At the time I think we thought they booked us because we were really great, but looking back I think they just thought (our music) was funny," says Martin.

Since then, they've all quit their day jobs at spots like the Cloisters and the Metropolitan Museum of Art to concentrate on making music full time at their Harlem recording studio. 

For Arrows, they even attempted a songwriting retreat in upstate New York.

"We actually didn't get that much done there," admits Leithauser. "It was more like watching movies - and we'll never do that again. 

"We're all good friends and spend so much time touring together that it seemed no one really wants to shack up together for a bit."

Headline: Grassroots guerrillas battle against big music
Author: John Jurgensen/The Hartford Courant
&nbsp;
Many of the people involved in the guerrilla war against the music industry are simply out to get free stuff. They are de facto combatants, downloading songs in anonymity - unless, that is, the industry flushes them out with a lawsuit.

Then there are individuals who stage more conspicuous offensives. People like 24-year-old Holmes Wilson, who stepped into the role of music activist last August, when he and friend Nicholas Reville started a legal defense fund for file swappers sued by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Out of a home office in Worcester, Mass., they run Downhill Battle, an advocacy group that wants to rid the market of what he calls the "oligopoly" of major labels that dominate the recording industry. From simple sticker campaigns to a subversion of a music-based Pepsi promotion, Downhill Battle has built a reputation through grassroots multitasking. 

On March 24, the group launched its latest effort, BannedMusic.org, a free source for music that the major labels consider illegal and onerous. One of the recordings available on the site is the creation of a Los Angeles producer and DJ that touched off a major controversy at the beginning of the year, solidifying Downhill Battle's role as an organizational force.

By painstakingly melding the vocal tracks from rapper Jay-Z's "The Black Album" with musical swatches from the Beatles' "White Album," DJ Danger Mouse concocted his own "Grey Album." He pressed only a few thousand copies, but as underground acclaim erupted, the Beatles' publisher, EMI, responded with a storm of cease-and-desist letters.

Downhill Battle got a threatening letter of its own when it organized Grey Tuesday, a day in February when almost 200 web sites offered the album for download. 

"That was really, really exciting," Wilson says. "People were putting a ton on the line, risking getting sued for quite a lot of money, because they felt strongly enough about the position and the principal." 

Hundreds of thousands of downloads later, Downhill Battle and other Grey Tuesday participants were holding their breath.

"We expected to be sued the following day, and it's more than a month later, and we haven't heard from them," Wilson says.

It was a defining moment for Downhill Battle and for the issue that the group has chosen as its main platform: the freedom to sample music. 

As a musical tool, sampling - the lifting of musical riffs and phrases from other recordings - came into its own with the emergence of rap. But in the early 1990s, musicians who had been sampled fought back. 

In the years after that legal crackdown, Wilson says, "they started jacking up the prices (for permission to sample). You couldn't really use samples legally without a major label behind you. You could use maybe one or two in a song. After that, it was business suicide." 

Today, the logistical and financial burden for independent musicians who create sample-based music is far too great, he says. Short of the toppling of the major record labels that Wilson envisions, Downhill Battle proposes a more regulated procedure for clearing samples, something akin to the standard royalties-based permission that musicians obtain when they want to cover a song written by someone else.

But until such industry reform, Downhill Battle chooses to champion outlaw musical artists like DJ Cheap Cologne, creator of the "Double Black Album," a more recent interpretation of the Jay-Z release, combined with Metallica's 1991 recording known as "The Black Album." It's one of three recordings available so far on BannedMusic.org.

For the young activists behind the scenes, music has formed the next front in a full-time career in activism that has already included labor rights and globalization issues.

"We picked music because, in a lot of ways, it's on the front lines legally and culturally," Wilson says. "It's really shaping up to be this mythic battle. It's definitely history in the making."

Headline: Play presents'Life-changing' message
Author: Natalie Morales/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
People write because they have something to say, they act because they feel something needs to be said, and they watch not only to be entertained, but because they want to be inspired. 

"What do I want audiences to feel? Outrage. Excitement. Anger. Curiosity to know more and some deeper sense of compassion," said Cheryl L. West, the playwright behind "Before it Hits Home," which opens tonight at University Park's Wertheim Performing Arts Center. 

It is a play about a black family's struggle with AIDS. It's about life - it may not be your life, but that's exactly the point. If it's about you, you relate, if its not, you learn. 

Theatre has that affect on people. There's something about watching it live, right in front of you, that no book, no pamphlet, not even this article could show you. 

AIDS has become such a massive epidemic and the strangest part of it is that people either don't seem to notice or they think it's mostly in Africa. What they don't realize is that it has already hit home. Hard.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 886,575 reported cases of AIDS in the United States and our little state of Florida has the third most reported cases of AIDS in the country - 90, 233 to be exact. The Florida Bureau of HIV/AIDS estimates that out of all those who are infected, there are 1 in 50 African-Americans, 1 in 127 Hispanics, and 1 in 286 Whites. AIDS is the leading cause of death in Florida for both male and female African-Americans ages 25 - 44.   That's something to talk about, especially since most people are ignorant to all of this.

 Theatre is often overlooked as being a vehicle for awareness. It is not seen as the powerful tool that it is. The truth is, it can inspire people beyond what one is capable of imagining, and if you don't relate, and you don't learn something new, you understand someone else's point of view, you are put in someone else's shoes - and that's an opportunity we should never take for granted. 

As West put it herself, "The play isn't just about AIDS. Are families able to love when challenged? Are they able to accept the difference?" 

Theatre is a great experience. So when the chance comes to see a new play, take it. It might just change your life.

Yesterday, a friend told me that she had seen the movie "Changing Lanes" and that it changed her life. I believed her, although I have not seen it, nor do I plan to see another Ben Affleck film for the rest of my life. 

In my opinion, anyone who willingly makes two movies with JLo does not deserve to be up on that screen. That being unnecessarily said, I realized that movies, plays, even TV shows can change the way you think, act, feel and even the way you live. 

Art is life. There is no way around that.

Headline: Show blends humor into serious matters
Author: Heather Brummer/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Theatre will open its second production of the semester with, "Before It Hits Home," the story of a jazz musician struggling with sexuality issues, AIDS and, consequently, strained relationships within his family. 

Wendal (played by two-time Carbonell nominee, Meshaun Arnold) is married to Simone while secretly carrying on sexual relations with his long time lover, Douglas. No one is aware of Wendal's private life until the effects of AIDS intensify and his family must decide whether or not they can accept his lifestyle choice. 

"Before It Hits Home" is a serious story with humorous moments. The play is set in such a way that audience members will likely find themselves laughing along with Wendal's family while being quietly pulled in to the show. Even moments in which no one would expect to find humor, such as Wendal's visits to his doctor, prove surprisingly funny.

With the exception of two actors, "Before It Hits Home" boasts an entirely African-American cast. Although the production was just days from opening at the time of this writing, each cast member took a minute to sit down and talk about his or her experience of putting together the show. Almost everybody had something different to say, but there was one feeling that was common to everyone: The cast enjoyed the rehearsal period and learned things they didn't know before beginning. The actors also agreed that they felt a strong connection with others in the show and that the group worked well as an ensemble. 

"Before It Hits Home" offered the actors plenty of life lessons, too.

 Apphia Campbell, who plays Reba (Wendal's mother), said working with the script showed her that things very often aren't how they look on the surface, while Quorion Tanner, who plays Junior (Wendal's brother) had a personal revelation. 

"Everyone can act," Quorion said, "But to act well is a different story."

The cast seemed to agree that the family in the production is similar to their own, with a strong mother figure type that can be found in many African-American families. They felt that people of all backgrounds would be able to identify with the production because of the common issues and bonds that tie all families together. 

Everyone in the production felt strong about the show's director, Professor Lesley Ann Timlick. The cast spoke very highly of  Timlick, who they said was always open to suggestions and took time to research African American culture. "Lesley Ann never saw it as her show only," one cast member remarked. "That's a great quality to find a director."

"Before It Hits Home" will run from April 8-11p.m. and April 15-18 at University Park's Wertheim Performing Arts Center. Tickets are sold each evening of the run. For more info, contact the Theatre Department at (305) 348 - 2895.
