Headline: Scientology's beliefs as absurd as Christianity's
Author: Adrian Diaz / Assistant Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Recently I did some online  research on Scientology because I had been hearing so much about it. I have yet to meet one Scientologist in person so I cannot say that they are all crazy - but at least a lot of their beliefs are. 

Among them: A belief in an intergalactic tyrant that lived over 75 million years ago named Xenu who brainwashed primitive humans with a 3-D super colossal motion picture; ancient space planes that conveniently look just like modern Douglas DC-8s except with rocket engines (naturally they needed them to fly through space); force fields and past lives. There is a great article on wikipedia.com that goes further into detail than I could or care to. It actually gets much, weirder than all of this.

Because of these and other beliefs, it would be easy to dismiss Scientology as a cult populated solely by wackos, and many have, but not me. For me it led me down another train of thought. As I was reading up on Scientologists and specifically the somewhat insane things founder L. Ron Hubbard has said, my mind kept going back to a certain long-robed, chancleta-wearing individual. Yes, I'm talking about my Lord. 

I always personally believed Jesus was insane. According to the Gospel of John (10:30) Jesus says "I and the Father are One." I am of the opinion that the belief in oneself as divine is a pretty adequate indicator of mental illness. What solidifies Jesus's insanity for me is those 12 guys that followed him around everywhere. Crazy people always need an audience so they can grow crazier. 

Yes, a belief in space planes seems crazy to us, but doesn't Christianity have some equally insane beliefs? Mary became pregnant without ever having known a man's touch, a 600-year-old man survived a flood that destroyed the entire world on a ship he himself built, a woman being turned into a pillar of salt, etc. 

Another example is the resurrection. Scientologists also believe in reincarnation, except they believe it happens over and over again where Christians believe it only happened the one time when Christ was resurrected.. 

Some might argue that what happened to Christ after being buried was not technically reincarnation, but to me it's all rising back from the dead.

Scientology contains space planes because it was conceived at a time when space travel was a possibility, just as the myths and beliefs in Jesus' time are a part of Christianity. 

Given enough time and proper nurturing, Scientology could be a major religion in 2,000 years. Just like Scientology, Christianity was at first considered by many to be a cult-like and anti-social movement. Imagine you are a respectable Roman who believes in many Gods and a group of people who believe in only one God (and worship a convicted criminal) trying to ruin your bathhouse fun. 

In fact, it might become a major religion faster than Christianity did. Already factions have split from the Church of Scientology, which I consider to be sort of a Scientological Protestant Reformation. For example, a group of people who broke off from the church in Amsterdam have formed Ron's Organization and Network for Standard Tech. 

This group believes that the Church has become corrupted and has strayed too far from Hubbard's original teachings. Scientologists are going through the motions much faster.

It might seem like a rough transition, but to make it smoother, Scientologists need to take a page from Christians. Christians took many pagan rituals and superimposed Christian values on top of them. 

For example, Scientologists believe in something called the ARC Triangle. It's basically the three pillars of living a happy life: affinity, reality and communication. Triangles? Pine trees are triangular â€¦ Anyone see ARC trees popping up anytime soon?

I suggest everyone get on the Scientology band wagon. It's not too late to become some sort of apostle or early religious leader or maybe even, one day, a saint. In fact, some books of the New Testament were written 50 to 100 years after Jesus' death so it is perfect timing to make one's name in the Church of Scientology. I know I'm going to.

Subheadline: Nuclear non-proliferation should be top priority
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
On March 1, President George W. Bush, along with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, announced an unprecedented agreement that loosens the reigns, so to speak, on decades-old restrictions on India's production of nuclear materials.

This agreement, between the world's largest (India) and the world's most powerful (United States) democracies, only underscores an increasingly congenial relationship between the two nations. 

From an economic and military point of view, this deal is leaps and bounds ahead of anything accomplished in the past few years as far as relations between India and the U.S. go. 

The agreement promotes the use of clean nuclear power, an invaluable resource in a country with a population over a billion people. Since India suffers from a lack of indigenous uranium, the deal would allow the country to import uranium for use in its civilian program, therefore freeing up its own uranium for use in its military programs. 

Furthermore, the deal would allow inspectors from the United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency, access to nuclear power plants that are classified by the Indian government for civilian use. 

Though they have access to civilian nuclear power plants, IAEA officials would still not be able to inspect military plants, which some of the critics of the deal point out as its biggest flaw.  True as this may be, even this small amount of influence is certainly an improvement over the zero influence the U.S. had prior to the striking of the deal.  

On the trip, Prime Minister Manmohan and President Bush also cemented closer economic ties and agreed, albeit loosely, to attempt to double bilateral trade every three years. The idea behind this is to grow the Indian economy to eventually be a regional counterweight to a seemingly limitless Chinese economy. 

Indian television and international officials heralded this agreement as a new era in U.S.-India relations, but we have some problems with this deal. It's not all peaches-n-cream for the Bush administration just yet. 

In a world that, at least in a public relations sense, promotes the advancement of peace, why should any agreement that allows, or much less supports, the nuclear armament of a country be seen as any form of success? It was our understanding that the world was trying to get rid of its nuclear weapons, not add to its arsenal.   

We understand the opportunities that this deal represents and welcome the furthering of relations with India, but the goal of nuclear non-proliferation should be the first priority of this or any administration, not to mention, the global community. 

India's prototype fast-breeder reactors, when fully operational, can produce large amounts of super-grade plutonium. This deal would allow India to have enough fissile material to produce up to 50 weapons per year, rather than the 10 that the administration sought in the original deal.

One has to wonder why India, or any country for that matter, finds it absolutely necessary to have so many nuclear weapons handy. The attainment of nuclear weapons is not so much about using them as it is about having them and being able to showcase them for the world to see. 

It would be much easier if the countries of the world would put all of their intentions for nuclear development out on the table. While this is an unrealistic and idealistic goal, it would at least let the global community know to be ready for the worst.

Headline: Pressure in relationships
Author: Brian Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Love, such a sweet and delicate treat. The  staring into one another's eyes. The late night phone calls. Holding hands and romantic dates. Not to mention time and money. The paranoid boyfriend/girlfriend, and the little habits that you recently discovered from your significant other.

Okay, so there are pros and there are cons in a relationship. I'll give you that. But men and women have always argued, who has the most pressure? Clearly it takes two to tango, but it's hard to evenly distribute the responsibilities in a relationship.

Heck, we can't evenly distribute the responsibilities in a group project, much less a complex relationship.

But what about applied pressure? Do women have the pressure of having to have an hourglass body or having to wear the perfect outfit for every occasion? What about men? Do they always have the pressure of proving their masculinity just to get attention? Do they have to have a six-digit income to warrant a girl's attention?

Erika Lugo and Chris Tellez, both freshmen, thought women have the most pressure in a relationship. 

"Guys take [the relationship] lightly. Women expect more from men," said Lugo. Tellez agreed, saying "both have pressure, but girls worry a lot and always have to look good for men."	

Well what about a man? Don't they have any kind of pressure? Clearly they are the ones confronting the woman in the beginning of the relationship. Let's not forget the ones to choose the locations of their dates and paying for them (if they have class at least). 

Men are the hunters and the protectors. Anything less and you're only half a man. This is how society portrays them.

Well, I think all this is a load of rubbish. There is no pressure in a relationship anymore than there is pressure in our everyday lives. You have to pay the bills, go to work/school, go to the dentist. So why create more problems with a flaky relationship? 

They are meant to be your companion, your sidekick, your Chewbaca, not Darth Vader! If you are getting angry with the one you are with more than you are smiling, something is definitely screwy and you should reconsider why you are together. 

If you can't come up with a few good reasons (and no, "because I love him" is not a good reason) why you are together within a minute or so, I suggest borrowing grandpa's tackle box and finding other fish in the sea.

Anyone that says or thinks one side has more pressure than the other are most likely complainers and nobody likes a complainer. Get over yourself and start realizing that a relationship was meant to forget about life's little nuisances, not to create new ones. Until then I'll be here fighting the darkside.

Subheadline: Men's team ends season with disappointing tournament loss
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Murfreesboro, Tenn. - The men's basketball team's only game in this year's Sun Belt Conference Tournament was much like the rest of their season - a disappointment. 

Outgunned from the beginning, the Golden Panthers (8-20, 4-11) lost handedly to the Privateers of New Orleans (10-18, 7-9) 76-56 in the opening round March 3 at the Murphy Center on the campus of Middle Tennessee University. 

"FIU beat us by nine at home [in January]," New Orleans head coach Monte Towe said. "I just felt the defensive effort our kids gave tonight was tremendous. I think it was the defense and the rebounding that made us tough in the game. It was a total team victory."

For the Golden Panthers the loss was a bitter end to a very tough season. 

"They brought it to us," head coach Sergio Rouco said, following his team's final game of the season. "They hit us in the mouth and we didn't hit them back." 

FIU's senior forward Ivan Almonte was held in check in his final game in a Golden Panther uniform, as he was only able to muster three points - all of which came in the second half - and 12 rebounds in the devastating loss. 

"It is hard for me as a player to come into my last game and play like that," Almonte said. "I always come to play hard, but I didn't bring my game today. I just hope the team can get better and get it started again."

New Orleans' Shawn Malloy and Jacob Manning took care of FIU's Dominican forward all afternoon and held him to 0-for-11 shooting from the field. Malloy added 14 points and eight rebounds in leading his club to victory. 

"Our game plan was to limit his touches and make him work on the defensive end. I felt we did that," Malloy said. "Having [Almonte] go 0-for-11 for the game is a big plus for us in winning."

UNO's Jeremie Davis, who earlier in the week was named the SBC Player of the Week,  dropped 15 points in just 24 minutes of play as he connected on 3-of-5 3-point attempts. 

Forward Nathaniel Parker was a constant scare for the Golden Panthers as he dominated a shaky Kenny Simms inside the paint and also finished with 15 points, seven of which came from the free throw line. 

Ismael N'Diaye, also playing in his final game in FIU's road blue uniform, had a perfect shooting night and finished with 13 points in five attempts. 

"It is my responsibility to prepare my team," Rouco said. "I thought [Almonte] was my warrior. He has been the foundation of our institution. Ismael N'Diaye has been a warrior for us [as well]. The poor guy has never recovered from his injuries and I am going to miss him tremendously." 

Junior Johwen Villegas led FIU with 14 points even though he struggled with his shooting, especially late in the match-up as he tried to get FIU within striking distance. Villegas finished the game shooting 4-for-12 from the field and just 3-for-10 from beyond the arc.

FIU could blame a poor start for the final loss in a disappointing season. The Golden Panthers shot 35 percent in the first half and trailed by 14 at the break, 34-20. 

The second half proved just as frustrating as New Orleans' game plan worked to perfection and extended the Privateer lead to 18 points with 13 minutes remaining. 

The Golden Panthers showed some signs of life with 8:08 to play as freshmen Elvis Lora came alive and connected on a three-point attempt from two feet behind the arc. 

Ismael N'Diaye then stole the ball on the ensuing possession and was fouled. He connected on the two free throws granted to him as New Orleans was over the limit. That cut the lead to 12 but New Orleans was never in trouble. 

Davis came alive for the Privateers down the stretch and the lead grew to as much as 23 with 39.7 seconds remaining, following a second consecutive three by Dusty Driggs. 

"I'm mad at myself," Rouco said. "Ultimately we sign guys that I give the okay to. We are not good enough. We are definitely not good enough. We have to get better players. You need more than just an [Almonte] to win this league.

"I'm upset with our guys. We live in Miami and Miami brings the Caribbean out of you. They get a little too comfortable and I need guys that have toughness. I shed a lot of tears last year when we lost. I didn't shed many this year to be honest. I wasn't very happy with some people's efforts. It's my job to correct that."

New Orleans avenged their first round loss to the Golden Panthers from the 2003 Conference Tournament.

Subheadline: Women dominate UNO, advance to quarterfinals

&nbsp;
Murfreesboro, Tenn. - The women's basketball team took care of business in its Sun Belt Conference tournament opening game.

FIU (17-11, 10-5) handled New Orleans (3-25, 1-15) from start to finish - leading by as much as 28 points at one time - en route to a 69-46 win March 2 at the Murphy Center.

Led by freshman Marquita Adley, who recorded 13 points and seven rebounds despite learning her grandfather had passed away earlier in the day, and All-Sun Belt first teamer Lasma Jekabsone, who added her fifteenth double-double of the season with 11 points and 11 rebounds, head coach Cindy Russo's squad cruised into the tournament quarterfinals. 

"[I am] very proud of our team to come out and play like they did tonight," Russo said. "They had concentration and focus."

The Golden Panthers forced 24 turnovers and jumped out to a 35-19 lead at halftime, thanks to suffocating defense and strong inside offensive play. 

"Many games we have struggled at the beginning," Jekabsone said. "We were really determined and started the game real well."

FIU shot 48 percent in the first half and was able to rest its starters for over 13 minutes in the second half as they prepared for the quarterfinal match-up on March 4 against West Division runner-up Denver.

Senior Faeza Bouderra, snubbed as an all-conference selection earlier in the week, proved her importance to this team early and finished the night with nine points, four assists and four steals against the Privateers. 

New Orleans, a team that featured just seven players with five freshman and two sophomores, were led by first year player and standout Talishia Young who led all scorers with 17 points.

Headline: Professional athletes make too much fuss over millions
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Nothing is perfect, and nothing is a greater example of that than the current scuffle between the NFL and the NFL Players Association. In the end, it's always about the money

For the past few years, the NFL was the professional sports league that the others - i.e. the MLB, NBA and the NHL - used as a benchmark. From an administrative standpoint, that is.

Its system seemed impeccable, with a salary cap, non-guaranteed contracts and a high stream of revenue as the main things the other leagues admired. Again, from an administrative standpoint.

However, in comparison to the other leagues, the NFL players were the ones getting the shaft financially.

For instance, in the NBA, once a player signs a contract, he's guaranteed that money until the length of his contract - regardless if he plays or not. So if a player signs a six-year, $60 million contract and gets cut after three, he'll still make every penny.

If you're an NFL player, sign a similar deal and get cut after three years, your money line gets cut.

What the NFL players are fighting for now is a higher percentage of the revenue share the owners receive. The players want 60 percent of total football revenue, the owners are countering with 56.2 percent. A difference of 3.8 percent, which seems like a small number, means a difference of about $2 billion.

For us average Joes, that's an inconceivable amount of money. (A billionaire can hypothetically spend $1,000 a day for 1,000 years and would still spend way under half his fortune.) But it's still something the players can live without.

The average salary for an NFL player is about $1.3 million. In the NHL it's a little over $1 million. In MLB it's about $2.5 million and in the NBA it's approximately a whopping $5 million.

What the heck? These guys are millionaires and they still want more money. The excuse of the players is that the owners hog all the money, while the players put the product out there.

Well, professional sports are like any other business. The CEOs of Ford Motor Company and General Motors make millions, while the laborers on the assembly line, who produce the actual products, make well under six-figure salaries.

The players will also say they risk permanent injury every day on the field. Oh, really? Coal miners, who make under $40,000 a year, risk their lives, as well as permanent injury, on a daily basis.

To put it into perspective, I was at a Florida Marlins' game once and happened to be sitting next to a police officer. We started talking about Randy Johnson - who was playing for the Arizona Diamondbacks at the time - and how intimidating he was.

Then I said, "That's why they pay him $16 million a year."

His reply: "$16 million? I had a gun pulled on me the other day and I barely make $60,000. Put him in my job for a day and he'll [defecate in] his pants. His biggest fear is giving up a lead. My biggest fear is leaving my kids without a father."

If you are a professional athlete, how can you defend yourself against that?

It's unfortunate that teachers, firefighters, police officers, coal miners and even doctors and lawyers make less than pro athletes and Hollywood actors, but there's nothing we can do about that. I guess life is unfair.

But it's freaking ridiculous when former NBA star Latrell Spreewell is offended when he's offered a contract for $7 million a year and says, "I have kids to feed."

Regardless of what happens between the NFL owners and the players union, regardless of who gets what percentage of the revenue, those millionaires are going to remain millionaires.

And I'm terribly jealous.

Headline: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship to speak on global issues
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
During the week of March 6-9, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship will be having several activities and discussions for students to participate in from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. at the Betty Chapman Plaza outside of the Graham Center.

Known as Express Yourself, the outreach will focus on two types of issues: social and spiritual. 

By making students more aware of issues such as child trafficking and poverty, InterVarsity hopes that the outreach will show students that God cares about the injustices in the world and make people raise questions about those injustices.

 "The hope is that it will be a way to engage students not only to grapple with these important issues, but to see them in the light of what God thinks of them," said InterVarsity member Jonathan Cameron in an e-mail to The Beacon. 

Cassie Straus, another member of InterVarsity, shared similar feelings about the purpose of Express Yourself. 

"College students just focus on the immediate issues and barely notice the ongoing social issues affecting the world. We want to bring awareness to students and make them speak up on these issues," Straus said. 

According to Cameron, three teams are in charge of the outreach. 

One team will be focusing on the social aspect of Express Yourself while another team will be focusing on the spiritual aspect. A third team will be hosting an open mic night.

The social aspect of the outreach revolves around global issues such as AIDS and hunger. 

Students who stop by the information tables in front of GC Monday and Tuesday will be able to create their own shirts and learn more about the social problems affecting the world.

"At the Global Issues station, we will have free t-shirts, stencils and paint where people can custom design their t-shirts on the spot," Cameron said. "The t-shirts will also have a statistic on issues such as hunger, and other facts about injustices in the world."

The spiritual aspect of Express Yourself takes place on Wednesday and Thursday, and emphasizes the meaning of success. 

At the information tables, team members will be asking students what they consider to be the definition of real success.

"For the success group, the main question is 'What is real success?'" Cameron said. "The hope is to raise questions and discussions about successful people in the world, or in history, and talk about the true meaning of success."

The culmination of Express Yourself will be an open mic night in the GC Piano Lounge at 7:30 p.m. March 9. 

At the open mic event, students are welcome to recite poetry, perform spoken word or just share their opinions on the issues that were discussed throughout the week. 

InterVarsity will also be raffling off prizes at the open mic night. 

"We haven't decided what prizes will be raffled off yet," said InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Director Jamie Hunt.

The idea for the outreach came about at the start of the semester when InterVarsity decided that doing an outreach would be an ideal way of sharing Jesus Christ with others. 

"We knew at the beginning of the semester that we wanted to do an outreach on campus to share the love of Jesus with others." 

"After several brainstorming sessions, we settled on the themes of global issues and success, culminating with an open mic night," Cameron said. 

One of InterVarsity's main concerns while developing the idea of the outreach was people's lack of interest in spiritual and societal issues. 

"There was originally a question we had of whether people would care enough about injustice in the world, but we eventually decided that even if people might show little interest, we needed to find a way to make people care," Cameron said. 

In order to promote the outreach, InterVarsity has distributed flyers and will hang banners around GC to inform students of the event. 

For future promotions, the organization has not ruled out working with other clubs.

"We look forward to working with other organizations in the future," Straus said.

Headline: Students create housing recycling program
Author: Grace Taylor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students involved in the University Park Recycling Committee are trying to implement a paper recycling program across the UP residence halls. 

Angelina Troff, who is majoring in economics and is the committee's chair, wrote a proposal to James Wassenaar, executive director of Student Affairs Operations and Auxiliary Services, to start the recycling program at FIU.  

The proposal consisted of what could be done in the plan and how much it would cost.  

During the Fall 2005 semester, a pilot program was finally established.  

Honors Place, a segment of Panther Hall reserved specifically for Honors students, was given the opportunity to test out the program.  

According to Troff, the plan took off when Joost "Joe" Nuninga, superintendent of Recycling and Waste Unit at University Park, said his staff could pick up the housing recycling for free.  

He was able to provide small bins for each room in the residence hall and two 95 gallon bins for the trash chutes.  

Campus-wide recycling consists of the placement of small bins in offices on campus. 

People are responsible for dumping  the paper from small bins to the medium-sized bins located in their respective halls. 

Then, in-house recycling staff dump the paper from the medium-sized bins to the large recycling bins and take those bins to the compound behind the Campus Services Complex. 

According to Nuninga, the recycling staff leave two empty bins at the loading zone and there are two to five large bins in every building. 

"Aside from housing and the Graham Center [they are responsible for their own recycling], in all buildings we place recycling bins and the offices that provide the most paper are the Green Library, Deuxieme Maison and Primera Casa," Nuninga said.

Although this provided students with the ability to recycle in Honors Place, there was an issue concerning maintenance of the bins.  

Students such as freshman Manuel Singleton, said that his bin had been stolen. 

"A lot of times when I went to put the recyclables away, the bins weren't even around. I didn't really know when I could drop off the bottles," Singleton said. 

Although this is one scenario, the awareness and participation in the program is evident through students like Singleton.  

Since then, the problem has been addressed and students on the committee are working together with the unit in the program. 

Troff hopes that the program will expand throughout the rest of the UP campus residential halls. 

"I want students to have the ability to recycle," Troff said. 

As a former resident of Panther Hall, she saw first-hand the amount of waste that students can produce while living on campus. 

"I lived in Panther Hall for two years and I saw a lot of waste.  I would've liked an opportunity to recycle," Troff said.

In addition to Troff, junior Juan Rivera Jr. is also a member of the recycling committee.  

Rivera feels very strongly that the program should already have been implemented. 

He questioned committee members and investigated other campuses across Florida  to see if they had campus-wide programs established.  

He found that universities such as the University of South Florida and the University of Central Florida had recycling programs on campus.  

Although the program has seen a slow start, if students continue to participate, Rivera hopes that it will spread to the rest of the campus residence halls and may even spread throughout the whole campus in general.  

Troff sees promise within the program. 

"I hope the administration can continue to keep an open mind and support recycling. It's a new program, but in the end it will prove to be beneficial to students living in the residence halls," she said.

The recycling committee will be working with the Students for Environmental Action, a student organization on campus, to bring awareness and prepare students for recycling.

Headline: Spring Break Destnations : Seabound
Subheadline: Escape to an aquatic experience
Author: Enrica Rymer / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Every year, thousands of college students start their Spring semesters off with dreams of the infamous spring break adventure, from jet skiing in the Virgin Islands to sunbathing in Mexico.

When looking for ways to turn these dreams into realities, many students turn to cruises for the answer. You're in a different port just about every night, experiencing a different culture every day. 

"It's a fun atmosphere because everyone is on a cruise for the same purpose - to get away," said junior Mikel Urbistondo. "It's like a moving hotel."

The only catch is that with most cruise lines you have to be of a certain age to be able to book a cabin. 

Carnival Cruises requires its passengers to be 25 years of age and older to book a cabin if your party has a member under 21. However, if everyone in the cabin is 21, the previous requirement is void. Whereas with Royal Caribbean Cruise, one must be 21 years old or older to book a cabin and be responsible for members under 21 in your party. 

If you can somehow get around this stipulation, either by including someone of the appropriate age to your spring break festivities or taking dear ol' Mom and Dad on a cruise for spring break, then a cruise is definitely something to look into. 

Two of the cheapest cruises are the Carnival Fascination 4-day cruise and the Carnival Victory 7-day cruise, with prices ranging from $460 - $800. The Royal Caribbean Cruise prices are a bit more expensive, ranging from $700 - $950.

The Carnival Fascination's 4-day cruise is a Western Caribbean cruise with embarkation in Key West, Fla. and  Calica / Playa del Carmen, Mexico. 

In a cruise, you get to experience Shore Excursions - exciting tours of your destination offered in many cruise packages which include the price of transportation and meals.

In Key West they offer Shore Excursions such as a nature kayaking tour to a Catamaran Sail and a snorkel session. In Mexico they offer an all terrain vehicle (ATV) Beach Adventure to a horse-back riding adventure through the Mayan frontier. 

As for the Victory Cruise, they offer an Eastern Caribbean cruise that goes to Puerto Rico, St. Maarten and St. Thomas. 

There's a lot to do in San Juan, Puerto Rico and lots of unique Shore Excursions. The excursions include a Bacardi Evening Experience (drinking age of 18) and a Full Moon Kayak Experience. 

St. Maarten offers many beautiful beaches, gourmet cuisine and some of the best duty-free shopping in the Caribbean. One Shore Excursions in St. Maarten is the Deep Sea Fishing Adventure.

Next on the sea voyage is St. Thomas, which is immersed in culture and heritage. With duty-free shopping - which means you do not have to pay taxes on a purchase - Â­and pirate landmarks, it is one of the most well-known islands in the Caribbean in terms of vacations. 

However, if you decide to stay on the ship during the cruise, Carnival offers many onboard experiences. You can start your day with a breakfast buffet, then proceed to take a dip in the pool, visit the Gift Shop and get a massage in the Spa for a small fee. 

A cabin steward provides a list of daily activities that will take place for the next day and night. With live music on the pool deck, aquatic aerobics classes and reality games like "Who wants to be a Millionaire" and "Survivor at Sea" with Carnival cruise themes, there are endless ways of staying entertained. 

As the night falls there are also many activities to do on board the cruise ship. On Carnival, there are various comedy and dance shows premiered every night. There is a dance club on board as well, featuring a live DJ every night. 

The on-board cuisine includes a great buffet and casual dining area Â­- which is all inclusive with your cruise fee - then a sophisticated dining experience with a set up of white linen table cloths, personal service and a nice steak or pasta meal.

A cruise can be a great way to experience different exotic locations and still enjoy fun and unique activities on board. Cruises offer a way to dance the night away or have a romantic dinner in the middle of the big blue ocean. 

For more information, a travel agency is located at the University Park Graham Center, which offers an array of Caribbean cruises for the spring break period.

Headline: Get Out!
Subheadline: A guide to moving out on your own
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
The following column is intended for entertainment purposes only. 


It's 8 a.m. on a Saturday and you got home only three hours before. You were just getting to the best part of your recurring "The Real World" dream (you know, the part where you're making out in the hot tub then slap the guy for calling you the other roommate's name), when all of a sudden you shoot out of bed. 

'What's that sound?' you think to yourself. 'It's like a cat is getting run over by a lawn mower and enjoying it.' 

Still a little drunk, you stagger toward the door and feel for the knob. You open it and are greeted with what you've come to call the psycho circus. To your right, there's abuelita vacuuming to feel useful while listening to warbled romantic crooning from an artist that no one's cared about for 60 years. To your left, your dad is watching some sort of game on TV while screaming obscenities that the players will never hear. Straight ahead, your mom is scrambling to find her left earring while giving you the condensed 'my house, my rules' speech. And in some dark corner, your emo little brother is cutting up your best magazines to decoupage his journal. 

Without words, you stagger back to your room and shut the door. It's time to move out. 

For many commuting FIU students, living at home is a no-brainer: It's free, there's always food and a washer and dryer is readily available. But as college teaches us to think critically, a vital question arises: What costs more, rent or your sanity?


Breaking it to the folks

Letting the 'rents know you're cutting the cord is no easy task. There's no one way to do it. Utilize your talents - If you're a psych major, have a group therapy session about it; if history is your thing, draft a declaration of independence; if you're all about chemistry, throw a smoke bomb and escape through a window. 

In any case, be clear and concise. Let them know it's not personal (even though it is) and that you're grateful for everything they've done (even though you're not). Tell them you love them and that your love will never die - especially if they continue to pay for your tuition. 

Camaraderie among chaos

Now that step one is completed, it's time to move on to the hard part: finding roommates and a place to live. Get creative for quick results. Post a bulletin on MySpace.com entitled "Sweet chocolate Christ, get me out of this hellhole!" and see how many responses you get. You could also stand in front of the Graham Center with a bullhorn and take your case to the people. You have to figure in a school of 30,000 students at least three must relate. Those people might perform ritual sacrifices or wallpaper their rooms with toenail clippings, but now's not the time to judge. 

As far as a place goes, Miami is in a constant development boom. Remember, the more people you have, the less money everyone pays. This might mean you'll have six people sharing a studio apartment an hour away from campus, but long commutes build character. Character or aneurisms, I always confuse the two. 


Finding the means


If you plan to pay rent, you have to have a job. Forget that on-campus minimum wage garbage. I think we all know where the money is: child care and exotic dancing. Hey, if you're a multi-task master you can combine the two. Junior will adjust to the strobe lights eventually.

Following through

What's most important in any plan of action is sticking to it. You can't waffle when things get difficult. Abuelita may beg you to come home, your bulletin may be ignored and tips may be slow at the skin shack. Nevertheless, you have to stick to your guns. You've taken so long already and there isn't anything much more pathetic than moving out at 24. Oh wait, it's moving back in at 25.

Headline: Smoking the Hookah
Subheadline: Students participate in this traditional Middle Eastern flavored tobacco pastime
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The hookah Â­- also known as the narghile and the sheesha Â­Â­- is a traditional Middle Eastern water pipe used for smoking. From Europe to Asia, the device is used daily by about 1 billion people. 

Widely used as a channel for bonding and relaxation among friends and at social gatherings, the hookah is becoming increasingly popular in the United States, from making appearances in a variety of local coffee shops and Arabian-themed restaurants to being a staple of numerous college students' lifestyles, including many at FIU.

The hookah is comprised of four main parts: The smoke chamber - which is partially filled with water - a bowl which contains the tobacco and the heating apparatus and the pipe, which connects the bowl with the base and the hose, through which the user inhales the smoke.

How does the hookah work? It's quite simple. When a smoker inhales through the hose, the air passes through the coal on top of the hookah, heating the tobacco. This gives off smoke, pulled away from the tobacco, which travels from the bowl down the pipe, through the water and into the air of the smoke chamber where it is inhaled by the smoker. 

Since the tobacco smoke passes through the water, the nicotine in the tobacco is filtered in addition to cooling the smoke.

Junior Divesh Sujan was introduced to the hookah a year ago when a friend persuaded him to try one.

"My friend from Washington D.C. was the one who introduced me to the hookah," Sujan said. "He had bought his hookah when he was on a holiday in Dubai, the city in the United Arab Emiartes." 

Junior Richard Lopez also is a big fan of the hookah. 

"I was a little reluctant at first because of the wide misconceptions relating hookah and some drugs, but after I tried it, I really enjoyed it, " Lopez said.

Ivanessa Arostegui, also a junior, has been a fan of the hookah and the Arabian culture for over a year. She agrees that she was skeptical at first.

"I was introduced to it through my boyfriend when we went to a Lebanese restaurant. I knew it was a water pipe but I didn't know what it did exactly," Arostegui said. "When I tried it, it was great, and along with the belly dancing, the Arabic food and locale, it was a wonderful experience. I always smoke it with a group of friends, in a social setting. I think most people smoke it in a social way and unlike cigarettes or drugs, you can't get addicted to it."

The hookah's ability to produce pleasant, non-irritating smoke has made it widely believable that smoking from one is significantly less harmful than smoking a cigarette. 

Unlike cigarettes, which involves the burning of dry tobacco, the hookah employs the heating of moist, sometimes pasty tobacco that emits only 5 percent nicotine.

Misconceptions about the hookah arise because it functions and resembles a bong Â­- a device used for smoking marijuana.

Sophomore Alison Costa is a frequent visitor of Devine (located in South Beach) and the Oasis (located in Coconut Grove), which are hookah lounges in Miami. Costa said that a lot of people are afraid to smoke the hookah because they think that it is like smoking cigarettes, marijuana or worse. 

"A lot of people look at it and have misconceptions that it's a drug or is like smoking cigarettes, weed or worse," Costa said. "It's actually the safest type of tobacco because the tobacco is filled with water and the tar is removed."

Traditionally, hookah tobaccos were produced using a mixture of shredded tobacco leaves and a sweetener like honey or a semi-dried fruit. 

However, with the popularity of various different artificial flavors in the 1990s, shisha tobacco is now being mixed with dried fruits, natural extracts and flavorings to produce an assortment of flavors such as apple, mint, jasmine, strawberry, melon, cappuccino, mixed fruit and even cola. 

Currently, there are more than 100 flavors available on the market.

The hookah itself is available in a variety of different styles and designs. Most popular among the hookahs are the classical Egyptian hookahs with one hose - most popular in the Arab and Egyptian societies; there's the modern hookahs with multiple hoses that are very popular in Western societies like the United States and the United Kingdom; there are also Syrian, Bohemian and specialty hookahs available.

"What I see from [the] hookah is that people can spend good times with friends and learn from them," Sujan said. "It's different from going out and drinking beer or watching a movie. You could say it's comparable to playing cards with friends. But really, there isn't anything like it. It's incomparable."
