Headline: Spring break program advocates charity
Author: Tania Leipold / Contributing Wrtier
&nbsp;
Helping renovate a clinic in Jamaica is not something an average college student expects to do on a typical spring break; however, some do take part in this life for an entire week as part of Alternative Spring Break. ASB is an international program that allows students every spring break, to travel within the U.S. and worldwide to do volunteer work at sites such as New York, Tennessee, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.   

Senior Gloria Bauta, who participated in ASB last year, went to Tennessee to partake in the building of a hiking trail that would ultimately connect various states.

"It was an awesome experience. You meet new people, form relationships.  We even had a hoedown one night," Bauta said. 

Together with her group, she was able to build three miles of trail in five days. Every morning, they would get to the site at 9 a.m., work until noon, when they would eat and be educated with presentations on environmental issues, get back to work until 4 p.m., and later be shown a presentation, according to Bauta.

Bianny Fernandez, ASB graduate advisor and a site leader, helped in the excursion to Jamaica last year and lived with the children of the community, even bathing in the river like the locals. For a week, she submerged herself in the lives of others, which she said made her experience life in a whole new way.

"From having participated so many times in these projects, it's the cultural aspect of the whole experience that impacts me, as opposed to the service itself."

The ASB program started with an organization called Break Away, which was founded on the Vanderbilt University campus where students developed a spring break volunteer program. Now the program works with hundreds of schools and associations across the globe.

The program director, Molly McCabe, believes that every college student should participate because "it can have a lasting imprint on finding who you are, what you are capable of, and how you fit into the world as an active citizen." 

ASB considers issues varying anywhere from HIV/AIDS, to creating model elementary schools in communities that don't necessarily have proper aid. When students apply for ASB, they have to check- off the concerns that matter the most to them - without knowing what site they will be sent to. The sites are revealed in December, and an interview process is done to ensure commitment.  

The 2007 spring trip will take place March 19-23, and issues and international sites are already posted, including issues such as community development in the Dominican Republic and disadvantaged children in Mexico and Nicaragua. Interested students can apply by simply picking up an application in the Graham Center, room 242, at the Center for Leadership and Service; the deadline is Nov. 17. Students pay $100 for domestic trips and then cover the rest of the trip's cost by fundraising. More information is available in GC 242 and online at fiu.edu/~asb.

Headline: Uncommon pets make for unique home additions
Author: Richard Cassvan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When most people think of domesticated household pets, the usual suspects come to mind: cats and dogs. For Freshman Marco Lora, however, a monkey would be the ideal pet.

"They can take care of themselves and are almost as smart as people," Marco said.

There are an array of exotic animals that are legally obtainable for your household. For those tired of seeing Lassie and Garfield running around their houses, here is a list of alternative pets that could turn the average house into the most exotic of jungles or forests.



Rabbits



A rabbit is a domesticated animal that can be bought at any major pet store. At Petco, they can be bought neutered, which helps eliminate unpleasant sexual behaviors of male rabbits and reduces the risk of health problems in female rabbits.

Sophomore Nicolas Acuña has owned four rabbits in the past and says that eating is one of their favorite hobbies.

"They pretty much just sit there and eat and run around sometimes," Acuña said.

He also says that chewing is one of their favorite hobbies. 

"Keep them away from Nintendo cables; they used to chew mine all the time," he said.

These animals can be bought at stores such as the Petco located at 1655 NW 107th Ave.

in Doral for $99.99.



Ferrets



According to employees at the Pet Supermarket, ferrets are extremely intelligent and social animals that are very playful.

The Ferret Information Rescue Shelter and Trust Society website at www.ferrets.org states that once a ferret has been fixed and de-scented, it will only need a monthly bath to stay clean.

When asked the advantages and disadvantages of owning this animal, Pet Supermarket employees consider ferrets fun animals, but the animals' smell can be disconcerting.

Ferrets can be bought at Pet Supermarket on 1950 SW 8th St. for $120.



Hedgehogs



Hedgehogs are known for their spines and according to fresnochaffeezoo.com, they jerk their body when defending themselves, which drives these spines into the skin of the unsuspecting.

If you're a fan of video games, like sophomore Jonathan Mojena, then this animal might interest you. 

Mojena, however, was a bit let down when coming across a hedgehog for the first time.

"They are cool animals, but I was a bit disappointed to find out they really aren't as fast as the video game Sonic the Hedgehog portrays them to be."



Skunks



A skunk could also be an enjoyable animal to have at home. These animals are illegal to own in many states, but they are legal to own in Florida and several others with the right license.

Freshman Jeannie Lombana, a skunk owner, states that many people stay away from them because they are scared of their smell or of being sprayed. According to Lombana, however, skunks are intelligent and very curious.

"Out of all my pets, my skunk is my favorite because it's one of those animals you think are gross because of their smell, but they are really fun to deal with and are very friendly with my cats and dogs," she said.



Pigs



Lombana, who is also the owner of a pig, says the ideal household for a pig would be that with a large fenced backyard with enough room for the pig to move around and perform its daily activities.

Lombana adds that the legality of owning a pig depends on the area of the city you live in and the physical space of the house in which you will keep the pig.

If you are interested in owning one and want to find out more about these restrictions, you should contact Miami-Dade County Animal Control Services at 305-884-1101.

Headline: SMOKE OUT: Organization tackles tobacco hazards
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Leslie Goldberg has been smoking cigarettes for four years and has no intentions of quitting.

He's been told that tobacco is one of the most addictive substances in the world, but he continues, smoking three to five cigarettes a day or half a pack when he's stressed.

"People tell me to quit almost every day," Goldberg, who is a senior at FIU, said. "I think I have an addiction. I've just made a choice not to quit."

According to the Center for Disease Control, as of December 2005, 20.9 percent of all adults in the United States smoke cigarettes.

The study also mentioned that over 400,000 U.S. citizens die every year due to smoking and second hand smoke.

Goldberg said he doesn't mind the health risks which come with chronic smoking - such as emphezema, various forms of cancer and heart disease - which is exactly why some campus groups have decided to campaign against smoking during November, National Tobacco Awareness Month.

According to Casandra Roache, a senior health educator at the University Park Wellness Center, smokers have to realize the effects smoking has on themselves and others.

In order to bring this awareness to campus, the Center has two events planned to help people stop smoking.

 The first event planned will be the "Adopt a Smoker" on Nov. 15 in the Graham Center.

"We are going to have kits for those who participate," Roache said. "There will be one for the smokers and one for the non-smokers adopting them for the day."

The point of the event is to give a person trying to quit smoking a helping hand.

It's essentially a short-term sponsor program for smokers, not unlike what alcoholics receive during their recovery period.  During the "Adopt a Smoker" event, smokers will be urged to give up smoking for 24 hours to see how it feels to go a day without lighting a single cigarette.

The second event planned is a special luncheon being held Nov. 16.

During the luncheon there will be several presentations about the effects of smoking.

The main goal of the luncheon will be to have people give up smoking entirely that day.

The Center has been hosting these two events for several years and is hopeful about this year's events. 

Mariela Gabaroni, the assistant director of Health Services, urged students to quit smoke because of its serious health consequences.

Though Gabaroni feels very strongly about the campaign, she said more events could not be planned because there were no funds for their anti-tobacco program.

"We were one of the five college level anti-tobacco programs in 1999 and 2000," Gabaroni said. "We lost the funding for our program about three years ago."

Through settlements with the tobacco industry, FIU had received funding for anti-tobacco programs, including the handing out of free nicotine patches. 

When the Wellness Center lost that funding, their anti-tobacco programs became limited.

"Right now, we still offer one-on-one counseling as well as acupuncture," Gabaroni said. "But it's very important that anyone who smokes should quit. A new cancer was discovered in those who have smoked for more than 15 years. And the procedure used to detect the cancer is not covered by most insurances as it's an optional procedure." 

While quitting may seem like an easy task, its one of the hardest addictions to overcome.

"A person has to overcome the addiction, psychology and habit of smoking," Gabaroni said. "There are a lot of steps you have to take and it's a big lifestyle change."

Headline: Annual event celebrates Latino roots
Author: Martha Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students, faculty and parents gathered together to celebrate Latinos Unidos 2006, presented by the Residence Hall Association, the evening of Oct. 29 at the Graham Center Ballroom.

Over 150 people gathered at this year's event, which is held annualy as part of the Hispanic Heritage week, and consists of dance and music performances by students.

Guests were welcomed to dance merengue, salsa and bachata on a spacious dance floor while they waited for the show to start.

The theme of this year's event was Back to Our Roots, and it commemorated the Hindu, African and Asian cultures which contributed to the formation of modern Hispanic culture.

The event opened up with a welcome speech from this year's host, Matt Parisi, resident assistant, followed by a lineup of events performed by FIU students. 

"I have come to the show during the last couple of years, but this is the first time I'm the host of it," Parisi said. "This is a great learning experience about the Hispanic heritage."

Although the main celebration was for the Hispanic culture, performers' nationalities were from all around the world.

An Argentine tango performance was the first show of the night, held by the Prowl Dance Team.

It was followed by a guitar medley performance by Kenneth Martinson and Vladislav Shchukin. 

Despite some technical difficulties at the beginning of the show, the event continued with performances such as a Polynesian dance, a fashion show, hip-hop dance mix, a string quartet and a Hindu dance. 

Maria Alvarado sang "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom," a song from Mexican-American singer Selena.

"It is always important to remember where we came from," Alvarado said.

This was followed by another tango performance from Sin Rumbo, by dancers Jasmine Flores and Thomas Uriarte.

"The event was better than what we expected, to see my son perform on stage was very emotional," said Janice Uriarte, Thomas Uriarte's mother.  

All performers had one main goal in mind and that was to transmit to the audience how important it is to remember their roots.

"I believe that we have to reach back as we climb, we have to help each other as we reach our goals," said Maxi Arias, who performed in a stroll by the Latino Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity Inc.

Insiya Jariwalla, performer of the fashion show which was mainly dominated by Hindu and Moroccan dresses, said she felt appreciated by the recognition and acceptance of her culture by Latinos.

In addition to the live performances, during the event, the winner of the Latinos Unidos essay contest was announced.

The winner, Jenny Terreros, won a $100 book scholarship to be used at the FIU Bookstore.

In her essay, Terreros highlighted what it means to be a Latina girl.

Besides the number of people that attended, some felt that the time and day of the event affected the appeal and participation of FIU students.

"It is very difficult to come to school on a Sunday night. Most of my friends couldn't make it just for that reason," said freshman Mariela Mendoza. 

The performances concluded around 9:30 p.m. with a melody from Voices of Unity.

The event was followed by a Latin themed dinner from Blue Sky, which included congri, sweet plantains and pork and again everyone was welcomed to the dance floor.

Headline: Group tackles human rights issues
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Not many people have heard of the Bolivarian Youth, a small FIU club that has been operating as an official FIU club since Fall 2005.

However, the club has a ten-point program which includes to end capitalism as a system that perpetuates social and economic injustice, to have free healthcare and education, to give access to every human being to water, food and housing, and to turn the means of production in the hands of the people, according to a flyer the group hands out.

"I became interested in social injustices while growing up. I witnessed the different treatment Cubans and Haitians received, so I wanted to do something about it," said Sonja Swanson, one of the club founders and current president of the organization.

In Cuban-dominated Miami, some members feel many oppose the club's beliefs.

"We have been verbally attacked many times while having our table in [the Graham Center at University Park]," said club member Victor Maxwell. "Once, someone even suggested we meet them outside to fight."

However, the club consists of a diverse base, even some Cuban members.

"Some people are surprised to find so many young Cubans, like myself, in an organization that supports the Cuban Revolution. The fact is that just as in Cuba, in Miami there are many Cubans that support the socialist project led by Che [Guevara] and Fidel [Castro], although the media would have you believe that all Miami Cubans are 'exiled,'" said co-founder Mike Martinez.

According to Swanson, the Office of Student Affairs once tried to cancel one of their events claiming they didn't follow the protocol, but after meeting with them and the club's faculty advisor, the event was held.

"I wouldn't say all the times was intentionally, part of it has to do with FIU's bureaucracy," Swanson said. 

The club defines itself as an alliance of young people who are anti-capitalists and who are engaged in revolutionary action, and it attempts to achieve its agenda by supporting immigrants' rights, human rights, pro-choice campaigns, gay rights and women's rights, among other issues.

The FIU Bolivarian Youth were active in pressuring the U.S. government to free Father Gerard Jean-Juste, a Haitian priest who defended human rights in Haiti and was detained by the Haitian government.

"We mobilized the necessary masses on the streets of Miami to garner enough support to free him. We are proud we were able to free him," Swanson said. 

Between lectures, protests and film screenings, the club is always working on new projects. 

A main event coming up for the club will take place Nov. 17, when the Bolivarian Youth will have Carlos Escarra, the vice president of the foreign relations committee of the national assembly of Venezuela, lecturing at FIU and at Florida Atlantic University.

"We wanted to bring him so we could hear the other side of the story, what's really going on in Venezuela, which we don't get from our news networks," Swanson said.

Bolivarian Youth works closely with other campus organizations such as the National Organization for Women, Amnesty International and United Students Against Sweatshops. These are some of the groups that make up the South Florida Campus Action Network, which had its first summit at FIU last September.

According to Swanson, the group is always looking for new members as long as they agree with their ten points program.

"Some misunderstand our mission. You don't have to be a communist or a Chavista to be our member. We define ourselves as a progressive group working for big causes; we think every issue we believe is important," Maxwell said.

Headline: Crimson Tide rolls over FIU
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - Following a bye week, FIU knew they'd have to be prepared heading into an Oct. 28 showdown at Bryant-Denny Stadium. For a half, it seemed as though the 92,138 that showed up on Alabama's homecoming might be in for a long afternoon.

Unfortunately for the Golden Panthers, the 18 suspensions stemming from the infamous Miami brawl accompanied them and showed as they gave up 28 second- half points.

"We obviously came in shorthanded dressing only 52 players, but I was proud in the way they hung in there, especially in the first half," said coach Don Strock.

The Golden Panthers (0-8), playing in front of a record crowd for the second week in a row, were handed a 38-3 drubbing in front of a sellout crowd at the University of Alabama (6-3).

Though the Golden Panthers were the first to get on the board, taking a 3-0 lead following a 37-yard field goal by place kicker Dustin Rivest with 1:11 left in the first quarter, the offense once again stuttered and a costly special teams penalty cost the visitors dearly. Though only trailing by seven, 10-3 at the half, FIU fell apart in the second half as the Crimson Tide managed to put up two scores in each of the following two quarters on their way to 38 unanswered points.

"My concern in the second half," Strock said, "was getting worn down and Alabama made some plays-an interception, punt return and a fumble recovery at the 10. Making those kind of mistakes, especially on the road, is not conducive to winning."

With leading receivers Chandler Williams and Sammy Smith sidelined through suspension, quarterback Josh Padrick relied on four freshman wide receivers through the air, finding success early on in the first quarter when he found Jeremy Dickens for a 68-yard completion that led to the only Golden Panther score; Dickens finished his first career start with a career best four catches for 100 yards. Padrick concluded the afternoon eight of 24 for 134 yards and an interception, which was consequently returned for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter.

With running back Julian Reams also suspended and A'mod Ned sidelined through injury, the running duties fell on the shoulders of freshman Chance Attaway and Daunte Owens who managed just 36 yards on 20 combined carries against a quick Tide defensive front.

Defensively, the Golden Panthers were led by preseason Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year Keyonvis Bouie who now finds himself 10 tackles short of the 100-tackle mark with four games to play, thanks to a 20-tackle performance. Fellow senior linebackers Alexander Bostic III and James Black each added nine tackles a piece for a defensive unit that gave up 21 points. 

Though controlling the pass game, giving up just 117 yards in the air, the defense struggled to stop the run from the start, allowing 127 yards on the ground. Tide senior Kenneth Darby led the way with a first drive 33-yard carry, finishing the afternoon with 70 yards on 10 carries. 

John Parker Wilson and Jimmy Barnes combined for 117 yards passing to go along with their two touchdowns. 

Alabama, who struggled offensively early on, turning the ball over at the FIU 1-yard line on a fourth and goal, found their wings with 10:11 to play in the first half as Wilson found Le'Ron McClain for a nine-yard touchdown. Kicker Jamie Christensen made the lead seven with 4:47 to play, connecting on a 46-yard field goal. 

With the score 10-3 coming out of the half, the Golden Panthers looked one offensive drive from making the game interesting. However they struggled, something that has plagued them all season long, and just over five minutes into the half Alabama punt returner Javier Arenas returned a Chris Cook punt 65 yards for a 17-3 lead. 

Following an Attaway fumble that was returned to the FIU seven by defensive back Simeon Castille, it took the hosts just four plays to make it 24-3. Tailback Tim Castille rushed up the middle on fourth down for a 1-yard score as the crowd that had booed Mike Shula's team earlier in the encounter found confidence in their squad. 

With 10:18 to play in the fourth quarter FIU's fears of a blowout became reality as Padrick overthrew Dickens and the tipped pass was intercepted by defensive back Ramzee Robinson and returned for a 34-yard touchdown. Following the Leigh Tifflin extra point, the Golden Panthers trailed by 28, 31-3.

Wide receiver Matt Caddell who came on in relief added the final points of the game, making up for two earlier drops, when he caught a 6-yard pass in the endzone from Barnes with 3:06 to play. 

The Golden Panthers managed to convert just one third down following the break and started with an average field position at their own 16-yard line, much the opposite of Alabama, who, courtesy of FIU's offensive struggles, saw their drives begin on average at FIU's 45-yard line throughout the second half.

The Golden Panthers will close out their schedule with three home games out of four, starting with a Nov. 11 meeting with conference foe Louisiana-Monroe following a bye week.

Headline: Season all but lost for FIU football team
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
I'm worse at what I do best and for this gift I feel blessed. Our little group has always been and always will until the end, hello, hello, hello, how low?"

Nirvana's 1991 hit single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit," perfectly describes the direction of the FIU football team's (0-8) chaotic season.

Set aside the losses and think where is this team going?

In their first six games, they only managed to lose by an average of 6.5 points, but in their last two games, that average has ballooned to a 35-point average.

As the season has progressed, FIU has managed to squander away games in almost every imaginable way.

It has almost come to a point where fans expect a loss no matter how well the Golden Panthers may be playing; there will be some interception, fumble or other type of miscue that will cost them the game.

Would anybody be surprised if this was the time FIU went an entire season without winning a single game?

It obviously can't get any worse after a 38-3 loss to Alabama in front of 92,138 Crimson Tide fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium (I hope).

But the craziest part about the loss is that the Golden Panthers were actually able to score first and were only down by 10 at halftime, despite playing without nine starters.

Although the Golden Panthers came out with its second blowout loss, it wasn't a result of the defense's shortcomings.

Following the game, the defense was ranked 24 in the nation in total yards allowed while the offense is currently  ranked 114 in the nation in total offense. Both units' split personality has kept them at the bottom of college football's cellar.

On ESPN's Bottom 10, by David Duffey, FIU is ranked as the third worst football team in the nation. Next to FIU's ranking he wrote, "Stay Away: The Golden Panthers return to the field this week. Let's hope they stay away from any fights."

So who's worse? 0-8 Stanford and 1-8 Temple, but I can't imagine for how long.

The Golden Panthers haven't known what it takes to win a game since Dec. 3, 2005. Only Stanford (with a 10-game losing streak) and Duke (with a 16-game losing streak) have been searching hard to look for their first victory.

A winless season can't be blamed due to lack of talent because the defense has surely shown it has the talent to match up with almost any offense in the country. There have even been whispers that senior  tight end Samuel Smith and  wide receiver Chandler Williams being chosen in the NFL draft.

So how low will this season go before any drastic changes are made? I don't know, but it will be a long time before this team ever finds Nirvana, let alone their first win this season.

Headline: Men's soccer enters C-USA tournament despite loss
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's the story of FIU's season - a theme all too familiar. The Golden Panthers have followed the script so often, players would have a good chance auditioning for the sequel to Groundhog's Day. 

They've played another hard-fought match and suffered another 2-1 loss.

FIU (6-9-2, 2-6 Conference-USA) allowed a late game-winning goal, this time against Alabama-Birmingham (9-6-2, 4-3-1). It was the fifth time that the Golden Panthers surrendered a game-winner in the last 15 minutes of regulation or overtime.

Despite the familiar situation, players weren't exactly comfortable with the disappointment.

"I can't believe it. To lose so many goals late in the game …  I'm just so upset right now," freshman forward Christian Caporaletti said after the game.

UAB midfielder Derek Rios scored in the 87th minute to give the Blazers a 2-1 win in the Oct. 28 match at the University Park Soccer Stadium. He netted the game-winner by slipping through a crowded penalty area and getting open directly in front of goal. Sophomore midfielder Dejan Jakovic sent a pass to Rios that knifed through the FIU defense and was easily tapped into the left side of the goal.

Even less effort went into UAB's first goal in the 22nd minute. Senior forward Lukasz Kwapisz dribbled down the right touchline and sent a low cross into the penalty area. As FIU sophomore defender Raoul Voss slid and attempted to clear the ball, it bounced off his foot into the nearside net.

"We've had an unlucky season," sophomore midfielder Oli Birgisson said after the game. "We've had players sent off with red cards in two games, lost two games in double-overtime, an own goal in this game. It's just been unlucky."

FIU seemed to be reversing its bad luck in the 41st minute when Caporaletti scored his fourth goal of the season. As Drake tried to control a bouncing back-pass, Caporaletti rushed in and blocked the keeper's clearance attempt. He then finished the job by tapping the ball into an open net from four yards out.

"I was convinced we were going to win the game after that," Kremser said. "We weren't playing all that well up until that point and I felt pretty confident."

The game took a poor turn for FIU when sophomore defender Phill Fisher was sent off in the 56th minute. Fisher made a reckless tackle that sent midfielder Two-Boys Gumede face-first onto the pitch after he nearly flipped over. Both players remained on the ground for a few minutes, but the match referee presented Fisher with a red card as soon as he got up from the field.

UAB gave FIU several scares afterwards, earning five shots in the second half, including two beaming attempts by sophomore defender Dejan Jakovic that veered inches wide of the left goalpost. The Blazers and Golden Panthers both took 12 shots in the match. 

For senior forward David Hope, the loss was disheartening. A win would have secured a spot for FIU in the C-USA Men's Soccer Championship, but the loss threatened to end his collegiate career.

"It's an emotional time for me. I've spent four years of my life playing for this team and I love this university," Hope said after the game. "If this is my last game, it's been an honor to play on this team with these coaches and it's been amazing."

FIU had to await the outcome of the Oct. 30 match between Central Florida and Marshall to find out its fate. Kremser said that his team never should have been in that position and had only themselves to blame. 

"If we get in, the next step is to get past SMU," Kremser said after learning that Marshall had taken a 1-0 lead. "We'd just be happy to get in. We don't fear anyone in the conference because we've played every single team very, very well and we're capable of beating anyone." 

UCF defeated Marshall 4-2, which allowed FIU to sneak into the tournament, hosted Nov. 1 - 5 at Tulsa. The Golden Panthers are the eight and final seed, so they've been rewarded with a first-round matchup against No. 1 seed Southern Methodist.

Headline: Women's volleyball gets mixed results with SBC foes
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Locked in a three-way race for supremacy in the Sun Belt East Conference, the Golden Panther women's volleyball squad faced their most familiar foes this past weekend at the Pharmed Arena.

With a ruckus home crowd backing them, the Golden Panthers played arguably their best game of the season Oct. 27 with an impressive 3-0 (30-20, 30-22, 30-19) win over the then-third place Western Kentucky Lady toppers.

Unfortunately, they could not build on that momentum Oct. 29 as the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders took over from the start en route to a 3-0 (30-21, 30-25, 31-29) win.

Golden Panther outside hitter Yarimar Rosa, assessed her team's performance against two elite opponents.

"The big difference was consistency. We played so consistent on Friday and I thought that we made very few errors," Rosa said. "On Sunday against Middle Tennessee we were very inconsistent and we started good but then they made a rally and that made the difference. We have to play better and be consistent to get ready for the conference tournament."


FIU 3, WKU 0

It was just two weeks ago when the Golden Panthers had their program record nine-match conference winning streak came to an end, thanks to a 3-2 (17-30, 30-27, 29-31, 35-33, 11-15) loss to the Lady Toppers. 

With that disappointment still fresh in their minds, the Golden Panthers aggressively attacked the Lady Toppers and took them out of the game from early on.

Junior setter Keila Oliveria had yet another brilliant game with a match-high 45 assists and seven digs; leading her team to a scorching .406 clip for the contest. 

Rosa added to her string of strong performances with a match-high 15 kills at a .393 clip, freshman outside threat Arasay Guerra continued to be a consistent contributor with 13 kills on .440 hitting and junior Andra Rasby chipped in with ten digs in the win. 

The Lady Toppers on the other hand definitely had one of the more forgettable games of the season as nobody reached double-digit kills en route to a woeful .143 hitting percentage for the game. 

Even sophomore All-American Megan Argabright struggled as she finished with just nine kills on the night. Kelly Hofmeyer had nine digs and Julia Noe contributed a team-high 29 assist in the tough loss for the Lady Toppers. The win marked the first victory over the Lady Toppers since the 2001 Sun Belt Tournament.

"We played one of the best teams in the country and we played [unbelievably]. We ask our players to come and challenge each other everyday. We have three more matches at home and we cannot overlook anybody because everyone that comes in here will play their best," said Golden Panther head coach Danijela Tomic.


FIU 0, MTSU 3

Coming off a game where everything went right on both ends of the court, the Golden Panthers gave their second sub-par performance against the Blue Raiders in as many weeks.

In their first encounter of the season the Blue Raiders made it look easy with a 3-0 (30-26, 30-21, 30-28) win on their home court and were just as dominant the second time around.

After the Blue Raiders dominated the first two sets, the Golden Panthers rallied around the home crowd and put up a fight in what turned out to be the final set of the game. 

Anchored by the offensive firepower of Rosa and Guerra the Golden Panthers held a 27-21 lead and seemed poised to force a fourth set. 

However, it wasn't meant to be as the Blue Raiders maintained their composure and took control behind the strong-hitting Quanshell Scott. Scott, who finished with just seven kills, was vital down the final stretch of the game for the Blue Raiders and talked about getting the big win.

"We know that this was a big game for us so we just wanted to come out and play strong and do what we had to do because we had a tendency to start slow," Scott said. "The game plan was play hard and work together as a team and it showed out there on the court. FIU is a really good team and we are all fighting for it." 

Freshman Olga Vergun led the Golden Panthers with 12 kills while Rosa and junior Anita Szymanaska had 10 kills each in the loss. With identical 11-3 marks, the two squads are now tied for second in the Sun Belt East behind the 12-2  Lady Toppers.

Headline: Loss leaves women's soccer out of Sun Belt tournament
Author: Magaly Estrella / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The women's soccer team's season came to an end Friday with a 3-0 loss to Florida Atlantic University (10-7-2, 7-4 Sun Belt) in women's Sun Belt Conference play. FAU scored once in the first half and added two goals in the final five minutes of the match.

The loss eliminates the Golden Panthers (5-12-0, 3-8-0 Sun Belt) from Sun Belt Tournament contention. FIU could have secured the eighth and final tournament position with a win plus a win or tie against the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.

Tessa McGarrity got it started for FAU off an assist from Susanna Lehtinen. Lehtinen dueled against two FIU defenders and pulled the goalie out before passing the ball to McGarrity making the score 1-0.

The match remained 1-0 until the second half, when McGarrity scored her second tally of the game in the 86th minute with an assist from Meredith White and Devon Romak. Just two minutes later, Christina Chang was fouled in the box, awarding her a penalty kick followed by a goal helping the Owls go up 3-0.

Senior Valerie Patrick accounted for both of FIU's two shots of the game, including a header which was cleared off the line by FAU midfielder Natalie D'Oria before halftime. Junior Madeline Gannon made three saves for the Golden Panthers.

Typically, a soccer team will have 25 players on their team, but FIU played with only 15 this year, mostly due to injuries. 

Plans for next year include trying to reduce the number of injuries by incorporating the help of more players on the squad, allowing active players to rest more during the 90-minute matches. 

"The team is better and it is a more cohesive unit. However, the misfortunes of injuries didn't help us," said coach Everton Edwards. "On a normal human being, one game every four days is enough; for us to play two games in three days is a tough task. However, every other team has to do it, so we have to get more numbers as far as players."

Headline: Editorial: FIU should invest in curbing campus crime
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The public safety forum held at Lakeview Hall Oct. 17 revealed a safety problem at FIU. Crime is on the rise while police officers are in short supply.

According to Salisha Lall, public safety manager, the department employs about 35 officers who are responsible
for maintining law and order in both the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. At a university with more than 37,000 students enrolled, that amounts to less than one officer for each 1,000 students.

What's more, as Public Safety Chief Bill King said in the forum, only three of these 35 officers are on patrol on the UP campus at any given time. That's three offi cers to patrol five dorms, four parking garages and over 20 major academic and
administrative buildings spread over 344 acres.

Given this, it's little wonder that the number of successful and attempted vehicle thefts has jumped from 17 last year to 61
this year.

As recently as Sept. 27, King claimed that Public Safety's statistics "are not showing the same number of cars are being
broken into." 

He attributed students' perception of increased car theft incidents to idle talk and speculation. A month later, he revealed statistics showing a 259 percent increase in successful and attempted car theft. 

King was right to describeour university of "38,000 going on 40,000 students" as a "small city." Does any other small city
with a population comparable to FIU's have such a small police
force?

Fortunately, while crimes against vehicles have increased in the past year, crimes against persons - stalking, rape and
aggravated assault - have dropped significantly and burglary
rates fell slightly.

Public Safety has clearly employed its limited budget and manpower effectively. 

However, in order to curb crime within its "small city," the University must invest in a proper police force.

In the Oct. 17 forum, King said the department is expecting
to receive increased funding, and also expects to expand the
number of active offi cers, in the near future.

If safety on campus is truly a priority for the University, it must be sure to increase the police department's funding substantially. If students - and their vehicles - are to be safe on
campus, FIU's police force must be proportional to the amount of students it enrolls.

Moreover, "the near future" is a vague parameter. To make a
concrete dent on campus crime rates, the administration and
Public Safety must set forth a concrete time frame within
which the police department's budget and workforce will be
expanded.

Headline: Students blitz for registration
Author: Roque Corona / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Registration for the 2007 Spring semester will begin Nov. 11, giving rise to that haunting question that burns in the minds of every FIU student before each registration period starts: Will I secure a spot in the classes my major requires?

As a student at FIU, you've most likely encountered diffi culties
in registering for your courses at some point during your academic career.

A shortage of available classes and open sections, along with the administration's failure to help students left without a spot in the courses required by their program, make the registration process a trial for students. This problem must be addressed in order to satisfy the needs of FIU students.
 
It's a scene that almost every student has lived through: you're
sitting comfortably at home in front of your computer, clutching the schedule of courses you need to take and waiting for your registration appointment to begin.

Once the appointment starts, you race through PantherSoft to
get the classes you need. It's a competition among classmates;
a vicious fi ght to get into the one available section for your required course, that elusive section with the absurdly limited amount of slots.  You type in the course number, and a message appears that is all too familiar for FIU students: "The
search returns no results that match the criteria specified."

This is a problem that students face every semester, especially
in the Fall and Spring semesters. During registration for the Fall
2006 semester, one student was left crying in the offi ces of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication because she had only one class left to take in order to graduate but it had fi lled up too quickly.

Even freshman students, who have priority when choosing their
schedules, have had problems during registration.

"I didn't think choosing my courses would be this diffi cult,"
said freshman Chris Hernandez. "There were two classes I needed  to take that became full, and unfortunately no other times were made available," he said.

"I know the students get frustrated. It's not like we're deaf," said Allan Richards, the interim chair at the SJMC. "I spend a lot of time answering calls." 

Richards may be willing to assist students, but for the most part, help is usually in short supply. 

That registration is a hectic period for staff members and advisors should not be an excuse for a mediocre registration process. 

If the administration is aware that the same problem occurs every semester, it should provide for more staff to be available during registration in order to assist the students.

Furthermore, department officials must ensure that a suffi cient
amount of sections will be opened to satisfy the needs of their students.

FIU enrolled 37,424 students during the Fall 2005 semester, with a student to faculty ratio of approximately 17:1. Clearly, shortage of faculty is not an issue. 

Richards argues that the option of whether or not more sections are opened rests on three other principles:
"demand, room availability and fi nances."

Richards went on to say that choosing what classes students will be taking the following semester is "hard to predict, but if the demand is great enough, they open up more classes."

However, there is never any certainty that further sections will be opened. 

Furthermore, it may take several days for a new section to open up, and the schedule for the new section is often not disclosed until the last minute. This causes conflicts in students' schedules that then lead to even more problems.

The opening of additional, however, still relies on two factors
that Richards mentioned: room availability and finances.

More effort should be invested into collaborating with other
departments and determining how many sections should be opened for a class so that students are not left behind.

Moreover, administrators should find a way to give priority to students who need to take a specific class that semester in order to graduate or advance in their track.

Students at FIU are continually left struggling to meet their track requirements because of insufficient open sections and thus far, the University has done little to alleviate the problem.

Though these diffi culties surrounding registration may stem
from complicated funding issues and logistical snags within the
University, the important thingto realize right now is that a serious problem exists and it must be resolved immediately.

Headline: No suspect found in 'peeping tom' incident
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Vanessa Novoa left her class at 7:20 p.m. in Biscayne Bay's Academic I building to use the restroom down the hall. She used a restroom on the third floor, one of the few in the building with a double door entrance. 

She was alone as she entered but she heard the door open and someone else came in after her. She saw black Nike sneakers normally made for men, and blue jean shorts walk by and enter the second stall. Novoa said she knew something wasn't right. 

"I looked up and saw someone trying to look between the stall walls," Novoa said. 

"I breathed deeply, and as I got up, he ran out. I ran after him, and when I ran down the right hallway, he was standing by the stairs and just stared me down."

Novoa isn't alone in her experience. 

The past few months have found a 'peeping tom' alienating female students on campus and peaking in on them as they use the restroom.

The individual has targeted four other young women in the past few months, but only two filed police reports right after it occurred. Three incidents occurred around the same time period.

Due to the small amount of reports filed, BBC's Public Safety has yet to follow-up, though it did conduct a search of the area with negative results, according to the most recent police report filed by Novoa.

Julie Costa, a senior majoring in premed, was taking a Summer A course when someone she described as a black male with short cropped hair watched her. It was around 4 p.m. when she entered the restroom across from the Honor's College in AC I.

"Something caught my attention from the corner of my eye, and I saw something in the corner of the stall. I now know it was someone's forehead, but at the time I didn't know what it was until I ducked down and saw the white of his eyes," Costa said. 

"When he realized I saw him, he ran out."

Costa said that in retrospect she should have run out of the restroom to get a description, but she said that she didn't know what to do with herself.

"I was petrified and really scared after it happened initially and felt paranoid the rest of the day," Costa said.

Monique Mattiace, a senior majoring in journalism, remembers discussing the incident with Costa after it occurred. She later came into contact with a black male who resembled the suspect walking out of the same bathroom.

"I asked him, 'Are you lost?' And he kept walking," Mattiace said.

According to Captain Michael Wright, commander of operations of Public Safety at BBC, this is the first time he has heard of any additional cases, besides the two that were filed by Costa and Novoa.

"When we get a description, we scour the area, though sometimes finding the individual is difficult by nature of a report," Wright said.

"This fall there has only been one incident reported, but I'm not aware that this has been a consistent problem. In terms of our response, there is no other response at this point, but the more people submit police reports the better we can develop a suspect."

Though Wright emphasized that with more detail they can find the individual, Public Safety made no attempt to check the tapes on cameras found in front of bathrooms at the North Campus.

"Cameras are controlled and maintained by Facilities Management. If we had a person or a suspect in that area we would [get the tapes from them], but without a suspect it doesn't do much. In of itself, we wouldn't be able to identify the person," Wright said.

Wright also admitted the difficulty in finding an individual in such an incident with such a vague description. 

The description currently on record describes the individual as a black male, 5'11, with black low cut hair, brown eyes and no facial hair. 

He was average body weight with baggy blue jean shorts and a black shirt. Officials have still not verified if it was the same individual on both incidents.

Marva Palmer, custodian at BBC for two years, works the night shift from 3:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.

"We do clean the bathrooms, but I haven't seen anything," she said. 

"But if someone is peeping, there are cameras, so it should be visible." 

The only bathrooms Palmer can think of where someone can get in without being seen are those located on the first floor of the Wolfe University Center, near the pool area.

"If it's about the bathrooms near the pool, they may get in through the back door," she said. "But we always keep an eye out."

Senior Crystal Permanan, also majoring in journalism had heard about the peeping tom before. Though she didn't directly see someone, she insisted that someone moved the trashcan in the stall next to her to cover their feet and watch her. 

Permanan was in the same bathroom that Costa and Mattiache had their experiences.

"I was in the second stall closest to the entrance, and the trash can was at the end of the other stall between the partition and the gap," Permanan said.

"Suddenly, the trash can move by itself across that partition, though I thought I had been in the restroom by myself. I just washed my hands and hurried out."

Permanan said she no longer feels comfortable on campus after certain hours.

"The parking lot lights are really dim, and you never see any security. You might know they're there, but you don't really see them around unless you call. You just take the school's word for it that it's safe," Permanan said. 

Novoa and Costa agree that something needs to be done.

"We need more security guards at night. Sometimes you walk in the hallway, and there is no one around. That's just ridiculous," Novoa said.

"It's so isolated at night, really lonely and disconcerting. They really need more security at BBC," Costa said.

Captain Wright hopes to find a suspect to pursue the situation further.

"We only go by what's reported," Wright said. 

"We make sure to put out alerts to the community depending on what's in the report."

Headline: Event highlights African art
Author: Jamelle Tucker / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A two-day lecture and symposium looks to change the views of  African Art and its impact on the world.

"FIU would like to inform the community about African art. In the South Florida area, [FIU's African New World Studies program] is held as the prominent research institution on the subject," said Akin Ogundiran, director of the program.

The event, entitled: "Black Studies in the New Millennium, Theories, Aesthetics, Methodologies and Challenges," will be held Nov. 2 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the ballrooms of the Wolfe University Center at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus.

Houston Baker, a professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and author of Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, will be lecturing at the event. 

"Dr. Houston Baker was chosen because of his prominent role in Black Studies, and is the best preacher on black life and an expert on African art, life, culture," Ogundiran said.

Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday Nov. 3, the symposium, entitled: "The Idea of Modernity in Contemporary African Diaspora Art," will be held on the sixth floor of the Broward County Library. 

It will continue addressing the issue of modernity within African art.

Modernism in art refers to a period between the 19th and mid-20th century where painters focused more on color and form, not natural world paintings that were seen in the past.

Since most countries of African descent were not considered as "evolved" as European countries, art produced from African countries has not been categorized as modern. 

"The event was organized to provide a modern rival against the European monopoly, and belief that only art from Europe during the modern period can be considered modernistic, and all other forms were primitive," said Baacar Mbow of the Broward County Library system and co-organizer of the events.

The event will feature speakers Legrace Benson, director of Haitian Art Research Project at Cornell University in New York and Nkiru Nzegwu, chair department of Africana Studies at the University of New York.

The library will also open the international exhibition featuring art from renowned Haitian painter, Philippe Dodard whose paintings will be on display for one month after the symposium. 	

The Florida Africana Studies Consortium and the A.C.T.I.O.N. Foundation, an organization created to promote Creole culture and tradition through the arts, are among those sponsoring these events.

Mbow stressed that the public should attend the pre-symposium in order to better understand the lecture.

For more information on the free events, contact FIU at 305-919-5521 or the Broward County Library at 954-357-7478.
