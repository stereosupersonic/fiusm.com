University names new vice 
president for research


George E. Dambach has been named FIU's new vice president for research starting Jan. 15, 2004. 

Dambach previously held the same post at Wayne State University, where he helped modernize research administration and increase that institution's research expenditure by  45 percent. 

He also held numerous posts in the School of Medicine at Wayne State, including assistant dean for Curricular Affairs from 1980-1987, and associate dean for Research and Graduate Programs from 1991-1998.
Dambach has a bachelor's degree in physiology and a PhD in pharmacology from Ohio State University, as well as an impressive array of credentials. 

His involvement in community concerns is also exemplary. He is a member of the board of the executive committee of the Karmano's Cancer Institute and the National Advisory Board of the Merrill Palmer Institute for Child and Family Development. He has also served in numerous roles for the Michigan Heart Association.

In his new position he hopes to speed up FIU's progress as a Carnegie-Research Extensive Institution of higher education, while working on an effective strategy to expand the Division of Sponsored Research and Training.

Student instructors on strike


 WALNUT CREEK, Calif. - A strike by as many as 10,000 student instructors, readers and tutors could disrupt final exams at the University of California next month.

The protest, scheduled to begin this week, comes as contract talks have 
broken down over the university's refusal to allow union members to strike on behalf of other labor groups.

After working without a contract since it expired Sept. 30, graduate students say they're ready to walk out during the schools' most crucial weeks.

Most graduate-student workers are represented by the United Auto Workers union

"Most union contracts include no-strike clauses that prohibit employees from picketing, but until recently employees were not explicitly banned from sympathy strikes," said Paul Schwartz, a spokesman for the university system.

Assemblywoman Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, said she wants the matter resolved before the Legislature has to intervene. Lawmakers stepped in during a similar strike in 1998.

University and union spokespeople said a strike could delay some tests and the grading process, but several UC Berkeley professors said Wednesday they were not worried.

Teaching assistants don't control enough of Sanjay Govindjee's classes to cause a problem, but the civil-engineering professor said he would rather have them around during the last weeks of the semester.

Headline: Editorial: Repercussions should be considered in CIA leak case
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Investigation into the leaked identity of Valerie Plame, a CIA operative working in Africa, has lead U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald to a course of action that treads a very thin line between law and conscience. Fitzgerald, who appears to be pressuring journalists to reveal their sources, must be careful in his pursuit of justice to preserve the trust between journalists and their sources.
Plame's identity was leaked in a column by political pundit Robert Novak, who cited two unnamed, senior White House officials as having provided the information to him. Plame was a "covered" operative in Africa at the time, and is married to Bush administration critic Joe Wilson, a former Clinton-administration ambassador to Africa who was sent to Nigeria to investigate claims that Saddam Hussein had attempted to purchase weapons-grade uranium, claims that later proved false.
In investigating the leak, Justice Department officials have asserted that the FBI cannot conduct a thorough inquiry without investigating reporters, such as Novak, involved in the incident.
To that end, the FBI has asked White House staffers to sign a form that would release reporters from obligation in any confidentiality agreements, a move that may lead the investigation to force reporters to reveal their sources.
Traditionally, reporters have been hesitant to reveal their sources, and with good reason: without faith in confidentiality, sources wouldn't be so willing to pass along information to reporters, thus hindering their ability to gather information and act as a free press and  as civil watchdogs - ideally, the journalistic establishment's highest responsibility.
However, the Supreme Court has specifically ruled that journalists do not have a confidentiality privilege similar to that conferred upon doctors and lawyers, and can be compelled in court to reveal their sources. That being said, many lower courts have also acknowledged that confidentiality is critical to a free press, and have been hesitant to force journalists to such extreme measures, even though it was in their power to do so. This is the example that Fitzgerald should follow.
Fitzgerald must realize that while he may be entitled to subpoena reporters, doing so may have broad repercussions, and that shattering the trust between sources and reporters limits the ability of the press to acts in its constitutionally guaranteed manner.
Everyone wants to see justice done, and the leaking of an agent's name is a serious matter. But Fitzgerald should exhaust all means of investigation before resorting to such extreme measures.

Headline: Living on campus a great experience
Author: Jon Banke / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Believe it or not, outside of finding a good parking space, meeting someone who lives on campus is one of he most difficult things to do here at FIU. It is refreshing to meet someone who does not claim Miami, Kendall, or of course Hialeah, to be their hometown.
Those places are great and all, but it's nice running into someone who doesn't know the quickest route to South Beach, or has never heard of Bayside before. I am talking about the non-local, non-commuter, on-campus student.
With the new semester kicking off, I'm sure there are some new students now living with us here at school. Having lived here on-campus for some time now myself, I thought I could share with them a few pros and cons about our school and our town. FIU is a great place, but like everywhere, it is made up of both good and bad things. 
Like most colleges, even though we live in one of the most amazing cities in the world, we still have to make our own fun from time to time. 
Every once in a while things can get a little slow, but it is what you make of it. 
For example. my roommates and I along with our neighbors over in the University Park Apartments are always trying to find something to do here around campus. 
We have gotten pretty good at being creative in our fun, and that creativity has led us to do some interesting things while living here. 
Last semester, for instance, we decided that we liked sitting outside, more importantly sitting outside in style. So, we built a screened-in porch out in front of our apartments. It turned out really nice and we liked it a lot, but I suppose the administration were not big fans of our little home improvement project. They ordered us to take it down soon after we got it up. 
I cannot endorse building a screened-in porch like we did, but I can promise you that creative ideas like that can make up some of your best memories from living on-campus.
As trivial as it sounds, going for a walk with your friends around campus at night while the school is closed and quiet can lead to some great discoveries. Besides seeing our giant institution in an entirely new light, (or perhaps lack thereof), its amazing to find out how many of our on-campus students are out and about having a great time right here during the night. 
Groups of students have been known to play manhunt, paintball, and other sports, and even have been known to pull the occasional prank running around during the weeknights on campus. Perhaps you will come across an activity that you did not hear about, or a party that you happen to know someone at. A lot goes on during the night on this campus; you just have to find it, that's all. 
Of course many of you already know some of the benefits of living at FIU. If you are from up north, I'm sure you have noticed our warm weather. 
There are not many schools in this country where you will find students walking around in t-shirts, shorts, and sandals in the middle of January. 
While you are here, take advantage of our 80 degree "winters" and year-round sunshine. Either heading out to the beach to get a tan or spending a day playing soccer or volleyball with friends, make sure you get outdoors as much as possible.
Here at FIU we have some of the top intercollegiate teams in college athletics. One of many examples from our athletic department was our soccer team this past fall. We finished ranked 15th in the nation, ending our season with a loss to then number one ranked University of California at Los Angeles.
Student groups like Panther Rage can usually be found at every event cheering on our teams. It is fun attending games, plus, it gives you an opportunity to support your student-athletes in competition. Many of them live right along with you on campus, and they all appreciate seeing you come out to support them. 
Finally, the best reason of all for living on campus is, of course, the people. We have one of the most diverse on-campus populations of any college in this country, and by living here at school, you get the chance to befriend people from all over the world. Once while eating in the cafeteria last fall I realized that the three people I was sitting with not only were from different countries, but different continents as well. It was amazing. 
I can say in all honesty that I have made my closest friends in life by living here on campus. I have grown and experienced so much since high school because of my friends here at FIU. I expect to keep in contact with several of them for the rest of my life. Living on campus at college instead of at home has turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life.

Headline: Armed forces use incentives to lure hispanics
Author: Erika Robles / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
As of Aug. 28, the Department of Defense statistics show a casualty rate of more than 13 percent for people of Hispanic background serving in Iraq. 
Compared to the rates of soldiers, who identified themselves either as Hispanic or partly Hispanic, who died in Korea (2.4 percent), in Vietnam (0.6 percent) and in the first Persian Gulf War (4.1 percent), the Iraq casualties seem pretty high. 
Given that Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority - comprising 12.5 percent of the U.S. population - senior Pentagon officials have identified Latinos as by far the most promising ethnic group for recruitment. Since 1999 the military has put a vast array of advertising campaigns aimed at recruiting Hispanic youth. 
Professor Jorge Mariscal, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, said, "Visit any high school with a large Latino population and you'll find JROTC units, Army-sponsored computer games and a overabundance of recruiters, often more numerous than career counselors."
According to one of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's speeches, "There are something like 129,000 Hispanics now serving on active duty at all levels in Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom."
Why do Hispanics enlist? Is it patriotism or just a way to increase their access to a decent education and a better life?
According to a February 2003 Pew Research Center poll, 67 percent of Hispanics supported President Bush in his push for war. Although the support for the war among Hispanics has dropped nearly 20 points since then, the promise of technical training or money for college has motivated these young Hispanic people to enlist. 
"Education" became the slogan of a massive publicity campaign targeting the Hispanic market. "$30,000 for college" the ads claimed.
Recruitment efforts have also been extended to non-citizens. In July 2002, President Bush signed an executive order expediting naturalization for legal aliens and non-citizens nationals who sever in active-duty status during the administration's "war on terrorism." 
According to the order, they can apply for citizenship the day they join up, rather than waiting the standard five years after receiving their green card. 
Recruiters have even crossed the border into Mexico to look for school-leavers who may have U.S. residency papers. According to Pentagon officials, the aim is to boost Latino members in the military from 10 percent to as much as 22 percent.
As of Nov. 7, 36,177 members of the Armed Forces are non-citizens - making up about 5 percent of active duty members - and 12,132 members of the Selected Reserve. More than 32 percent of all non-citizens that are serving in the military are Hispanics.
As of September, at least 3.3 percent of military fatalities have been non-citizens. 
The first U.S. casualty was a Latino non-citizen: Jose Gutierrez, a Guatemalan orphan raised in Los Angeles. As a green-card holder, Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez was granted citizenship under the 2002 executive order allowing his family to apply for posthumous citizenship.
Promises of U.S. citizenship, educational funding, post-service employment and training, and medical and pension benefits have certainly been an incentive for non-citizens. 	The downside of all these is that due to national security and many other restrictions, non-citizen members of the military have only a small, select number of Military Occupational Specialties to choose from when enlisting or re-enlisting. 
In all service branches, immigrants and non-citizens are over-represented in the field of infantry, where they train in combat missions for ground warfare as riflemen and artillerymen. And they are most likely to be called first to the front lines. 
They cannot qualify to secure positions in the fields of intelligence or military police. Only citizens can qualify to become commissioned or warrant officers, or serve in special warfare programs such as the Marine Recon or Navy Seals.
Immigrants are locked out of these types of jobs because they cannot get a security clearance - restricted to U.S.-born and naturalized citizens only. 
Non-citizen military personnel cannot attain positions in these fields until they've been active duty military for at least three years and have applied for and obtained U.S. citizenship.
Bottom line, despite a lot of people seeing this "targeting Hispanics in the military" unethical or unfair, nobody forced them to enlist. 
It was their choice and their choice alone. Even if they decided to enlist not for patriotic reasons, but for the "benefits," they made a choice and we need to respect that.

Subheadline: The 2003 FIU baseball team was plagued by injuries and missed the postseason for the first time in seven years. Can Derek DeCarlo and the rest of the Golden Panther squad reach Omaha in 2004?
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When June rolled around last season, the 2003 version of FIU baseball found itself in unfamiliar territory - off the field with its season abruptly ended after missing regional play for the first time in seven seasons.

In its defense, the Golden Panthers were forced to play down the stretch with key injuries to its pitching staff for the second straight season. Ace pitchers Josh Banks and Derek DeCarlo were both nicked up, with Banks playing through injury and DeCarlo being forced to serve a limited role out of the bullpen. Starter Andrew Edwards was also sidelined due to injury.

As a result, the team struggled down the stretch and was eliminated from the Sun Belt Conference Tournament, which ultimately led to FIU being omitted from the postseason when selections were made. 

This year, however, despite losing a number of key players to the MLB Draft and graduation, FIU is confident it can get back to the postseason - if the team can stay healthy.

"We have been very unfortunate with injuries. Injuries are part of everyday, but we have been plagued by injuries for the last three years it seems. With Derek [DeCarlo] being injured and [getting swept] by New Mexico State, it really hurt us," said head coach Danny Price.

But now the team must overcome another obstacle - replacing five everyday starters, including its best hitter, Ricardo Nanita, and last year's best pitcher, Josh Banks.

"Every good club has to move forward. When you are a good club you try to attract some good players and hopefully we have done that. But you don't replace a Ricardo Nanita or a Josh Banks and you hate to lose any of your seniors because seniors know that [it's their last season], so you get the most out of them. So between that and the draft you are always gonna lose your best players, but I feel like we have done a good job recruiting and we can fill the gaps," said Price.

In addition to Banks and Nanita, the Golden Panthers will be without seniors Michael New, Skip Adams, Adam Summerell, Solomon Frieder, as well as starting pitcher Arthur Santos, who was drafted by the Boston Red Sox. As a result, FIU will need to fill holes at catcher, third base, second base and two outfield positions. 

One of the outfield positions will be occupied by last season's starting second baseman, sophomore Dennis Diaz, who will make a move to centerfield, a position Price believes Diaz is well-suited for.

"I think Dennis can be one of the best centerfielders in the country and I believe that. His ability is so natural, that I think as good of a second baseman as he was, I think he can be that much better in the outfield," Price said.

Diaz is expected to lead off as he did last year, where he led the conference with 25 stolen bases and batted .328.

"It's important Dennis leads off. He went away this summer and worked on some things and I expect him to be even better. Nobody wants to win more than this kid. If Dennis gets on base and does what I know he can do, he will make things happen for us," Price said.

Who bats behind Diaz in the lineup is still undecided. A strong candidate could be Bryan Pullin, who was named a Freshman All-American last season, while playing first base and serving as DH. This season, Pullin could see time in left field, a position Price is hopeful Pullin can play. Pullin batted .322 with 59 total bases for FIU.

"Bryan could probably play left field and that would put another bat in our lineup. He can swing the bat and he's a really tough out," said Price.

Sophomore Brian Aragon (.209, 13 runs) looks to be the favorite to round out the outfield and start in right field. 

"Right now, Aragon seems to be the frontrunner for right field. He's a solid outfielder," Price said.

But Price expects to use a wide range of players in the outfield and at the DH position where freshman Victor Rodriguez, sophomore Yahmed Yema (.247, five homeruns, 20 RBI), junior transfer Jeff Skellenger, junior Mario Suarez and senior Fernando Alvarez (.266, five homeruns, 21 RBI) will all see playing time.

The leading contender to start at first base at this point appears to be sophomore Mike Lopez, who batted .325 with five homeruns and 24 RBI last season. 

"Mike Lopez comes to play everyday and that is something we will need because it's contagious for the young guys," Price said.

Second base is up for grabs with freshman Eduardo Davila, sophomore David San Juan and senior transfer P.J. Lehmann competing for playing time. Davila figures to be the frontrunner at this point because of his strong defense.

"I think we have a chance to be strong up the middle. I think Davila is very strong defensively and could be very good filling in for Diaz at second," Price said.

Sophomore Luis Rivera (.337, 14 stolen bases, 41 RBI) will be the starting shortstop and will probably bat second or third in the lineup. Rivera led FIU in hits (83), doubles (15), at-bats (246) and games played (58) in 2003, while also being named a Freshman All-American. He also was stellar on defense, committing only eight errors the entire season, giving FIU a formidable double-play combo with Davila this season.

"If [Rivera] and Davila do as well as I think they can, it can be one of the best middles we've ever had here at FIU," Price said. "Offensively, Luis was the most clutch hitter we had last year. Everything happened for him. He had a lot of hits fall in for him, but he also had a lot of should-have-been hits taken away from him, so it worked both ways.  I want him to play solid on defense and put the ball in play. If he puts the ball in play, he will be fine. He's just such an outstanding player."

At third base, senior James Bacon will compete with Lehmann. Bacon hit .275 with five homers and 19 RBI last season. Lehmann batted .256 with 19 RBI last season at UCF. 

Catcher is an interesting position with three guys competing for the job left vacant by New. Freshman Cody Jacobs has impressed coaches during the off season with his bat, but returning for FIU is junior Adrian Casanova and senior Mario Monreal.

"Jacobs has had a great fall, but if Adrian is healthy, he can really help us. And then there's Monreal too, so that position is so wide open," Price said.

Pitching is a position FIU will depend on if it is going to get back to the postseason. The starting pitching rotation is not set, but a few players are locks to start.

Junior pitcher DeCarlo, who has missed parts of his freshman and sophomore years due to injuries, is back healthy and will probably serve as the Golden Panthers' ace. 

DeCarlo is 17-0 in his FIU career with a 3.47 ERA and 172 strikeouts.

"We're looking for Derek to get back. They cleaned up his hip and he's coming along well. How quick can he go up and grab that No. 1 spot is gonna be up to him though," Price said.

Sophomore Ammer Cabrera and seniors Luis Gazitua and Edwards are also expected to be part of the starting rotation. Cabrera recorded 11 strikeouts against Sacred Heart last season and fanned eight Miami Hurricanes in relief work last year. Gazitua is 9-5 with a 5.36 ERA in three seasons at FIU.

Edwards was drafted by the New York Yankees despite missing most of the past two seasons due to injury, but decided to stay for his last season at FIU. 

"Andrew is a guy who when healthy, can challenge for that No. 1 spot and Ammer can do the same," Price said.

The guy to watch out for is junior transfer Mark Worrell (University of Arizona), who has impressed coaches during the fall with his amazing fastball.

"Mark throws hard. He had a very good season in the Cape Cod league this summer. He's a kid that can really help us if he pitches like he did this summer," Price said.

The role of closer will probably go to sophomore Edgar Ramirez, who recorded six saves last season. But Price said he would like to see Ramirez get some starts this year.

The leaders in the bullpen should be sophomore Frank Gonzalez and junior Manuel Monreal, who combined to pitch over 52 innings a season ago. 

A crew of newcomers consisting of juniors Danny Hernandez, Mike Dolgos, Denny Hernandez, Jon Banke and freshman Derek Antelo should also see time out of the bullpen.

With lots of new faces and no true power threat, FIU will need to play small ball to win.

"We are pretty good on the mound and solid defensively. We're gonna have to scratch for some runs here though. Is the ball gonna be flying out of the park? I don't think so. We don't have that power hitter in the middle of the lineup like we did with Nanita. This team is built around pitching and defense," Price said.

Even though he knows it won't be easy, Price is counting on his veteran players to lead the way.

Said Price: "The guys that have been here know the grind and how hard the conference is and our goal is to win every game."

The team kicks off the season at home against Florida A&M on Jan. 30.

Headline: Aiming to build on last year's success
Subheadline: After reaching regionals for the first time in school history last season, the FIU softball team returns with its core of star players intact and ready to advance further in 2004.
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Who needs the top of the order anyway?

That and who will replace three starting outfielders seem like the only real questions the FIU softball team will need to address this season, with every other position seemingly intact after a successful 2003 campaign.

FIU will be without shortstop Stephanie Wolter, last year's leadoff hitter and without the No. 2 hitter in the lineup, centerfielder Nicole Dubovik, who both graduated. The Golden Panthers will also be without left fielder Meagan Dontrich (graduation) and right fielder Amber Gill who left the team for personal reasons.

Besides that, FIU seems to be in great shape and is looking to build off of last year's 37-27 season and its first regional appearance.

"We lost our table setters and our two best base runners in Wolter and Dubovik and we lost our entire outfield, but I feel like this is the most talented team I have ever been around," said head coach Kim Gwydir.

Filling in at Wolter's leadoff spot in the lineup will be Jacque Vetters, who will also replace Dubovik in centerfield.

"I expect Jacque to lead off. She has a great arm, great speed and great power. She should  be able to give us some power out of that spot," Gwydir said. 

Left field will be occupied by freshman Deomni Murray, who has impressed coaches with her speed.

"Murray is the fastest player on our team, which is a plus since we lost our two fastest players [Wolter and Dubovik]," said Gwydir.

Right field will be a battle between junior Yarah Otero and freshman Brittany Witherow. 

The difference between those two is that Otero is more of a slap hitter while Witherow is more of a power hitter.

But defensively, Gwydir believes this outfield has the potential to be better than last year's unit.

"We are gonna have a lot of athleticism in the outfield. They are still learning to play with each other, but they are so fast and have already collided a couple times. But they are learning and have the potential to be a better outfield than last year," said Gwydir.

Besides Wolter, the starting infield will be the same with senior Cindy Turek at first base, junior Lindsay Tippings at second base, senior Jenny Owens at third base and senior Marleah Stapf at catcher. Freshman Tabitha Embry will replace Wolter at shortstop.

"Embry is one of the best hitters we have had as a freshman. We are very excited about her," Gwydir said.

Senior Kristen Perry will be the main DH, after hitting .284 with two homeruns and 20 RBI last season. She will also see time at catcher.

Perry will join Turek (.296, nine doubles, 26 RBI), Owens (.363, 12 doubles, two homeruns, 39 RBI) and Stapf (.240, 10 doubles, eight homeruns, 22 RBI) in the middle of the lineup, giving FIU a dangerous foursome of power.

"I don't know any other team that can put four batters of that caliber in the middle of the order. We have tremendous depth in the middle of the order," Gwydir said.

Gwydir will need all four to step up to keep pace with last year's Sun Belt champion, Louisiana-Lafayette.

"I feel really good with the kids we have. I think we can compete for the conference title. I hope we are right there with [Louisiana-Lafayette]. We definitely have the talent," Gwydir said.

The Golden Panthers will also need strong pitching to surpass the Rajin' Cajuns and Gwydir believes she has the best pitching staff in the conference.

The ace of the staff is junior lefty Amanda Nealer who was 12-6 with a 1.09 ERA and 76 strikeouts in 2003.

"Amanda is the real deal. She can step on the mound and win a game for you by herself by shutting out an opponent. She's a tough customer because you don't see too many lefties in softball," Gwydir said.

Joining Nealer on the pitching staff will be senior Kendra Laminack who was 8-8 with a 1.72 ERA and 88 strikeouts last season. Sophomore Nicole Barrett will move from the bullpen to a starting role this year. 

"Barrett led the country in saves last year, but I expect her to get more innings starting," Gwydir said. "With three quality pitchers, our pitching is gonna be our backbone."

With strong pitching, FIU will have to be able to swing the bat in the clutch though. 

The Golden Panthers struggled to score runs in Regionals last season, but Gwydir thinks that with a year of experience and three key seniors in the middle of the lineup, the offense will be a lot better.

"I think we are better hitting this year, so if we put some runs up on the board, this team can go a long way," Gwydir said. Jenny [Owens] and Cindy [Turek] were so clutch for us offensively last year and we are going to need that again. I believe we have the talent to compete against anyone in the country. Last year Amanda [Nealer] shut out Alabama and they went to the championship game," Gwydir said.

So if everything goes according to plan, this team should at the very least make it to Regionals, where the Panthers were eliminated on the first day of play last year.

"If we don't make Regionals, it will be a tragic disappointment," Gwydir said.

FIU's first game is against Kentucky on Jan. 30.

Subheadline: Dennis Diaz will be counting on speed and improved on-base percentage - all while playing a new position - to guide FIU Baseball back to prominence.
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Entering his third season in the FIU baseball program, junior Dennis Diaz has seen the best and worst of times. 

From his game-winning homerun in the conference tournament last season to the devastating three-game home sweep at the hands of New Mexico State at the conclusion of the regular season (which ultimately resulted in FIU's first absence from regional play in nearly seven years), Diaz has seen it all.

So when he entered camp this off season - even though the team has lost star pitcher Josh Banks, star slugger Ricardo Nanita and four key seniors to graduation - and said he noticed a new, positive team-first attitude that will propel this team further than last year's squad, one would have to give Diaz the benefit of the doubt.

"There's a lot more excitement," Diaz said. "I can sense it because I've been here for three years. A lot of new things are going on. You're going to see a new style of FIU baseball. You're going to see a lot of enthusiasm and we're going to be better."

It would be hard to fathom, though, the fact that an FIU team without Banks, Nanita, starting catcher Mike New, starting outfielder Adam Summerell, starting third baseman Skip Adams and reliable outfielder Solomon Frieder could be better this year without them, but Diaz doesn't see it that way.

"We have people to fill those guys' shoes here," Diaz said. "We don't rebuild. We reload."

Diaz said last year's struggles were based around mental mistakes and a lack of team focus - something the coaches have worked on correcting since season's end. Diaz believes that despite a depleted roster, team unity will help this team accomplish the goals that last year's team couldn't.

"We have changed certain things that we did wrong last year, mostly mental things. Everyone knows what the main focus is now. The coaches have been stressing one thing this year and that's baseball. We have done a lot of team things. Everything we do is as a team. We work out as a team; we go out as a team. If one person gets in trouble, we all get in trouble. Everything is team," Diaz said. "Things are a lot stricter. Nobody can complain about playing time or anything like that."

Diaz is one player who shouldn't have to worry about playing time, but will have to worry about playing a new position this year. With the departure of Nanita (FIU's starting centerfielder last season), Diaz was asked by head coach Danny Price to play centerfield.

"It's not permanent, but coach approached me and said the way to make the team better is me moving to centerfield. Whatever helps the team, I'm gonna do. I've been practicing out there and the plan is me starting at centerfield," Diaz said.

However, Diaz thinks the switch from second base (where he played last season) to the outfield will be a relatively smooth transition.

"To me, centerfield is easier. It helps show my natural abilities, because I have a good arm and can cover a lot of ground," Diaz said.

"Nanita was a big loss so that's one of the holes I need to fill. But I'm not going to focus on learning to play center. I just need to focus on little, minor things like the sun and the fly balls, which are tougher than a lot of people think. Knowing my territory and little things like that are things I need to work on, but it's easy to me."

But what makes Diaz the perfect fit to fill in the wide range of space a centerfielder is responsible for is his speed - something that not only helps him defensively, but offensively as well. 

It's that speed that has always given Diaz an advantage over other players his whole life.

"I've always been the fastest guy on every team I've ever been on. It's not something I've relied on, but it's been something that has helped me. But I have always been a good hitter. I've always wanted to hit the ball hard, so I don't just consider myself a slap hitter. I use my speed to my advantage," Diaz said.

Diaz proved his ability to hit the ball for power last season in a Sun Belt Conference Tournament elimination game, hitting a two-out, two-run, game-winning homer in the sixth inning to give FIU a 5-4 win over Arkansas State. The homerun was Diaz's first of the season and third of his career.

"That homerun was special because I like coming up in a big game and coming up with the big hit," Diaz said. 

And Diaz came up with plenty of big hits for FIU in his sophomore season, hitting .328, including a nine-game hitting streak in February. Diaz also led the team and conference in stolen bases (26 steals in 35 attempts). 

Diaz hit safely in 40 of 53 games and finished third on the team in hits (58), runs (36) and on-base percentage (.429), but said he knows he needs to improve the on-base percentage if this team is going to make a trip to Omaha.

"For me, I just need to get on base. It doesn't matter how. On-base percentage is key. You can't strike out that much. You gotta get on base so everybody behind you in the lineup gets confidence from you," Diaz said. "Last year I feel like I had too many strikeouts (Diaz was second on the team with 42 strikeouts last season), but I've improved that. It all goes back to  on-base percentage. Cutting down my [strikeouts] is definitely something I've worked on throughout the summer. I should lead my team and the conference in runs this year. That's my main goal besides my team winning."

But Diaz has another goal as well: improving his total number of steals and his stolen base percentage after getting caught nine times last season - something that Diaz does not let discourage him.

"A base stealer is gonna get caught sometimes. Look at Juan Pierre from the Marlins. He got caught at least 20 times, but look how important he was to that team. I would say most of the times I got caught were because I got thrown out on poor pitch selection," Diaz said.

"I would steal on a fastball count that I shouldn't have stolen on - just immature mistakes that I am improving on. I've also been changing up my rhythm, so [opposing teams] don't know when I'm going [to steal]. You just gotta keep them off balance."

And Diaz knows that if he improves in all the areas he knows he can, his team will feed off of him and erase the memory of last season's disappointment.

"My personal goal is to steal 50 bags or more. I think I will steal more bags the further we get because that's more games that we play," Diaz said.

hat goal and my on-base percentage getting over .450 are my two main goals. I think if I perform those two things, everything else will come. The guys behind me will be able to produce runs if I do my part."

However, Diaz knows that the team comes before the individual goals, but he feels that meeting individual expectations will help the team accomplish its goals and get the team back on track.

"I just want to win. Our goals as a team are no less than getting to Omaha, and when we get there we will win it. Anything less than getting there is not good [enough]. We want to win conference and then move from there. Good things will happen when you have good people pulling for the same thing," Diaz said. 

Diaz, all of five feet, eight inches and not even 180 pounds, is not the biggest guy on the team, but he is the most experienced everyday player on the roster. 

He has worked out relentlessly since the off season to put him in a position to lead this young team.

"Dennis is the biggest, little guy I know. Scouts are always concerned with size, but he works harder than anybody else," said teammate and fellow pitcher Derek DeCarlo. 

"He's in the weight room working harder than anyone else to make up for it. He's gotten a lot better since his first year. He has really stepped into a leadership type role."

And the leadership role is exactly what Diaz wants. He wants the responsibility of being the guy the younger players look up to and wants to be the guy counted on.

Said Diaz: "I consider myself a big part of this team. I'm a leader on the field. The way you carry yourself and doing the right thing is important. If we don't get far this year, I will blame a lot of it on me, because I feel I can help carry this team to where it needs to go if I do what I'm capable of doing."

Headline: One sport down, one more to go for Owens
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A leader and star on both the volleyball and softball team, Jennifer Owens is conquering it all at FIU. With volleyball season just ending, Owens must now shift her attention from the court to the diamond, where the softball team prepares to begin play in 2004.

Owens, 21, led FIU in hitting (.363), doubles (12) and RBI (39) last season, and was a major reason the Golden Panthers reached Regionals for the first time in team history.

She also knocked out two homeruns and provided excellent defense at third base as one of the team's defensive leaders as well. The remarkable part about her effort is that she did all of this directly after putting in a full season of volleyball, dealing with the hectic schedule and long road trips once already this year. 

But if anyone can handle it, it's Owens, who has been a star athlete her whole life.

"Jenny is the best athlete I have ever coached. She has been rock solid for us for four years now and nobody has been as clutch as she has been for us," said head softball coach Kim Gwydir.

Named The Miami Herald's Female Athlete of the year in 2000, Owens entered FIU as a freshman with an invitation to compete in her two favorite sports, volleyball and softball - an invitation she didn't hesitate to accept. Now, four years later in her senior year and competing almost year round, Owens has grown accustomed to having little free time.

"I am very used to having no time to do anything else, but my family gives me a lot of support," said Owens.

 As one of three team captains on the softball team, Jennifer holds the career RBI record at 78, is ranked third in home runs with six and is one of only three two-sport athletes on the team. Despite favoring the infield position of third base, she mostly pitched and played shortstop before entering FIU and was voted Co-Freshman of the Year in the Sun Belt Conference and second-team All-League at third base.

Along with a starting spot on the softball field, Jennifer holds a valuable position on the volleyball team where she posted a .252 hitting percentage.  She finished first as a freshman with 18 block solos and was third in hitting percentage and block assists. 

However, Owens does more than contribute on the field. 

After softball season ends, Owens takes on another role as a director of the "Panther Camp" during the summer at FIU.

As an elementary education major, Owens has only one semester and one season of softball left before she moves on to the next level. 

She hopes to graduate and possibly continue studying to achieve a master's degree.

However, there is still only one piece of the puzzle missing for Owens and FIU. 

"My goal is to just win a conference; we have never won one yet," Owens said. 

If Owens continues to improve on her team-leading hitting numbers from a season ago, the FIU softball team will be even closer to obtaining that goal.

Headline: Selective filtering, not strict legislation, may be solution to spam problem
Author: Michael Botos / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Not all spam e-mail is bad. Wait - hear me out.
 Under the so-called "Can SPAM Act" just signed into law by President Bush, the federal government will shut your inbox to annoying mass e-mail. That seems like a welcome thing, except the law also shuts your inbox to the occasional offer you might want - one person's annoying e-mail is someone else's great deal. 
Don't get me wrong. I abhor unsolicited spam. But regulation and "Do Not Spam" directives won't solve the problem. It's time we consider a little innovation around the spam problem rather than throw the baby out with the bathwater.
It's worth considering because, though we think we hate spam, there are times when we follow up on an unsolicited sales pitch and find something we like enough to buy. A general rule-of-thumb is that direct marketing, including spam, typically generates a response 1 percent to 2 percent of the time.
That might not sound like a lot, but such a rate means spam gets read pretty often. In fact, many successful catalog companies have been built on direct-mail campaigns with similar response rates.
 And consider that spammers aren't interested in grabbing the eyeballs of people who won't ever click on their product. But given the uncertainty of the target market and low marginal cost of Internet marketing, spam can't get anywhere unless it goes everywhere. Therefore the answer to the spam problem is not a "Do Not Spam" list but an end to the fire-hose method of sending messages. A business opportunity exists for the company willing to invest in narrowcasting spam to people who want it.
 Under such a business model, a new class of "spam brokers" would compete to serve up "good" spam and filter out "bad." Brokers would invite online consumers to register for value-added marketing messages to be matched to their preferences. The broker would protect consumer identities and preferences from less desirable marketers. Mass e-mail messages would go only to those who asked to be solicited, and would be sent through only when the solicitation matched the interests of any particular consumer.
Online advertisers would benefit from superior online audience targeting, while consumers would no longer deal with the barrage of unwanted e-mail.
Given the level of consumer trust required, there are only a few companies with the brand strength and required core competences to pursue the "spam broker" model. One possible group is Internet service providers, with their direct connections to online consumers and experience with e-mail management. Other possibilities include non-Internet businesses such as Disney, with its trusted brand, and longtime reputation for building personal relationships with consumers.
All it takes is for people to feel a strong enough trust-factor to reveal their preferences to an entity that can send them the spam they might actually want, and spare them the junk.
In and of itself, spam, like any other direct-marketing technique, is not a bad thing. Consider that almost 30 percent of a half-hour sitcom on television is given over to commercials. Or that radio stations cram their morning drive shows with commercial breaks that can run about 10 minutes in length - half the average commute. Spam could become a more effective marketing tool than these media if used more judiciously.
Mass marketing in the Internet world is not subject to the same rules and forces as it is in the world of more traditional mass media. There is a nuanced answer to spam than the bill just signed into law. It is time for some entrepreneur to look at this new landscape and find a place for, yes, spam.

FIU Football makes decision to go I-A 



Miami, Fla ( Dec. 4, 2003 ) - Florida International University President Modesto A. Maidique announced over the winter break that the 2-year-old football program will begin its transition from NCAA Division I-AA to I-A in the Sun Belt Conference. 

"Accepting the invitation to go I-A is the right thing to do for the team, for the fans and the university as a whole," said President Maidique. 

"I'm already looking forward to the 2004 season." 

Coach Don Strock, who has been the chief architect of Golden Panther football since the program's approval in 2000, says the team is ready for this new challenge. 

"There are so many positive ramifications to this move," said Strock. 

"Every other sport at FIU is a member of the Sun Belt, and it's a natural for us to join the Conference as a I-A team." 

Maidique said that the decision was reached after months of consultations with the faculty and student leadership, community leaders and members of the FIU Board of Directors and Board of Trustees. 

Athletic Director Rick Mello said this is the correct time to make this move: "This season we played the fourth toughest schedule in I-AA football. 

This team is ready, the time is right."

"Given the recent conference realignments and changes in NCAA guidelines, it is in our best interest to make the move now." 

In order for FIU football to be a full-fledged I-A program by 2006, a 2-year transition phase will begin in the fall of 2004. 

Under NCAA guidelines, Division I-A programs must comply with the following requirements: offer 200 full athletic scholarships (with 85 going to football), field 16 intercollegiate sports, average 15,000 attendance for its home games and play five home games against I-A opponents. 

There are eight football members currently playing in the Sun Belt: Arkansas State, Middle Tennessee, Louisiana-Monroe, Louisiana -Lafayette, North Texas, New Mexico State, Utah State and Idaho. 

Troy State will be joining the Sun Belt next year, but New Mexico State and Utah State will be joining the Western Athletic Conference in 2005. 

Campus Fact: Online spending behavior



Fifty-eight percent of students have made an online purchases, that's up from 51percent last year, 46 percent two years ago and 41 percent three years back. Student expenditures total $1.4 billion. Travel/airline tickets, computers and clothing represent 53 percent of spending.

Headline: Poor financial habits take toll on students' futures
Author: Jennifer F. Lopez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As you step into FIU's Graham Center you cannot help but notice the brightly decorated booths offering free t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately, you stroll by to pick up your "free gift." The gimmick? You must apply for that company's credit card. 

Credit companies lure college students, the largest consumer group of all ages, with free gifts hoping they can be the one's to  partially fund their college life. Young consumers are not often educated on the effects of bad money management or debt. In fact, in our consumer oriented society abusing and mismanaging credit cards is the probably the worst financial mistake a student can make. 

Annel Perez, a junior advertising major confessed that she opened ten credit cards in her freshman year alone. "I had to learn how to manage them efficiently before I fell into deep trouble. I transferred my balances to one credit card, the one with the lowest interest rate." Although Annel learned how to manage her expenses quickly, for many this is not the case. 

A sophomore public relations major, who requested anonymity, said that he owned fifteen credit cards, the majority  cards near their spending limit. The student fell into the temptations of credit card usage and became dangerously in debt at the age of nineteen. He consulted a credit-counseling agency, and with their help he was able to get his financial situation back in control. Little by little, he is paying back his debts but says, "It has not been an easy process."

According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, on average an indebted student who graduated in 2000 had loans totaling $17,7855.

Recent graduates owed an average of $15,000 in 1999/2000, up from $8,200 in 1989/1990.

Among graduating seniors in 1999/2000, two out of three students (67.9 percent) borrowed money for undergraduate degrees.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, students who attend four-year public colleges and universities spend about $8,046 on undergraduate tuition, room and board a year. Students not only have to worry about educational expenses, but loan and credit card debt makes the transition process much more difficult.

 For many students, the college years are the time when they begin to establish financial habits. It is the first time that many are away from home and managing their finances. Once in college, students become instantly responsible for their financial aid, scholarships, loans, tuition, books, food, room, board and other expenses. With the costs of tuition, room and board rising it is no wonder that the percentage of students filing for bankruptcy is climbing as well. 

According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, student loan debt is 85 percent higher among recent college graduates who took on debt while attending public four-year colleges among graduates from a decade ago.

Unfortunately, credit card debt is not the only financial hazard for college students. If you thought applying for college was difficult enough, finding the appropriate funds to attend these colleges and universities can be a challenge on its own. 

Although public universities such as FIU, offer state granted scholarship programs like the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship to cover portions of tuition, many students are left with a percentage of expenses that require help through additional funds. Many students turn to loans, which are funds that collect interest and must be paid back once the student graduates. 

Many students agree that they have a hard time learning "the process" of managing their own finances for the first time.  FIU offers counseling and workshops to cater to student needs such as FIN 3140, an intro course about budgeting, taxes and credit.   This course promises to "help individuals achieve their personal financial goals." For more information about this course you can visit FIU'S business administration website at http://cba.fiu.edu/.

The most important part of it all is that students become educated about managing their money early enough to lead them away from credit disaster.

Headline: Holidays unite families
Author: Becky Bellville/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Spring break is a time for college students to take off with friends to exotic locales. And summer vacations often find them at full-time jobs or internships,or traveling overseas.

Winter breaks, however, do not receive as much attention as other vacations.

Students use this time for overseas travel, staying at home and anything in between, and the length of winter breaks varies from about two weeks off to a luxurious five weeks.

Many students spend this time, which usually starts a week before Christmas and lasts into January, with family and friends.

"I love my winter breaks. I get to hang out with my friends near home and my family after a long drought of not seeing them, which is a huge plus," said Frank Yang, a sophomore at the University of Michigan.

Evan Ewers, a freshman at American University in Washington, D.C., is looking forward to his first trip home since August.

"I'm from California, so it's a really long way," Ewers said. "I'll have my car and I'll be able to see my friends, [who] didn't get to go away to school, and my family."

At Drexel University in Philadelphia, all breaks are about three weeks long.

This is because Drexel's calendar operates year-round, in quarters rather than the traditional semesters.

Eric Flynn, who is in his third year at Drexel, has simple plans for his winter break.

"Absolutely nothing," Flynn said. "Just stay home and enjoy it."

However, not everyone plans to stay home. Philip Dobbyn, director of the Customer Contact Center for the Internet travel service Student Universe, said that while students tend to go home for winter breaks, many also go to warm places like Florida and Cancun, Mexico.

"We try to go somewhere every winter break," said David Ellis, another freshman at American, who plans to go on a Caribbean cruise with his family. "My sister is in graduate school so we both have time off."

Chris Allen, a freshman at Michigan State University, said he may go to California with his family. 

He also said that spending a lot of time with his family was not necessarily positive.

"I like to see them, but I love college so much," Allen said. "They get on my nerves fast."

Some students will use vacations to escape from their families. 

University of Michigan sophomore Nathan Falstad plans to go to the University of Illinois for a five-day conference organized by the group InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, to which he belongs.

"It is nice to go home and spend time with my family, but since I wouldn't be working, two weeks is a long time to spend constantly with your family," Falstad said.

During his last winter break, Michigan student Yang, who is from Massachusetts, went on a ski trip to New Hampshire with friends and plans to do it again.

American University sophomore Izzy Bodian, whose parents recently bought a house in Nicaragua, plans to visit people at the Nicaraguan hotel where she interned last summer. Bodian said she usually spends her breaks in "really weird places," like her high school spring break trip to Paris.

Dobbyn said students often spend part of their winter breaks in Europe, sometimes visiting friends who are studying abroad.

"Students are spending time seeing the sites - and enjoying the lifestyle - of places like London, Paris and Amsterdam," he said. "They've probably done the beers on the beach before, and want a little something different."

However, he said winter breaks  tend to be more low-key than other breaks.

"With spring breaks, the expectations are not to go home, but to go crazy. Winter break has far fewer people traveling in groups, versus summer and spring breaks where students travel together."

Of course, there's always the old standby of using a break to earn money. Ewers, the American University freshman, said he probably would do clerical work for his mother's import-export warehouse over his winter break.

"It's really easy and they pay me, so I don't complain," he said.

Headline: Graduates face rough job market
Author: Christine Martinez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After four years of endless exams and sleepless nights, many college students expect a high paying dream job in their field of study right out of college. However, last year's graduates experienced the most difficult college graduate job market since 1990, due to a weak economy, the fear of terrorism and the war in Iraq.

According to a survey done in Aug. 2002 by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, employers planned on hiring approximately four percent less new college graduates that year. As a result, 20 to 24 year olds had an unemployment rate of 8.9 percent in March of 2003, the second highest in the last six years, according to the Department of Labor Bureau of Statistics.

Employers hired people who needed little or no training in order to cut down on costs, leaving inexperienced and unproven college graduates working odd jobs that had nothing to do with their field of study.

Only about half of all college graduates actually began working in something that was closely related to their major. 

Beatriz Diaz, an education graduate from FIU, was one of the lucky ones. "FIU's school of education helped me find a job through student teaching. I had a job the day after graduation," she said.

What does this mean for future college graduates entering the job market? The good news is that employers are expected to hire 12.7 percent more new college graduates in 2003-04 then they hired in 2002-03, according to a survey conducted by NACE. 

"Graduates from this year are doing better than graduates from a year ago," stated Olga Magnusen, the senior director of FIU's Career Services. Career Services is a department in FIU that   offers career development programs and services for all students, alumni, faculty and employers.

Between the years 2000 and 2010, a 26 percent increase in the number of professional and related jobs is expected, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

The increase will provide 6.9 million jobs to current college students and high school students planning on acquiring a degree.

"Engineering, business, hospitality, health and education are doing very well, the market is improving," Magnusen said. 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that health services, which include home healthcare services, hospital, and doctor's offices, will add 2.8 million new jobs as the demand for healthcare increases due to an aging baby boomer generation and longer life expectations.

Danny Sanchez, a college senior and Health Care Administration major, is not worried about his future. "If I do not get a job right after college, I could get my masters or go into nursing," he said.

On the other hand, job opportunities in scientific and technical fields, with the exception of healthcare, are slimmer than they used to be, according to the NACE.

"Job opportunities are better if the graduate is willing to relocate," Magnusen said. 

Geographic location usually determines salary for certain careers such as marine biology and petroleum engineering, which involve relocating for some areas. High demanding fields such as civil engineering and physical therapy do not require relocating and gives the employee-to-be the leisure of choosing among many job offers.

Internships give students "a foot in the door" by allowing students to make contacts and gain experience, which will put them ahead of the competition. "Internships are great for hands on experience," said Latrell Myers, associate director of FIU's Career Services.

There are many other ways that university students can increase their chances of getting employed right after graduation. 

Attending job fairs and workshops hosted by FIU's Career Services, researching employers and job opportunities and acquiring a positive attitude will prepare college students for the future job market. 

Career Services will be hosting "Mega Career Week," which will be held from Jan. 26 through  Jan. 30, and also from Feb. 2 through Feb. 7.

"Career Services offers employment opportunities for every single major," Magnusen said. "FIU students can sign up for basic services or purchase Golden Panther Services through the FIU website.

 "Career Services networks with national and international employers. The beauty of Golden Panthers Services is that employers call us and ask for resumes with a certain background and the chances of getting a job rises significantly," Magnusen explained.

Headline: "The Return of the King":  Trilogy comes to glorious ending
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
After three years, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy has finally come to its end with "Return of the King," and I feel like such a geek saying this but I almost wish it would go on. Director, Peter Jackson's masterpiece of a vision has a special spot in my heart that will live on forever. 

My family and I even developed a tradition of going to see the new LOTR film every winter, apparently I'm not the only one who found a new familial tradition.  What ever are we going to do next year?

"Return of the King" is a culmination of stories, Frodo and the ring's painful journey to Mordor, his courageous friends who fight for the glory of a peaceful Middle Earth, and the stagnant evil that plagues them. It all comes together in an awesome ending to perhaps the most magnificent film saga of our time.

There isn't much I can say about the film's weakness, if there is any. The acting, like in the previous two LOTR films, is superb. 

Unlike other sagas who throw away potentially interesting character and story development to give us mediocre CGI cartoons,  ("The Matrix", "Star Wars") Jackson's films provide us with plenty of chances to get to know the story, the characters and their struggles.  Enough so that we honestly feel for them and care about their journey. 

Rivaling the darkness of "The Two Towers," "Return of the King" tests the will of our characters by bringing them to their breaking points. Every important character is given a crucial test that will change and effect everything about them. 

Even though the fantasy story of Middle Earth and those who fight for it is very far off from reality, it's something we can all relate to. We are all given tests like this that will change and effect us forever. The structure of the "Lord of the Rings" story is the very story of our own lives, which is what makes it so appealing.

Now that it is over, I can sit and wait for the final Special Edition DVD and all those extra goodies I've been bathing in with the first and second films. 

I've only heard rumors about Jackson doing a "Hobbit" film. At first I was skeptical about this idea but after seeing "Return of the King," I'm all for it. 

The creators of the "Lord of the Rings" films took a big risk and obviously it was well worth it. It is the perfect adaptation for J.R.R. Tolkien's timeless novel series that will perhaps remain timeless itself in film history.

Headline: Prince of Persia pairs puzzle-solving with cool, sleek action
Author: Victor Godinez / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
Don't be fooled by that massive sword on the cover of the box. 

"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'' isn't an action game. Sure, there are action bits thrown in, and you'll chop up zombies and giant beetles like a pro five minutes after you've powered up your console. 

But Ubi Soft's "Prince of Persia'' should really be classified as a brain-buster, because you'll spend far more time plotting a course from one point to the next than slicing up those shambling cadavers. 

"Sands of Time'' ($49; rated for ages 13 and up) is available for the major consoles, Game Boy Advance and the PC. I tried the PlayStation 2 version. 

The original "Prince of Persia'' was released in 1989, and it too was largely a puzzle game, with sword fights tacked on to keep bloodthirsty gamers happy. 

Basically, you're the prince of Persia, and you have to save the princess. Fourteen years later, the story hasn't changed. This time, the graphics are three-dimensional and more impressive than you'd think. You also get funky exotic tunes. 

Your adventure is largely confined to the interior of a castle, but you get to explore huge halls, an indoor zoo, waterfalls, dungeons and hidden passageways. Because the zombies were spawned by the magical Sands of Time, there are all sorts of cool, glittery sand clouds. 

In "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,'' you'll find yourself in sticky situations, such as having to run up a wall to avoid dangerous spikes.

Our hero is equal parts acrobat and ninja, and can swing from ledges, poles and columns. You spend as much time dangling, leaping or rolling as you do running. You can even sprint up the sides of walls for a few seconds, like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'' 

You also possess a magic dagger that can be filled with the demonic sand and used to briefly reverse time. That comes in handy when you've belly-flopped 40 feet straight down onto a bed of pointy spikes. 

At the beginning of each area, there's usually a save point where you can also get a quick vision of the key actions you must perform to get to the next area. The visions don't solve the puzzles for you. They're simply hints. 

And you'll need them later in the game when you have to figure out how to scamper up a wall, jump, grab a pole, twist, toss yourself across the room, flip a switch, scamper through a closing door, dodge rotating spikes, clamber up some rocks and tiptoe across a ledge to the exit. 

That's what most of the levels look like as the combat gets more infrequent. 

But the occasional birds, bugs and chubby zombies do get meaner, and you have to learn nifty combo attacks. Plus, the moves look cool. Every zombie you finish off gives you more sand for your dagger, which lets you slow down time and unlock new attacks. But this is a puzzle game first, and anyone who enjoyed the original "Prince of Persia'' titles should have a blast. 

"Sands of Time'' is a thinking man's "Tomb Raider,'' and that's a good thing.

Headline: Cash lives on with rare, unreleased material
Author: Tom Moon / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Johnny Cash made four albums with producer Rick Rubin in the last decade of his life, but they hardly reflect Cash's output during the period. For the duo's first collaboration, 1994's American Recordings, Cash committed more than 100 songs to tape, and subsequent albums were drawn from equally prodigious amounts of raw material. Rubin says that Cash worked constantly, less concerned with assembling releases than with satisfying his musical curiosity.

The five-disc Unearthed  gathers some outtakes from those acclaimed Grammy-winning releases. It's a trove of living-room demos and studio experiments that didn't quite pan out, long-lost frontier songs Cash recalled on a whim, and rock-era compositions the country legend loved but, until his late-innings resurgence, didn't dare sing. Apart from a disc that surveys the "best" of his American output, the vast majority of the tracks - 64 out of 79 - have never been released before.

Yet Unearthed isn't the usual opportunistic posthumous odds and ends. Its breadth and beauty reinforces the impression created by the official releases that Cash was one of the most devastating interpreters of American popular song ever, a man who infused all he touched with an essential bit of himself, a shred of humanity or humility that most singers are unable (or unwilling) to share.

That's evident on nearly everything here: on a stark, solo "Long Black Veil" and the easygoing soft-shoe "Trouble in Mind," on an unreleased duet with Fiona Apple (Cat Stevens' "Father and Son") and a stunning trip through Bob Marley's "Redemption Song" with Joe Strummer.

While most of the American releases were reserved, if not somber, Unearthed shows that Cash could still rip it up. His deftly synchronized "The Running Kind," with Tom Petty, is a fit of restless energy, while Carl Perkins' jump "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby" and a collaboration with Perkins on Chuck Berry's "Brown-Eyed Handsome Man," recapture the devil-may-care attitude that animated so many Sun sessions.

The set's masterpiece is My Mother's Hymn Book, an entire disc of solo acoustic performances that are among the last things Cash recorded before he died of complications from diabetes in September. On "I'll Fly Away," "I Shall Not Be Moved," and others he first heard his mother, Carrie, sing when he was young, Cash turns oft-shouted songs of resolute joy inward in ways that make clear he is struggling to address questions of his own mortality.

Part of the disc's poignancy comes from knowing that Cash was in declining health, but part of it is his utter absence of affectation: You sense Cash is singing the songs because he draws strength from them, and it's the faith that eludes words that he so graciously shares.

Headline: "Big Fish": Burton scores again with cinematically rich film
Author: Vivian Little / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
"Big Fish" is a delightfully quirky story hinged on a stately plot and heart-aching characters. Tim Burton has created another masterpiece with "Big Fish" to reign among his contemporary classics "Edward Scissorhands" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas." This is one magnificent film due to its vast visual effects and sensitive storyline.

Two men, amiable Albert Finney and charismatic Ewan McGregor, play Edward Bloom. Finney perfects the role of an elder Bloom with his congenial attitude and marvelous tall tales. Everyone who meets Bloom seems infected by his charm, except for his only child, Will, performed by Billy Crudup in what one hopes will be his breakthrough role. Crudup's talent is evident in Will's terse dialogues with Bloom.

Will wishes to bridge the fissure between reality and flights of his father's imagination when he learns of his father's illness. After not seeing his parents in three years, Will returns to his hometown, with pregnant French wife in tow (Marion Cotillard).

Upon his arrival, Will's mother Sandy (the brilliant Jessica Lange) tries to bring her shattered family together. Will refuses to accept his father's fairytales, and searches for some truth to his father's fables, only to learn that some of the most preposterous things in life are true, as long as you believe.

This movie is dazzling with its childish dreams wrapped warmly around adult tribulations. 

Burton stands alone among modern screen visionaries with his ardent eye for detail and marvelous narrative qualities. A tiny town complete with a country fair found in the midst of a flying-spider forest is only one of the mystical place Burton has fashioned. The gorgeous scenery compliments the movie's magical stories, yet never overshadows the humanity of the plot. Burton's film is teeming with creativity and this striking cast only brings out the best of it. Hollywood veterans such as Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi and Helena Bonham Carter add vigor to the characters originally from Daniel Wallace's novel "Big Fish, A Story of Mythic Proportions."

Meticulous descriptions of monsters, witches, giants and criminals could continue for pages upon pages, but my best advice is to see this stunning, poignant film.

Headline: Trilogy reaches grand finale
Author: Barry Koltnow / The Orange County Register
&nbsp;
Four years ago, the phone rang in Viggo Mortensen's home. It was his agent.

"There's this guy in New Zealand who wants to make three movies in a row," the agent said. "If you take the job, you have to leave tomorrow."

Mortensen remembers thinking that it didn't sound like a very good idea. He had never read "The Lord of the Rings," the book upon which the three movies would be based, and he would be walking into an awkward situation. He would be replacing the Irish actor Stuart Townsend, who was fired three days into the shoot when director Peter Jackson realized that he wasn't right for the key role of Aragorn, the man who would be king.

"Not only had the entire cast read the book, but they all had been in New Zealand rehearsing for the last two months," the actor said. "I didn't want the movies to come out and have people say that everybody was into their character but this one guy who didn't seem to know what story he was in."

So, when he hung up the phone, Mortensen was pretty sure he would turn down the offer. Then he turned around and faced his 11-year-old son. His son had overheard the conversation, and already was bouncing with excitement. 

The boy said he had read the book, and assured his father that it was a great story. He urged his dad to take the part, and Mortensen quickly agreed. What father wants to disappoint his young son?

 Mortensen, whose character assumes his rightful throne in the trilogy's finale, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," which opens Wednesday, says now that he's glad he followed his son's advice. The arduous four-year journey was worth it, he said. 

Getting Jackson to say the same thing is not quite as easy.

In a recent interview, the director, who devoted the past seven years of his life to this project, squeezed his head in his hands as if in great pain as he pondered the question: "If you knew then what you know now about how difficult it would be, would you still have done it?" 

After a few moments of intense thought, the director looked up and said, "The answer is yes."

Then he reconsidered.

"I shouldn't say yes. The truth is that I wouldn't have known how I would get through it all, and that may have stopped me. I might have been overwhelmed by the logistical nightmare of making three movies at once. I might have had serious doubts about whether I could pull it off. I think that it might never have happened.

"That is a very hard question to answer."

Indeed, "Lord of the Rings" was a massive undertaking from the moment New Line Cinema gave Jackson the go-ahead to make three films simultaneously, the first time in movie history that a studio had made such a commitment.

While cast members rehearsed, and screenwriters (including Jackson) worked on the more than 400 pages of script, 350 different sets were constructed at 100 locations around New Zealand by a crew that numbered 2,400 at its height. One set alone (the Hobbits' homeland) covered eight acres of farmland.

Originally budgeted at $250 million, the trilogy eventually cost about $420 million, but nobody at the studio is complaining.

 The first two installments - "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers" - have grossed a combined $1.8 billion at the worldwide box office. 

There is no reason to believe that the third movie will be less successful than its predecessors.

"I think the fans will be happy with the third movie," said Jackson, who only put the finishing touches on his 3-hour, 20-minute movie a few weeks ago.

"We kept working on it until we ran out of time. You do the best you can with the time you have, and eventually you run out of time. By then, it ceases to be about money. More money won't improve the film; only time can improve a film."

At seven years, Jackson devoted the longest time to the project, but "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy dominated the lives of the cast and crew for at least four years. And while fans have been waiting anxiously for the third installment, saying goodbye to the project has been a bittersweet experience for the cast.

"You don't understand that we have had all the principal actors back in New Zealand for some re-shooting and we had to go through a farewell scene with each of them. There was a sense of sadness in the air each time we did those scenes, and we did 15 farewell scenes in all.

"If you ask the actors, I'm sure they'll tell you that it was an emotional time for them after all they've been through. Well, imagine going through 15 of those emotional experiences. I'm a wreck."

Elijah Woods, who played the ring-bearer Frodo Baggins in the trilogy, said he is just coming to grips with what he called the "end of the journey."

"This is the first of the three movies that actually says `The End' at the end of the movie, and that really hit me hard. That was a reminder that this part of my life was over. These people are like an extended family to me."

Veteran British actor John Rhys-Davies, who plays the ferocious dwarf Gimli, said the four-year commitment to the trilogy was a "monstrous occupier of time," but had no regrets.

"It has taken up all our lives for the last four years," he said. "Marriages have been made, and divorces have happened in that time.

"But I'm glad I did it. It's an important piece of work. As one grateful fan said to me on the street one day, `This is the "Star Wars" of our generation.'" 

Sir Ian McKellen, who plays the wizard Gandalf, thinks he knows why the trilogy has become this generation's "Star Wars."

"It's a story about good versus evil, but it concentrates on the good people. You don't even see the evil Sauron. 

"It's about people who are up against it, fighting for their homes and families, and they try their best. It is a wonderful concept, and we relate to that concept emotionally because we like the idea of people trying to do the right thing.

"Maybe this should serve as a lesson to Hollywood not to make so many nasty movies about the freakiness of human nature. People don't like films about horrible people. They like movies about good people, and that's why they like "The Lord of the Rings."
