Headline: First students admitted to China campus
Author: Mekala Audain / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
At the end of August 2006, FIU students began the Fall semester, including its students in China. As of this past summer, FIU's Hospitality and Tourism Management Center now has a campus in Tianjin, China.

Although Miami is halfway around the world, the Chinese government invited FIU to build a university in its country nearly two years ago. The government cited said it wanted to do this to modernize its tourism and hospitality facilities - not only to accommodate tourists who have Western standards, but also to prepare for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and its increasing tourist appeal.

"[China's] going to be the number one tourist destination," said hospitality and tourism management major Shaneil Sibblies.

FIU's presence will prove to be an advantage to  students.  Attending FIU in China allows Chinese students to obtain an American university education.

"We take the school there, instead of them coming here," said Associate Dean Lee Dickson, who recently returned from the new center.

There are many differences between the FIU in Miami and the one in China.  In China, all of the students are of the same age group and do not have after-school jobs. In addition, because its dorm can hold 1,000 students, all of its current 313 students live on campus. 

Although the school was officially inaugurated Sept. 15, only one class, Beverage Management, was available to the students over the past summer.

Mohammad Qureshi, adjunct hospitality and tourism management professor and food lab manager, taught this class for three weeks over the summer to 38 juniors.

"I felt more like a pioneer because I was the first teacher from FIU to teach there," Qureshi said.

Qureshi also said that the students had learned English from Scott Kass, the Reader Services Department head at the BBC Library and hospitality and tourism management professor, and that the overall test scores were satisfactory. 

According to Kass, this education will not only serve as a benefit to graduating students entering the Chinese job market, but will also be a positive thing for the Tianjin economy.

"These students will become the tourism management leaders of China. They are going to be members of an elite group in the country," Kass said.

Although this is only the first semester, there are high expectations for FIU's Hospitality and Tourism Management Center in Tianjin.  

"We want it to become the best hospitality and tourism management educational center in Asia," Dickson said.  

This center, however, is not only for Chinese students, but also FIU students in Miami. Making this program available to Miami students is a priority.

"We are expecting a study abroad [program] to begin next Spring," Dickson said.  

The delay is because some internal developments, such as computer labs, food labs and more classrooms, were not completed by the beginning of the Fall semester.

"It's amazing how fast they finished the building," said Sibblies, who went to Tianjin in May to see the center before its completion.

Despite China's Communist government, both Qureshi and Dickson assured that it is safe for American students to attend.

"I would feel safe because it's directly affiliated with FIU," said Zorida Suarez, a hospitality and tourism management master's program student.

Although this center is new, FIU plans to expand programs to other countries in the future. However, there are no concrete plans at this time.

Right now, the primary focus is getting the program exposure in China and Asia.

Headline: New York Times, SJMC offer joint seminars, workshops
Author: Sergio Carmona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU School of Journalism and Mass Communication recently partnered up with The New York Times for a series of events and seminars.

An editing workshop was held Sept. 21 at the Biscayne Bay Campus with three of the paper's editors: Don Hecker, Nicole Collins and Nancy Sharkey.

Around 30 students participated after being nominated by SJMC faculty.

The visiting editors discussed everything from headline writing to the salary of copy editors and important resources for journalists looking for internships or jobs.

The editors were impressed with students who attended the workshop.

"Their skill level was excellent," Hecker, a copy editor at the paper, said. "We've done workshops all over the country, but I think on some issues, the students understood more than any other school."

Although this was the first time that the paper has held the workshop at FIU, they have held similar workshops at other universities, such as Berkley.

The editors mentioned that they would definitely be interested in returning for another editing workshop in the future.

The New York Times has been interested in FIU's journalism school for almost a year.

In fact, The New York Times has selected FIU as the site of its Journalism Institute for student members of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.

The Institute is expected to begin January 2007.

"The quality of the program really attracted us to the university and FIU stood up head and shoulders above anything else," Hecker said.

Hecker also encouraged anyone interested in the Journalism Institute to visit the website at www.nytimes-institute.com.

 Journalism professors have been encouraging students to sign up for these programs, as well as looking for similar opportunities. 

"New York Times is a magic name," said Allan Richards, chair for journalism and broadcasting. "One of the things we as professors do is to inform students about programs, internships, jobs and try to expose them to as many events to broaden their education. I have many students going for the event and it's good for FIU."

The New York Times, though, isn't the only publication with an interest in the SJMC.

The program was given national recognition Sept. 1 after Editor and Publisher magazine, one of the nation's leading trade journals on the newspaper industry, praised the school for its efforts in teaching bilingual and Spanish-language journalism. 

The article was written by Mark Fitzgerald and was titled, "Once little known, Florida International University now takes the lead in training Hispanic journalists."

"The School of Journalism and Mass Communication in FIU is no longer a secret," Richards said. "I feel good about it and it's great and fun."

 In the article, Fitzgerald noted that FIU's Spanish-language journalism master's program was the first in the nation.

He also  pointed out the introduction of a  master's in bilingual journalism, and that the school offers a master's in business journalism.

 "It's enormous for the school," Richards said. "Editor and Publisher magazine is considered the bible and the quote, 'Once little known university,' says it all."

Students interested in applying to the Journalism Institute must be NAHJ members, have completed one semester at a student newspaper or major newspaper, be in good academic standing and write a 500-word essay about being a journalist.

For more information, students can visit http://www.nytimes-institute.com/howtoapply.html.

Headline: Institute offers lifelong learning
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Before Dorothy Harris retired last November from her position as a business manager in a neurosurgeon's office, she could understand some Spanish but could not speak the language. After retiring, though, she began searching for a part time job only to find employers seeking bilingual candidates.

Like many others, Harris decided to enroll in basic Spanish, one of the many classes being offered at the Osher Lifelong institute.

The institute provides students over the age of 50 the opportunity to learn in a short period of time without having to be concerned about tests, much less grades.

"I thought [learning Spanish] was an important thing for me to get out of the way if I ever wanted to do anything again," Harris said. 

The institute, which began operating as the Osher Lifelong institute this past summer after being awarded a $100,000 dollar grant by the Bernard Osher foundation, has been offering various Fall classes including "Understanding Antiques," "E-mail Skills and the Internet" and "A Psychological Perspective on Foreign Films," among others, since Sept. 11.

Classes such as "Basic Computers" and "Writer's Workshop" will be offered during the Fall B term between Oct. 30 and Dec. 15, including other courses with topics such as "Is God a Democrat or Republican?"

Contrary to Harris, who decided to enroll in a Spanish class for work purposes, Carole Dimaio, a former accountant for The Sports Authority Company who is now retired, decided to take the "Basic Spanish" class to help prepare for her upcoming trip to Mexico.

"We're going to be going to Mexico and it would be nice to be able to negotiate a little bit and to know what's going on," Dimaio said.

Other students such as Minerva Andino, a nursing assistant who retired a year ago, decided take the "E-mail skills and Internet" course to get  up-to-date with the ever changing technology.

"I'm learning e-mail and Internet to get busy and do something constructive, you know. That's really what it is and I would like to learn the new technology before I die," Andino said with a laugh.

Reaping the benefits from such programs comes at a price, but not a high one, especially if the student is a member of the institute.

"Students can become a member with a membership fee of $25 for the entire year and when they become a member, then they get $20 off per course, which is roughly $15 per week," said Susan Jay, director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and Continuing and Professional studies.

The program, which has been running for over 20 years, was formerly known as the Academy for Lifelong Learning and prior to that, it was known as the Elders' Institute.

"When [the college of continuing and professional studies] took over the program, I changed the name from Elders' Institute to Academy for Lifelong Learning. The participants were very happy about that because they certainly liked the idea of being part of a lifelong learning program much more than being part of an elders' program," Jay said.

"Our students don't like any of the connotations that come with getting old and that's why you really won't find any courses in here that deal with aging."

Headline: How to...a humor column
Subheadline: Looking smart despite the reality
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
More often than not, it's important to look more appealing than you actually are. Prospective suitors, job interviewers, loan and later parole officers all rely on a good impression of you to judge your worthiness. It's too often that we have one shot to impress people, and since plastic surgery prices aren't likely to fall soon, you have to rely on your charm (what little you have) and intelligence (which makes your charm look like the twin that survived).

Therefore, in order to get through these difficult social situations, you have to lie. Well, if you don't like lying, you have to "play pretend" that you're actually smart. If you don't, you'll never get a date with that bookish raven-haired hottie from Starbucks (call me).



The look



The proper "smart" costume can overcompensate if you're shy, mute or have a voice like Gilbert Gottfried (I'd prefer to be mute). Start with anything ironed. Smart people love starched shirts. You can also add flair with maybe a blazer or anything corduroy and you'll look like you came straight from the cover of an Ivy League school's catalog.

Another option is to wear an item of clothing from another culture. You can show up to a party in a kilt and tell your peers you're exploring complex fashion choices of your heritage - then whip out a bagpipe.

Additional accessories: cup of overpriced coffee and an ethnic friend.



The walk



Smart people don't necessarily have a swagger, but they carry themselves with a confidence that says, "I know the capital of French Guiana." In any case, you have to walk like you have a purpose. If you furrow your brow while you walk, people will think you're contemplating the world's problems. Don't look too occupied, though, or people will think you have an intestinal problem to solve. 

The capital's Cayenne, by the way. I didn't know either.



The talk



The most important part of feigning intelligence is to gauge when to open your fat mouth. Since smarties are usually choosy with their words, you should cap yourself to about three interjections a conversation. Make them vague, but have a stance. Smart people have defined ideals and opinions. Here are some examples. For politics: "The next administration will have a fun time cleaning that mess up"; for science: "the developments have been fascinating but farfetched"; for music: "I think the album is just another gasp for air in a genre that's slowly dying." That should cover you on current events that you neither know nor care about.

If you're running out of ideas for topics of chitchat, it's good to keep several Trivial Pursuit cards in your pocket for emergencies. Did you know that the male mosquito only lives a week?



The Backfire



Sometimes trying to look smart can completely backfire on you. When talking with the air of an expert, especially in a group of people in the know, you need to have some basis of knowledge - because when you don't, you look like a jerk. 

As an example, I'll tell you the true tale of a co-worker (unlike the usual web of lies I spin for you each week). We had an employee here at The Beacon (let's call her Lady Ladyson) who would often make it a point to mention how well read she was. One of us became wise to this deception and one day, in the usual rundown of conversation of what books we've read, he mentions the "Necronomicon." This co-worker then goes off on how illuminated she was by this book. Now, for those of you who don't know, this "Necronomicon" is a nonexistent book containing occult ideas cited in the horror short stories of H.P Lovecraft. To this day, "pulling a Ladyson" is an example of being caught in a lie that evokes pity/ridicule.

The moral of the story: know your audience. Don't go into an art crowd and mention how much you enjoy Picasso's tangerine/ orange period.

With these vital tools and techniques you can get through any situation where you have to impress. I mean, it beats actual learning. Good luck.

FIU:
FIU, other universities receive $1.4 million grant

The W. K. Kellogg Foundation approved and funded a joint proposal with several Florida universities worth more than $1 million.

FIU, University of South Florida, Florida Atlantic University and the University of Central Florida are part of the agreement in the amount of $1,382,568, which will be distributed over three years to support Engaging Latino Communities for Education.

Higher pay, full benefits for janitorial positions

According to a statement released Sept. 27, janitors at the University will be eligible for salary increases of almost 50 percent and access to health care under a new plan to make the janitorial staff positions in-house.

Most of those workers started at $6.40 an hour, but the new in-house positions will be set at $9.58 an hour, the federal living wage.

Workers will have access to the same health care plans offered to all other employees of the University, and will be represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Headline: New Fuels: All Hype, No Hydrogen
Subheadline: Politicians should focus on realistic alternatives, not fantasy cars
Author: Krystian Moreno / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Seldom do we associate the terms "visionary" or "innovative" with the politicians that make up our government. In today's world where sound bites, press releases and photo opportunities are the bulk of what we hear out of Washington, we find very little dissension on a theme like the hydrogen economy.

When going on the record about solutions for our current energy crisis, we hear politicians from all sides rave about the future role hydrogen will play in our economy. Sure, the possibilities of hydrogen lead us into an entirely different world, but what if that world never arrives?

The idea of running our cars and powering our world on the universe's most abundant resource can be captivating to the imagination, but at this stage in the game the hydrogen economy has about as much chance of coming into fruition as do teleportation or flying cars.

You don't hear the politicians shouting that from the hilltops. The energy politicians invest in creating hoopla about hydrogen would be put to better use by creating and implementing policies that bolster awareness and support for more promising alternative fuel sources such as cellulosic ethanol - a way of creating viable fuel from refuse - and hybrid cars.

Not only are there questions about the true environmental benefits of hydrogen - the vast majority of hydrogen production comes from natural gas and coal - but there are also serious questions as to the economic viability of creating, transporting and distributing it.

With today's inadequate technology and high consumption rates hydrogen would be about four times as expensive as gasoline at the pump, untaxed, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Billions more will be needed to build the necessary distributing infrastructure.

There are cars on the road today that run on hydrogen, but creating a hydrogen powered car is only the tip of the iceberg. The real problem is finding a way to take oil out of the equation and replace it with hydrogen in a cost-effective, environmentally conscious manner that won't make the whole system go boom.

The real problem does not lie in manufacturing an archetype of a "green automobile," it lies in getting that automobile into the hands of American drivers. It requires doing away with 100 years of infrastructure surrounding the internal combustion engine and replacing fuel stations, tanker trucks and even mechanics. This won't be easy.

To understand the scope of the changes involved in implementing the economy of the future, you must first understand the role played by fossil fuels in our current economy.

Everything we use in today's world requires fossil fuels at some stage of production, especially where the transportation and energy sectors are involved. No matter what your opinion of them, fossil fuels are an economically vital resource. They may pollute our air and water, contribute to the greenhouse effect and create trying geo-political situations, but civilization itself would come to a screeching halt without them.

This makes the lure of hydrogen ever more seductive. Imagine a world where all our transportation and energy needs could be provided leaving behind only clean, drinkable water+. The environmental and economic ramifications of a transition away from oil would be immeasurable. 

Unfortunately, even conservative estimates place hydrogen at least 20 to 25 years away from having any significant impact on global energy demands. 

With the supply of cheap oil diminishing and our planet warming at an alarming rate, time is not on our side. We need to find a solution to the world's energy needs to liberate us from the bindings of our current oil addiction; the geopolitical calamities and environmental havoc rooted in fossil fuels will only continue to worsen as time passes. It is time our politicians stop producing sound bites and start producing solutions.

Subheadline: Excellence comes to those who 'labor'
Author: Rocio Perez / SGA Honors College Representative / Junior
&nbsp;
"Excellence therefore, is not an act but a habit." Aristotelian misquotations aside, it used to be that we studied in order to broaden our horizons, to challenge our preconceptions, and to get beyond the narrow confines of our present-day culture. 

Some consider that unfair. Please, have some cheese with your whine! 

Fortunately for the students at FIU, there's an institution that actually defends the integrity of education. The Honors College at FIU may be accused of being "elitist," but it is ludicrous to claim that they measure excellence through "really high GPA's!" 

We're all pretty talented at spewing empty intellectual rhetoric. Honors students might agree that it's a necessary skill. Yet, however eloquent it may be, it's never fared well when standing up to hard facts.

The facts are that the Honors College, as well as its faculty and staff, tirelessly promote six separate skills in their students: interdisciplinary knowledge, strong analytical skills, engagement in research collaborations, mentoring and internship experiences, responsible civic engagement, and an appreciation for the individual person. 

Most importantly, they succeed in fostering a sense of community among the students as individuals with unique talents and responsibilities to the self, the community and society. 

The Honors College accomplishes all six aims with excellence, in every sense of the word. You can't beat that, brother! 

Furthermore, the vast majority of Honors College students work part time, get involved in extracurricular activities, and still find time for their family, friends, and community! Despite all this, they maintain at least a 3.3 GPA - I think their ability to keep their priorities straight is what's really excellent, impressive and praiseworthy.

An even deeper truth is that the Honors College not only cares for our success, but also does everything it can to guarantee it. This includes fighting so you can keep your scholarship, awarding you with a computer so you can do your schoolwork, or distinguishing you for your superior talents.

Knowledge and integrity are indispensable to a successful future.

The Greeks got it right in believing that "every man a man, every woman a woman, every person a person, but naught without labor." 

The Honors College believes students are capable of achieving excellence. It just takes a little labor.

Headline: LEADER OF THE PACK
Subheadline: Senior quarterback has hope in final season
Author: Jannel Palenzuela / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As a freshman, Josh Padrick was not supposed to be the starting quarterback for the FIU football team. But when injuries pushed him to starting duty, everything was changed.

Completing nearly 50 percent of his passes, Padrick was named FIU's Most Valuable Player during his first season as a Golden Panther. That same year he became the first FIU quarterback to throw for over 300 yards in one game; he passed for 370 yards against nationally-ranked I-AA Georgia Southern. He also had 12 touchdowns that year, including a couple of three-touchdown games against Georgia Southern and Jacksonville.

However, the 6'3" senior quarterback from Merritt Island, Fla., admits that he was not very confident when he first stepped into the starting role.

"I was a little nervous [about starting] at first," Padrick said. "It was a different offense and the game was faster."

Padrick remained the starting quarterback and continued to improve as a sophomore during the 2004 season. He became the first Golden Panther to pass for more than 4,500 career yards. That same year, Padrick also improved his percentage of completions to 56.7 percent and his passing efficiency to 113.74. He had back-to-back games with 27 completions versus nationally-ranked Georgia Southern - where he also completed nine consecutive passes - and Western Kentucky. He threw touchdown passes in eight of 10 games finishing the year with 12 touchdowns, including four games with two scoring passes. 

"He has only continued to get better every year," said coach Don Strock. "He improves every game."

During the 2005 season as a junior, Padrick was named a second-team All-Sun Belt Conference quarterback that ranked at the top in passing yards per game, averaging 223.7 per game. He was ranked second in total offense (224.8), and second in passing efficiency (122.6). 

Before the season was over, he totaled 82 yards on 15 rushes, averaging 5.4 yards per carry with 3 touchdowns. 

Padrick also completed 221-of-366 passes for 2,461 yards, making this year his third consecutive season with more than 2,000 passing yards. He threw touchdown passes in nine of 11 games and passed for 324 yards in a win over Western Kentucky. 

Although many other programs, such as North Carolina-Greensboro and the University of Central Florida, were initially impressed with Padrick's numbers in high school - he passed for over 1,300 yards his senior year -  Padrick chose to become a Golden Panther.

"It was mainly the coaches that I wanted to play for," Padrick said. "I knew [assistant coach Hurlie] Brown from high school and FIU, at the time, was a starting program. I thought it would be great to help start it."

As expected, the team would have to battle through some rough outings the first couple of years. But the team knew that they always had another chance to redeem themselves.

"That's the good thing about football," Padrick said. "Every week you get another chance to play a new team, do better and prove yourself."

When the team is faced with a tough situation or loss, Padrick knows it is important to stay as calm as possible and tries to give his teammates confidence throughout the game.

Before game time, many athletes go through some kind of routine, whether in the locker room or on the field. For Padrick, it is just a certain way of stretching or a particular food.

Whatever it is that Padrick does to prepare himself, before a game or during practice, Strock believes it's working.

 "He's really got a grasp of the offense and that's why we give him a leeway in changing the plays," Strock said. "He only wants to get better, as does the rest of the team."

Off the field, Padrick realizes that without his family's constant support he may have never reached the level of play he is currently in. His coaches and teammates have helped him throughout the seasons as well.

"[The coaches] teach me about the defense and have helped me become a better player," Padrick said. "My teammates have helped me become a better person and a better man. I really enjoy hanging out with the team."

Although it is his last year as a Golden Panther, Padrick does not seem to be letting up, despite a rough start this year at 0-4. Winning the conference for the team, the seniors and the coaches is his main focus.

During the first four games of the season, he has 736 passing yards with a 101.92 passing efficiency.

As for the much-anticipated FIU and University of Miami game Oct. 14 at the Orange Bowl, Padrick realizes that this is a great game for the program and that the team has to prepare to play against a school like UM.

"We're going to give it our all," Padrick said. "But there is another two weeks left and we need to prepare like we do for every other school. [UM] is a great team, but right now we have to focus on this week and winning the conference."

Headline: Tragedy inspires player's decision to coach
Author: Renaldo Smith / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
While playing professional basketball overseas two years ago, Joanne Aluka-White had to deal with the most disappointing news in her life - her father's death.

Ironically, it was that great loss that played an instrumental part in her traveling along the road of coaching, a path that has recently led her to the bench of the women's basketball team.

According to Aluka-White, she realized she had more than a knack for coaching during the time-off she took after her father's death.

"While I was overseas playing basketball, I had a great experience," Aluka-White said. "It was kind of a bittersweet situation because my father was sick and, about three months after I played in the Olympic Games, my father passed away." 

Following the death of her father, Aluka-White took a year off from basketball to settle some things with her mother.

"I have always been interested in coaching and during that year I coached camps over the summer and became an assistant coach at Hephzibah High School [in Augusta, Ga.]," Aluka-White said. "I would say, during that year, I saw that I really wanted to work with young ladies and open doors for them."

The 27-year-old recently opened a new chapter in her life by getting married this past summer and is now looking forward to a new and exciting start as Golden Panther assistant coach.

After a successful four-year stint at Middle Tennessee State University - where she obtained her M.S. in sports management and served as graduate teachers assistant in the school's athletic department - Aluka-White went overseas to compete play basketball in Portugal.

Still eager to go further with her basketball career, the native Nigerian seized the opportunity to participate for her home country's national squad at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece before a short stint with the Dallas Fury in the National Women's Basketball League.

Now that she has landed her first big coaching gig at FIU - where her responsibilities will include assisting with recruiting, on-floor game and practice coaching, promotions and camps - Aluka-White says she is looking forward to gaining as much knowledge as she can from team coach Cindy Russo, who she believes has a wealth of experience and knowledge, and will do everything that she can to better the team.

"[Russo] has been here almost 30 years and she has always had a good team so I couldn't imagine going somewhere else," said Aluka-White. "I am coming here because I know that I am going to learn from one of the best in women's basketball ... I just want to gain more experience and learn about coaching women's basketball."  

  She firmly believes that the team has a lot of talent and potential for the upcoming season.

"I think hat we have an opportunity to make it to the NCAA tournament," Aluka-White said.

Besides looking foward to the upcoming season, White looks foward to getting to know the team better.

"Off the court, they are a great bunch of girls who are very respectful and hardworking. On the court, I can see that they are hungry for it and they want to do well and whatever we can bring to give them in practice they are ready for it,"Aluka-White said. "The girls know that, even [though] I am older, it wasn't that many years ago that I was going to school and I have been through what they are going through now."

Aluka-White joins former University of Miami standout Desma Thomas, who will also serve as an assistant under coach Russo this coming season.

Headline: Girardi's expected firing premature, uncalled for
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
This is all so freaking childish.

I would have thought that people would have learned how to play nice in grade school, but I guess Florida Marlins' owner Jeffery Loria and the rest of the Marlins' executives must have been taking a nap at the time.

Not even the average 25-year-old Marlins players bicker like this.

From the moment Marlins manager Joe Girardi was hired to lead this year team, with a $15 million payroll and comprised of 22 rookies, he was on the hot seat.

Loria hired Girardi without even consulting with General Manager Larry Beinfest, who was the architect that brought in all the talent this year and kept this bargain basement team competitive over the past couple of years.

Both parties have huge egos and disagreed on player personnel and how the team should be run.

Beinfest was never high on Girardi and a nasty fight between management and Girardi, following a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 6, sealed his fate.

What I find strange is why Loria wasn't questioning Girardi's moves or filled with rage when the team's record was 11-31 in May?

A couple of months ago, Loria was in love with Girardi and now they can't even speak with one another. Talk about a marriage gone bad.  

Nobody expected anything from this team. Baseball writers thought the 2006 Marlins would lose more than 100 games.

The only person that had different expectation from his players was Girardi. 

He kept the team loose and focused when the time called for it and he is the perfect fit for this club. 

His cool demeanor, which he picked up while watching New York Yankees manager Joe Torre  in 2005, proved vital to this season.

Both parties are willing and eager to separate already. Girardi will move on to a team where he will be properly appreciated and the Marlins will be able to hire a manager they will be able to control. 

And the loser in the middle of this soap opera will be Marlins fans.

Within the 13 years of the Marlins' existence, fans have enjoyed two World Series championship parades, gone through two fire sales and now witnessed an owner run off a great manager who won the hearts of fans.

There is no possible way for Loria to spin this positively.

Even from the get go, Girardi came in here thinking he was going to have Carlos Delgado batting clean up, Josh Becket striking out batters every fifth day and the rest of  the $60 million team that barely missed the playoffs in 2005.

Instead, he's been given the same treatment South Florida has received from the Marlins' organization.

Cold fish.

With behavior like this, Loria and the other Marlins executives shouldn't have to wonder why South Florida hasn't embraced their franchise.

Headline: Seniors receive honors
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Two seniors on the football team received national honors this week.  Linebacker Keyonvis Bouie was selected to participate in the Las Vegas All-American Classic and wide receiver Chandler Williams was put on the watchlist for the Biletnikoff Award, which is awarded annually to the nation's best college receiver.

Bouie is the first Golden Panther to be named to a collegiate post-season All-Star game. 

As of Sept. 29, Bouie leads the Golden Panthers with 41 tackles - 29 solo and 7.5 tackles for loss -  and has also recorded two sacks.

The Las Vegas All-American Classic will take place Jan. 15 at the home of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels - Sam Boyd Stadium. 

The game features two teams of 50 players - one representing the east and one representing the west - and will be televised on the NFL Network.

Prior to the game, players get to participate in practices and combines open to scouts for professional teams.

"[Bouie] could get invited to other all-star games as well and I'm sure several other of our players will be selected to some of these all-star games, too," said coach Don Strock in a press release. "Congratulations to him. It's an honor to be the first from our program to be accepted to an All-Star game.

 "It means we're going out and attracting some talented players."

Williams is one of 50 finalists in Division I-A for the award, which is named after former Florida State and Oakland Raiders' wide receiver Fred Biletnikoff and is awarded annually by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club.

As of Sept. 29, through FIU's first four games this season, Williams has caught a total of 26 passes for 294 yards and has averaged 73.5 yards receiving per game and 6.5 receptions per games.  

He leads the Sun Belt Conference in all those categories and is ranked 11th in the nation in receptions per game.

The Biletnikoff Award recipient will be announced at the ESPN College Football Awards Show in December at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.

Headline: Nanotechnology improves medicine, computers
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
A group of researchers at FIU's Engineering Campus are currently making advances in nanotechnology - breakthroughs that can one day help humans live better and create computers with larger storage capacities, according to the researchers.

Funded by grants from the Office of Navy Research, the National Science Foundation and other contributors, researchers at the facility are working towards advances in technology through the use of nanotechnology.

Nanotechnology works with particles and devices at the nano-scale, which is between one to 100 nanometers.

A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter.

Devices of this size are fabricated at the facility using high-tech equipment, including transmission electron microscopes that can magnify up to a billion times the vision of the human eye.

When entering the Motorola Nanofabrication Facility, a 2,000 sq. ft. facility located on the Engineering Campus, team members must put on special gowns designed for the clean room facility. The room has to be free of any dust and other particles that can contaminate experiments.

The lab has an anti-vibration floor and the equipment is reinforced so as not to sense any vibration, which can also hurt the experiments. 

The projects often involve professors from different fields including material science, biomedical engineering and electrical engineering; they work on applications for computers, biomedical sensors and improving materials.

One of the recent breakthroughs came from Arvind Agarwal, assistant professor for the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and his team of researchers. They found a way to improve the coating of biological implants such as joint replacements in the body. The coating on these metal implants can become brittle and begin to dissolve inside the body.

Agarwal sprayed the coating material with small nanoparticles, which strengthened the coating, making it less brittle. Agarwal's research also looks into building up larger structures from small nanoparticles. He believes that through this process stronger materials can be designed that would be cheaper to produce. 

Government agencies such as NASA and the U.S. Air Force have also sponsored some of Agarwal's research.

Getting money for research is never easy, Agarwal said. 

"The success rate for getting funds is less than 10 percent. For every ten grants applied for, I'll maybe get one," Agarwal said. "The process can become very time consuming."

Agarwal can sometimes spend up to 80 hours a week between teaching classes and researching his projects. When asked about how much time he spends working Agarwal laughed. "There is no number."

When professors send out applications for grants, the Office of Sponsored Research Administration handles the money received.

Doctoral student Xuan Wang is involved in experiments at the facility and in the testing of devices. "It can be exciting when you are trying to identify a problem and then find a solution, you have to test and re-test your results," he said.

Roberto Panepucci, a professor for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering researches heat-assisted magnetic recording devices that could improve computer storage beyond the current limits. His work also involves working with optics to improve the speed of communications. 

Panepucci likes what is being done. 

"FIU research is positioned to continue pushing the state of the art," Panepucci said.

He tries to go to the lab almost every day to work on his main projects. Panepucci also has a team of four full-time graduate students working on his projects who spend about 20 hours a week inside the lab.

Devices are designed on computers and simulated, fabricated using lab equipment, and then characterized and tested. 

"I like knowing that I am adding to the knowledge in the field, and other researchers can build on what we have done," said Patricia Fievre, a doctorate student in electrical engineering.

Headline: Professor among finalists for award
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
The National Society of Collegiate Scholars has announced their top 10 finalists for their Faculty of the Year Award and FIU's  Marcia Magnus, an associate professor of dietetics and nutrition, is among the top 10.	

The NSCS is an honors organization based in Washington D.C. that, according to its web site at NSCS.org, recognizes first and second-year students for outstanding academic achievement.

The faculty of the year program was first introduced in 2004. 

The winner receives a $1000 stipend and $5000 donated in his or her name to a scholarship fund for his or her university.

Magnus was one of a thousand professors nominated for the award. 

"I was nominated anonymously by a student," Magnus said. "So there is no way for me to know who nominated me. But I was delighted when I found out I reached the top 10."

Magnus was notified Sept. 20 that she was in the top 10, but when she was first told she had made the initial group of 1000 nominees, she reacted in a unique way.

"I had never heard of the group before, so I threw the documents they sent me away," Magnus said. 

Later that afternoon Magnus was congratulated by then-department head Dian Weddle. 

"After the department head came, I took the documents out of the garbage," Magnus said. 

The current dietetics and nutrition department head, Fatma Huffman, believes that the nomination alone will be extremely beneficial to FIU.

"This is quite an honor for Dr. Magnus," Huffman said. "I think if she wins that it will really put FIU and our program on the map." 

Magnus' students are happy with their teacher's nomination and agree that this was something she deserved.

"She is absolutely amazing," said graduate student Staci Shacter. "She is one of the best professors I've ever had. The passion she brings into the class really helps people understand."

"She is one of those teachers that encourages you to take your experience from class out into the community," said junior Bidlose Olivier. "We went to the Camillus House recently and served food to the homeless as part of an extra credit assignment."

According to LaToya Drake, a representative from the NSCS, these are the qualities that got Magnus into the top ten tier.

"Behind each exceptional scholar stands at least one extraordinary educator, and this year's finalist have a passion and dedication to academic excellence that places them in an elite class," Drake said in a press release. "This year, Dr. Marcia H. Magnus from Florida International University ranks among the best." 

The official winner of the NSCS's Faculty of the Year award will be announced Nov. 1.

Magnus, who has taught at FIU since 1991, has remained humble to the notion she may win the award throughout the nomination process.

"My students are my first priority," Magnus said. "If I don't win, then the NSCS missed an opportunity to celebrate with me. But this kind of activity is great. It's good to know someone thinks you are doing a good job."

Headline: Cuba expert addresses island's political future
Author: Christopher Lazaga / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Is a free Cuba feasible or possible at all? Frank O. Mora, professor of international studies at Rhodes College, is not very optimistic.

Mora spoke on behalf of "Between Fidel and Raul," a lecture sponsored by the Cuban Research Institute addressing the future of Cuba at the end of Fidel Castro's leadership. Mora opened his presentation with remarks on the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba released by the U. S. government in July 2006.

His argument is that the CAFC II report is fundamentally flawed.

The report assumes a crucial dynamic required for a movement toward democracy exists. According to Mora, it exists at an insufficient level.

In the 50s, Fidel Castro led a small group of rebels against Cuban president Fulgencio Batista. Castro and his rebels, calling themselves Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (Revolutionary Armed Forces),  succeeded in overthrowing Batista's regime. Following Castro's revolution, Cuba  turned into a totalitarian government.

Mora believes Castro's regime drastically changed after the fall of the Soviet Union.

"Castro dubbed this time span the Special Period," Mora said. "To ensure that his reign over Cuba continued undisturbed, he tightened his hold by re-mobilizing the FAR to take care of most operations: civil, economic and military."

The result was a small elite class made up of military officers and government members, many of whom fought alongside Castro during the revolution. An overwhelmingly large lower class made up of the rest.

"The crucial dynamic for change [in Cuba] is the strength of civil society force versus the strength and degree of cohesiveness of the regime," Mora said.

In order for change to occur, there must be sufficient cracks and fissures within the government in power, he said. 

"These cracks manifest themselves as unrest among government or military officials or defections of those in power to the opposing force," Mora said.

This, coupled with a strong civil society with a true yearning for democratic freedom, is essentially the recipe for change.

The key is for unrest among those in power to give space for the people to mobilize against them. 

Unfortunately for Cubans, in the eve of Castro's life, his regime remains strongly united and the people remain collectively weak and oppressed, according to Mora. 

An advantage is that Castro's successor and  younger brother Raul Castro cannot rule like the dictator; he lacks the charisma and general pull of the revolution's originator. Raul's form of leadership must therefore be different. 

Mora said the younger Castro can choose one of two paths: he can respond to the people's needs to obtain favor or he can further oppress them to prevent any sort of uprising. Either way, he won't have much time.

"Raul Castro will not remain in power for long. He is very old. So are the rest of those who fought in the revolution fifty years ago," Mora said.

Headline: Campus walk sheds light on safety
Author: Yesenia Forte / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Dark. Desolate. Dangerous. 

For some students at University Park, that's what the campus can become at night.  

Director of Public Safety Bill L. King met with student representatives Sept. 27 to walk around UP and discuss students' safety concerns.

Wolfgang Acevedo, the student services chair for the Student Government Council at UP, led the walk around campus, which started in the Housing Quad at 7 p.m. He was joined by SGC-UP President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon and a handful of students.

The meeting was scheduled at night so that King could see first hand why they believe the campus is unsafe after dark, Leon said.

"The main concern is insufficient lighting," Acevedo said. 

He suggested more lighting be added, especially throughout the Housing Quad and on the path to the Recreation Center.

"If we could have the same lighting that was installed around Lakeview throughout campus it would be great."

The bulbs in the new light posts that surround the Lakeview housing building are whiter and brighter than bulbs used elsewhere on campus.

Almost all the light posts give off a yellowish and dim light. Some of the lights, such as the ones behind the Ryder Business building, don't turn on at all and others turn on hours after darkness falls.

"Lighting doesn't really fall under Public Safety, but at the same time, those poorly lit areas are of concern as far as patrolling," King said. 

He encouraged Acevedo to contact  the facilities operations and maintenance department to discuss those issues.

Walking past the nature preserve behind the baseball stadium, Acevedo also addressed the wild dogs that often roam the campus and seem to be living in the preserve.

"We are concerned about someone getting bit," King said. "But there are also students and faculty feeding them." 

King said they were looking into fencing off that area, leaving only limited access.

Throughout the walk, Acevedo also tested a few emergency call boxes to make sure they were in working condition. Although they were all functional, King said the call boxes are hardly ever used.

"Call boxes are fine," he said. "But almost everyone has a cell phone and that is going to be closer to you than any call box."

Acevedo also mentioned the lack of security in Lot Six and said there have been several reports of cars being broken into.

"We have made some arrests of people who are not students coming on campus and messing with cars," King said. "But our statistics are not showing the same numbers of cars are being broken into."

He said the explanation for that is idle talk. If one person's car window is broken and he tells two people, then those two people tell others. Soon, 10 people are talking about it, and it's not that 10 cars were broken into, but that they're  all talking about the same car, King said.

"Don't leave items in cars in plain sight," King said. "And if you have a car that's been broken into, come to us and report it."

Headline: SGA delays changing constitution until Spring elections
Author: Cristela Guerra / BBC Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Major changes to the Student Government Association's constitution were delayed during a meeting of the SGA University Wide Council, a decision council members said would give students more time to understand what those modifications would entail.

SGA is broken into two councils, one for each campus. They come together at least once a month as the UWC, which is comprised of the presidents, vice presidents, comptrollers and speakers of the houses from both Student Government Councils. Their latest meeting was Sept. 29 at the Campus Life office in the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Although SGC-UP President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon mentioned on Sept. 27 that he was confident the changes would be ratified Sept. 29, a motion was passed to table the issue. This caused a possible student vote to be moved to the spring elections instead of the upcoming special elections Oct. 22.

The vote was unanimous and Leon said the delay was for the "benefit of the student body."

"We can't expect students to vote on something when they've only had five seconds to review them. We want them to be informed, not deter them," Leon said.

The constitution has conflicting information regarding approval of its changes. Article 9, part B, number 7, says that the UWC can propose amendments by a 3/4 vote to later be ratified by a majority of student votes in the election. However, article 15 states that only a 2/3 vote is necessary by the UWC.  

Leon said that the UP judicial board stayed up until midnight at their last meeting working on the constitution's potential changes.

Some of these changes involve the vice-president's position and specific duties required of him or her, specifically his or her participation in other meetings and committees. The vice president currently receives a vote on issues brought up to the house or representatives. This means the executive branch is involved in legislative duties such as voting on appropriations, bills and resolutions. The constitution, though, mentions that a separation of powers enforced by the judicial board is supposed to exist.

Another potential change would make the population of undergraduate and graduate students in each campus determine the amount of each school or college's representatives within a council.

At some point next semester before the vote takes place, students would potentially receive a summarized or abstract form of the constitution with the major changes highlighted. A website would show  students the entire SGA constitution in it's redeveloped format.

"We can be ready by January to have info sessions held in housing as well as town hall meetings to let the students have the opportunity to review the changes and provide input," Leon said.

Another issue discussed was in reference to the judicial board affecting bylaws during the special elections. In addition to the constitution, each council is governed by separate bylaws that dictate duties specific to their campus.

"Each campus is different in its bylaws; it depends on each of our needs," said SGC-BBC President Camilo Silva.

"We've already been updating bylaws specifically for the judicial board at BBC and hope to have them completed soon," said Gabriel Labrador, speaker of the house for SGC-BBC.

The councils agreed that each campus has the right to their own set of bylaws regarding policy in their specific area, but a standard constitution should pertain to both.

Headline: College of Medicine gets official name
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The FIU College of Medicine finally received a name amid great applause and fan-fare during a meeting held by the Board of Trustees Sept. 29.

In a unanimous vote, the board agreed upon the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine of FIU as the new name.

The decision was made in the Wolfe University Center's Ballroom at the Biscayne Bay Campus. In attendance were guests, faculty and students, with 30 mock-up ads around the room set up to promote the college.

Other issues presented at the meeting included the proposal to develop a student support complex and an expanded football stadium, both on the University Park campus. However, the most highlighted proposal was the naming the College of Medicine.

Armando Guerra, a board trustee, was asked by University President Modesto A. Maidique to make a nomination for the College's name.

"I'm very honored and grateful for the opportunity afforded to present the motion for the board's consideration," Guerra said. 

The college was named after Herbert Wertheim, a FIU board of trustees member and chairman of the Dr. Herbert and Nicole Wertheim Family Foundation.

According to Guerra's presentation, Wertheim has provided dynamic leadership to build FIU into a major research university.

Last year, Wertheim donated $20 million to the College of Medicine initiative, one of the largest contributions in the University's history. This amount was eligible for a matching state grant, which raised the total to $40 million.

"I'm usually never lost for words, but this is truly one of the highlights of my life, being able to take the resources that my wife and I and my family have earned and to redistribute them in a way that it will help other people to live a better life and to be able to help this university become all that it can be," Wertheim said with tears in his eyes.

The Florida Board of Governors approved the College earlier this year. A national search for the College's dean is currently underway. The first class is expected to be admitted in 2008.

Other significant proposals presented at the meeting were also passed.

Marcos Perez, vice president of external affairs, proposed the concept of a student support complex and an expanded stadium at UP to be developed in different phases.

"Currently, the stadium has 7500 permanent seats, and we spend quite a bit of money every year to bring in temporary bleachers in order to meet the minimum for stadium seatings," Perez said during his address to the BOT. "This would expand the stadium to about 20,000 permanent seats, including some luxury suites and club seats."

Perez said phase one would be completed by 2008.

Phase two would be the construction of a student support complex composed of a welcome center for services such as registration, advising, financial aid and admissions. This project is expected to be completed by 2009, according to Perez.

Although the proposal was passed, Alex Zyne, associate vice president of real estate development, spoke about the financial aspects of the proposal and said the University was creating an FIU athletic finance corporation to accommodate the financing structure. The finances were not expected to exceed $35 million.

"I feel terrific," Maidique told The Beacon after the meeting. "It was a great day for our University, a day in which we had the opportunity to recognize one of the most outstanding contributors and supporters  of the University during its history."

Headline: Review: The Ettes - Shake the Dust (Music CD)
Author: Samantha Quiñon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Blending Nancy Sinatra style with the fiery swagger of the Stooges, the Ettes are the latest band to hit garage punk. 

The trio formed just two years ago in L.A. and nabbed a record deal with Sympathy for the Record Industry through live shows and the support of local radio.

Shortly thereafter, their debut album, Shake the Dust, was recorded with renowned London garage rock producer Liam Watson.

With most songs averaging around two and a half minutes, there's no room to get bored. 

The 14 songs zip along, seamlessly moving from one track to the next, refraining from sounding like one giant song by varying the tempo and bringing in new instruments like the tambourine and synthesizer. Slower tracks, like "Ghost" and "I Wanna Go Home," are standouts with their Patsy Cline gusto.

The lyrics are equally classic, with darkness and staying power that conjures up the Shangri-Las and Joan Jett.

The first song, "Reputation," has a distinctly "Leader of the Pack" sound with a similar handclapping chorus, and the intense power chords and lyric timing on "Dead and Gone" bring Jett's early work to mind.

Overall, Shake The Dust has that punky-but-polished vibe that suggests The Ettes went from next door to recording studio without a bit of fuss.

Headline: Review: Loco Roco (Video Game)
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The PSP has been seeing an emergence in quirky titles as of late, such as Mr. Exit and Me and My Katamari, the portable spin-off to the PS2 hit. Loco Roco is the latest title in this trend to offer simple and enjoyable gameplay with an original, colorful atmosphere.

The premise of Loco Roco is simple enough, yet unusual.  You guide creatures known as Locos through various environments, saving as many as you can.

You collect fruits and berries for points while avoiding obstacles like the Moja. Within gameplay, you solve various puzzles to reach the goal as fast as possible.  

How you control the Locos sets the game apart from others.  You use the L and R shoulder buttons to actually tilt the environment in the direction you wish the Locos to go, while jumping is done with both shoulder buttons.

  As you progress in a stage, you find more Locos to save, which when combined, form a giant Loco. Using the circle button will cause all the Locos to separate in order to fit into smaller areas, while the same button will cause all the Locos nearby to gather and form.  

Controls are responsive and simple to learn, making the game accessible to anyone, yet providing a challenge to discover all that the game can offer. 

Along the way, there are other creatures to aid the Locos reach new areas, and with multiple hidden paths in stages and plenty of minigames, there is always something to do.     

There's tons of fun and replay value to be had with this title. Along with 40 levels, the game includes a stage editor allowing players to create their own stages and share them with other PSP owners via AdHoc. Since game sharing does not require other PSP owners to own a copy of the game, potential buyers can try out the game before they buy it.

Aesthetically, the game has a simple, vibrant look. It moves smoothly with no rough edges, giving it an organic feel as you tilt the very landscape, which makes exploring the world of Loco Roco an enjoyable experience. The soundtrack complements the atmosphere even further with a unique vibe that is as cheerful and childlike as the Locos who provide vocals throughout the score in their own language.

It's great to see more original titles like this one finding a place in the current market.

With the advent of the next-generation systems, some can easily overlook portable systems, where we have seen many new, unique and innovative titles.  Loco Roco continues this push toward using simplicity to create an experience that is enjoyable for anyone.

Headline: Review: Scissor Sisters - Ta-Dah! (Music CD)
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
The Scissor Sisters return to profitable prominence with the glittery pop of their sophomore album, Ta-Dah! 

This five-piece group named after a lesbian sex position can be trusted to make infectious pop music, if not tortillas. In the UK, where the group has been more warmly received than the US, their home country, the group launched a free concert in Trafalgar Square to promote the album - people danced and cavorted happily in the public fountains without a care in the world, which is quite ironic, considering the first single on the album is titled "I Don't Feel Like Dancing."

The cheerful first single has one of the happiest - and I refuse to say "gayest," for all that it implies - melodies the Scissor Sisters have recorded. That's no surprise once you consider the fact that Sir Elton John plays piano on it. Rather than be taken aback by their own camp, the Scissor Sisters have opted to embrace it as a vehicle for thoughtful and resonating music.

Jake Shears, front man for Scissor Sisters, displays again his talent for song craft with stylish diversity. The first song off the album gallops merrily despite forlorn lyrics like "My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way / You think that I could muster up a little soft, shoop devil sway  / But I don't feel like dancin' no sir, no dancin' today."  

The juxtaposition of Shears' bitter lyrics with Elton's sweet music gives the song a distinctive aftertaste - the kind you find yourself humming long after it's been turned down.  In the song "I Can't Decide," a deceptively cheerful ragtime melody belies the resentful tone as Shears sings, "It's a b***h convincing people to like you / if I stop now, call me a quitter / but if lies were cats, you'd be a litter." 

The song is about the indecision to kill someone who has wronged you - brilliant!  Haven't we all been there before?  Yes - and because we relate, we dance.

Ana Matronic, Jake Shears' female counterpart on stage, is sidelined in this album, but the reverberating, stomping and possessing dance track "Kiss You Off" brings our lovely gamine to the front. Matronic delivers the song in the spirit of Blondie, and the Pink Floyd-inspired guitar riffs give the electro song its nails - its blood red acrylic nails.  Lyrics like "Watch me start a fire in your shade" are a prime example of the lyrical flair that can be found on this album.

It's hard to classify the Scissor Sisters, and that is a big part of their charm.  Thus, labeling them as "gay music" (even though Shears is an out musician) is both unfair and inaccurate. Good music should be fun and exciting - and what's more fun than a surprise?

The Scissor Sisters know this, the songs reflect that philosophy, and they have produced an album that won't fail to surprise or amuse. The music is fresh and exciting because it's contrary to what people will expect - that's a great theme for a band that has been wrongly judged before.  

If that somehow makes them "gay," then I guess we all better throw on a feather boa and some body glitter - this album will get you to dance, even if you don't feel like it.  Surprise, surprise: great music doesn't need a name or label.

Headline: Beach a 'diamond in the rough'
Author: Melissa Nelson / AP Wire
&nbsp;
It's where barefoot hippies meet Burberry-clad yuppies, biker babes hang with beach bums and haute cuisine is served with a side of bluegrass.

For years, this one-time general store and current Picolo's Restaurant and Red Bar have anchored the Florida Panhandle artists' enclave and celebrity hideaway of Grayton Beach.

The Red Bar is best known for its crab cakes - a recipe perfected by Belgian-born chef and co-owner Oliver Petit - its funky decor and its live music.

"People have been attracted to this area for years - artists, musicians, cooks. It was the place in the Panhandle where a band could come and do something besides covers. And this building was the center of that, it is one of the oldest buildings in the county," said Kyle Ogle, guitarist for the popular bluegrass band Dread Clampitt, a favorite at The Red Bar.

Petit, who has co-owned the establishment with brother Phillipe for 11 years, said the decor is modeled from a night club their father once owned in Liege, Belgium. He calls the look his "tribute to pop culture."

The ceiling of the Red Bar's small main dining room is covered in foreign film posters and red Christmas lights adorn its walls. A silver disco ball and crystal chandeliers add light along with an illuminated plastic Santa Claus. A collection of random street signs, black and white photos, statuettes and an antique cash register add to the eclectic look. Mismatched tables and chairs are tightly packed on the worn wood floors.

Sheryl Crow and former fiance Lance Armstrong are "friends of the restaurant," as well as NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, Petit said. Willie Nelson has hung out at The Red Bar and pop star Steve Winwood told a record producer friend about Dread Clampitt after hearing them perform there.

Winwood's friend helped the group produce a CD. Music legend Sam Bush, founder of the New Grass Revival, spent an evening oyster shucking with the band after hearing them at the bar.

Marsha Holton, an organizer of the annual Magnolia Music Festival, an acoustic event at the Spirit of Suwannee Music Park near Live Oak in northeast Florida, listened to Dread Clampitt perform live at the Red Bar and said she was hooked on the venue and the band.

Holton said Dread Clampitt's take on traditional bluegrass stylings and the band's original songs have been a huge hit at her festival, which marks its 10th anniversary Oct. 19-22.

"I think seeing them play at the Red Bar is like seeing them play in your living room because it is so relaxed," she said. "I love their songs, their music, it's happy music, it makes everyone want to get up and dance."

Band members Ogle and Balder W.P. Saunders grew up in the area. Their songs often pay tribute to their Panhandle roots with lyrics about the ban on commercial net fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, Mississippi tourists and the beauty of the white sands and turquoise waters of this region.

"Grayton Beach is like a diamond in the rough," Saunders said.

Headline: Under the Radar: The Women's Center
Subheadline: Helping women recognize their potential
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
If you've walked through the Campus Life hallway on the Graham Center's second floor and been distracted by the large number of flyers posted on the bulletin boards, then you might have missed the Women's Center. 

Financially supported by the Student Government Association, the Women's Center is intended to create awareness of issues affecting women while developing women's potential.

The center does this by offering several services and programs.

According to Suzanne Onorato, associate director of the Women's Center, the Mentoring Partnerships Program and the Wild Succulent Women forum are among the center's notable programs.

The mentoring program, done in partnership with the Office of Alumni Relations, encourages students' growth in certain aspects of their lives by pairing them up with a FIU staff member or alumnus.

"The mentoring program … builds a community of mentoring throughout the campus and assists students in their personal and professional development," Onorato said. 

The other program, the Wild Succulent Women forum, is a more controversial program that the center hosts.

At this forum, the discussions address heated topics such as women's sexuality and body image. Created and facilitated by the Women's Center Graduate Assistant Tara Warshaw, this monthly forum brings together both men and women late at night in the residence halls for elaborate dialogue.

"I would say that the audience for the forum is about 50 percent women and 40 percent male," Warshaw said. "We do different talks and activities such as 'Erotic Robots,' where we explore the decisions that determine what's right for you sexually and whether sexuality is like an on-off switch." 

Although Onorato did not discuss specific budget information about the center with The Beacon, she did state that SGA has provided the center with extra funding this year for particular events. 

"This year, [SGA] provided us with additional funds to facilitate the 'Sisterhood Retreat' Oct. 13 through the 15," she said.

The Sisterhood Retreat, a new addition to the Women's Center schedule this year, will be taking place in Alva, Florida, where participants will spend a weekend off-campus to further engage women's issues.

"We're going to have discussions and several workshops that deal with identity and other topics," Warshaw said. "It's free, but there is a $15 deposit that is given back the minute they step onto the bus."

While new events such as the retreat are being introduced by the Women's Center this year, traditional events such as Take Back the Night, which is a march that deals with sexual assault and campus violence, will be taking place again.

Scheduled during April for Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the annual event is co-chaired by the Women's Center and the Victim Advocacy Center and involves collaboration with different departments across campus. 

According to Onorato, last year's Take Back the Night was planned by about 15 individuals from different FIU branches, including the Student Organizations Council and the Residence Hall Association.

"This group planned an exceptional march and rally designed to promote awareness of sexual assault and domestic violence on campus," said Onorato. "I was really impressed by the collaboration and cooperation that occurred during Take Back the Night for the last two years."

Even though the Women's Center caters to females, males aren't excluded. Aside from attending the WSW forum, they can participate in events such as Take Back the Night.

When asked about having similar programs available for men at the university, Onorato referred to women's rights and the center's objective of using its programs to make people aware of the importance of those rights.

"Although women are the majority in our colleges and universities, they are still paid less than men, make less in their lifetime and are not represented equally in decision making positions within our society," she said. "It is through programs like the Women's Center that we are able to promote awareness and question where we are today."

The Women's Center is located in GC 2200 and is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Headline: Body Language
Subheadline: Exhibit showcases human preservation, advancement
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
FIU alumna Melissa Jimenez saw "Bodies…The Exhibition" in Tampa eight months ago as a favor to senior Robin Butkovitz. 

Jimenez's idea of a vacation did not include cavorting near a collection of cadavers.

"At the beginning, it was kind of weird seeing all of these dead bodies," she said. "I had no interest in seeing dead people."

"Bodies…The Exhibition" made its debut in Miami Sept. 22. It features 20 whole body specimens and more than 250 partial body specimens, all of which are real.

The exhibition is comprised of nine themed galleries that deal with the skeletal, muscular, nervous, circulatory, digestive, respiratory, reproductive and urinary systems of the body. 

Jimenez did, however, decide that the exhibition was performing an environmentally humanitarian act.

"We're not wasting people, and that's always a good thing. Recycling is a good thing," she said.

Butkovitz, who is an exercise physiology major, deals with the subject of the human body often, so she was enthralled by what she considered to be a once in a lifetime opportunity.

"It was a great exhibit. I saw things I've wanted to see all of my life," Butkovitz said.

What fascinated Butkovitz the most about the exhibit was that the exposed bodies were stripped of their skin, revealing only muscle, tissue, and organs - the very essence of what makes up a human being.

"There was no race, no ethnicity. You just see humans as humans and you realize we're all the same on the inside," she said.

This controversial cadaver exhibit found a home at The Shops at Sunset Place, located at 5701 Sunset Drive, after being banned from various venues.

Both the Ft. Lauderdale City Commission and the Museum of Discovery and Science rejected the exhibit due to concerns over the origins of the donated bodies, according to a recent article published in The Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.

According to the press release, all of the bodies can be traced to the Dalian Medical University Plastination Laboratories in China. Each body was either donated or unidentified.

All specimens died of natural causes. 

Yet, there were some cases where the medical director was able to identify and label the apparent medical problem of certain cadavers in the exhibit.

For example, one display showed a healthy pair of lungs and a pair of cancerous lungs. Therefore, it can be assumed that the specimen with cancerous lungs died of complications from the disease. However, it is important to note that it is illegal to disclose any information concerning the identity of the specimen and/or its cause of death.

Daniel Kellett, general manager for the exhibition, says the reason the bodies are actively posed is for educational purposes.

"It's cutting-edge technology for education because normally, you have to be a medical student to see a dissected human body," he said. "They're detailed enough to explain what the general public might not necessarily know."

Probably the most controversial gallery - and an optional part of the exhibit - was the fetal development gallery. A disclaimer was placed in the entryway, telling visitors they did not have to view this part of the exhibit. 

This gallery had samples of fetuses ranging from nine weeks of development to 28 weeks, as well as samples of fetuses with birth defects like cleft lip and spina bifida. 

Against one wall were samples of various types of placentas and a sample of an ectopic pregnancy.

Kellett refused to give an opinion as to whether or not the exhibit has any ethical conflicts or not.

"I think that judgment needs to be made per person. I would like to invite anyone to see the show before making a judgment," he said.

After leaving the exhibit in Tampa, Jimenez decided it was a "good learning experience." 

"It's real, it's in your face, it's real bodies," she said.

Butkovitz decided after seeing the exhibit that it was "scientific art."

"When you think of science, you think of a process, but the exhibit itself is art because art is usually an expression of the artist," she said. "I don't think that anyone who views the exhibit can walk out of it without some emotion about what they just saw, and to me that's art."

"Bodies…The Exhibition" will run until March 25, 2007. The price of admission for adults is $22.50. An audio tour costs $27.50. For more information about the exhibit, call 1-866-866-8265 or visit www.bodiestheexhibition.com.
