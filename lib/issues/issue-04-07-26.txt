Dear Editor,
I think the newspaper is awesome and is an excellent way for students to voice their opinions about the University.  I am interested in seeing an article placed in the FIU Beacon about the ongoing debate concerning reparations for African-Americans and what it means for the black students that attend FIU.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

   I'm not sure who is to blame, but the new system for looking up courses for the coming semester that has been implemented using "Peoplesoft" is just lousy. Why did we give up a relatively good system (though I've seen better, for example, at U.S.F. in Tampa) that had all the features necessary to find courses easily for a system that is clumsy, difficult to use, and certainly not user friendly? I haven't programmed seriously in about six or seven years and I could have written better software myself in only a couple weeks. What is going on??

Standing at the doors of GPA Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m., watching a tropical downpour as I waited for my last class of the day to make the trek from main campus to the 'outback' of campus, about a dozen students huddled in the doorway, waiting out the rain before making a mad dash to their cars or back to campus.
Out of the corner of my eye, I watched a lone, wet figure in a white t-shirt and jeans, navigating his way through the downpour and puddles, sloshing through the parking lots and path from main campus to GPA.
"Look at that guy," several students commented. "He must be crazy to walk in the rain like that, no umbrella, no raincoat."
Crazy like a fox, I thought, as I recognized the figure as one of my 2 p.m. students.
He was drenched, walking all the way to the arena from DM in a downpour, but by God, he made it to GPA on time for class.
He was, indeed, the ONLY student in the class to make it by 2 p.m.
Soaked to the bone, all he could do is laugh a little at his predicament, as he walked down the hallway into the classroom and tried to wring out his clothes.
He was, indeed, shocked to see the classroom empty, expect for me, but he knew I'd be there because I had a 12:30 class in the same room.
After a quick trip to the restroom for towels and to pass his shirt under the hand dryer for a moment, he returned to the classroom.
And still, he was the lone student.
Jokingly, he encouraged me to move along with the day's lesson, saying "I came to learn! I'll stay."
Over the next 15 minutes, a few other folks wandered in, all shocked to find me and The Wet Guy, discussing the assigned reading for the day, as planned.
"We have to stay?" they asked timidly.
"You bet!" was our response.
Again and again, The Wet Guy told them, "I'm staying. I came to learn!"
I can only dream on a classroom, somewhere, in a galaxy far, far away, where indeed every student would be dedicated enough to wring himself out, open his book, take out pen and notebook and say, "I came to learn..."

Headline: Football team hoping to reach 15,000 requirement
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The young Golden Panther football program, entering its third season of intercollegiate play, is growing up. The evolution from cub to alpha male begins as the team starts its 2-year transition into Division I-A football this coming fall.

In order to achieve the goal of becoming a full-fledged I-A program in the Sunbelt Conference by 2006, FIU will have to comply with certain requirements of the NCAA. The guidelines require that all Division I-A schools offer a minimum of 200 athletic scholarships (85 are for football), field 16 collegiate sports, include at least 5 I-A teams in the regular season schedule and average 15,000 in home game attendance. 

The first three requirements are within the school's power and budget, however, the 15,000 average attendance is not entirely under the program's control. 

The inaugural season drew an average of 7,765 to the stands of FIU Stadium, with the largest crowd of 17,314 coming for the home opener against St. Peter's. The home crowd failed to break 10,000 for the rest of the year and attendance dropped as the season progressed. In 2003, the stadium was equipped to sit 12,763 while plans for a seating capacity of 30,000 are still in the works.  

"[The school] will work hard to put people in the stands, establish an attractive schedule and make every home game an event. Plans to stimulate average attendance include moving home starting times to later in the day as well as more giveaways during the games,"   said Athletic Director Rick Mello  in a statement through the FIU Athletics. The return of the Orange Blossom Classic, which will feature FIU against FAMU should also help attendance. 

"This gives us the best chance. Though we are a growing program, this event will guarantee us the needed 15,000 requirement," said Mello.

     Ultimately, the determinant in attendance for FIU home games will not be the number of seats at the stadium, nor the amount of promos and giveaways, but the very same concept that has always spoken loudest in sports, wins. FIU finished the 2003 campaign with a 2-10 record and will face tougher opponents in the coming fall. If the Golden Panthers want a successful transition into where the big cats play, the team must be competitive off, but especially on the field.

Headline: Transfer eager to play for Coach Stevens
Author: Vilmarie Estrella / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
At the tender age of 7, she'd watch the older high school girls do it.  At 9, she gave it a try herself for the first time.  And now, at the age of 20, she's got many years of experience under her belt and is no longer much of a rookie.

At playing volleyball, that is.

Junior Carolina Cano, the newest addition to the Golden Panthers' women's volleyball team, is out to prove herself to her team, FIU sports aficionados and her coach and long-time friend, Cookie Stevens. For Cano, a recreational therapy major, it's a privilege to play on Stevens' team.

"I love the way she coaches.  She's strict and demanding and I've always wanted to be coached by her," said Cano.

The two first met when Cano played for the South Florida Volleyball Club, where Stevens was the head coach and Cano was a setter.  The way Stevens ran the practices was very well done and challenging, said Cano. And now that a handful of the girls on FIU's team have graduated, spots have opened up and Cano received a full scholarship to play with the golden panthers.

Despite Cano's rookie status, Stevens knows what to expect from the junior transfer.

"I have known her since she was a sophomore where I coached and trained her for a club team. I know what kind of work ethic and commiment she has," said Coach Stevens.

Joining the Golden Panthers signified a change of role for Cano. Due to the overpowering height of most Division I players, at 5 feet 4 inches, Cano will have to switch positions. She will no longer play setter, a position she has played all her life. Cano will recede to the back to play liberal defense.

"The change in position won't change my love for the game," said Cano of the switch.  "I don't think it will be hard to adjust to the new position. I just need to get my mind set on it. I've always liked playing defense."

Stevens expects a smooth transition from Cano in switching to a defensive mind set.

"She has a setter's mentality, which will help her in knowing who the setter will set," said Stevens who will also consider Cano as a backup setter. 

"She played defense at Miami Dade so it shouldn't be a tough transition."

The setter is coming from a slew of different teams.  She first started playing in Colombia at school when she was 9, and then joined Bogota's Junior League.  When she came to Florida at 14, she played for Miami Coral Park during her four years of high school.  By her sophomore year, she was playing on the varsity team. 

Upon graduation, she was offered a scholarship at Lake Sumter Community College, where she made the all-freshman team for the National Junior College Athletic Association.

As a sophomore, she transferred to Miami-Dade Community College on a full scholarship, where one of her most glorious moments playing the game was created.  As part of the Lady Sharks, Cano stated a state championship and went on to win third place at nationals with the Sharks.

"We had an awesome team; all the girls were very talented and had a lot of experience.  Almost all of us were Colombian, which created a better chemistry," said Cano.

When Cano graduated from Coral Park there were no scholarships available for Stevens to offer her. 

"We had no spot for her so she opted for Lake Sumter and later transfered to Miami Dade. She is a great kid and she did a good job at both schools," said Stevens who is glad she was able to have a spot for Cano on this years team.

	With volleyball playing such a huge part in the story of her life, this young athlete has never thought about quitting the game she so loves.

"Not everyone is born with a gift. Once you find out what that gift is, why let it go?  My passion for the game will never let me quit; it goes beyond your abilities or aptitude," she said.

	This gift Cano speaks of led her to be chosen to become a part of The Miami Herald's prestigious All-Dade team two years in a row in 2001 and 2002 and be chosen as the MVP for Coral Park's volleyball team in 2001.

But not all comes naturally.  Besides attending arduous practices, Cano runs on her own for 45 minutes non-stop nearly every day, does aerobics and plays beach volleyball to get in tip-top shape for the season.

To her new team, Cano offers four things:  leadership, friendship, ethics and discipline, which she hopes will welcome her into the FIU community. 

Cano will make her season debut on Sept. 1 when the Golden Panthers take on cross-town rival Miami Hurricanes at the Golden Panther Arena.

Headline: CBS anchor analyzes athletics, FIU football
Subheadline: Jim Berry: ' The age of the dumb jock is over'
Author: Giovani Benitez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
He says it all began with his love for sports, but while Jim Berry is no professional athlete, he's clearly an athletic superstar ... on television.  

Berry is sports director at WFOR-CBS4, a position he's held for eight years.  In that time, he's been able to interview big names in sports and even host his own local sports show every Sunday night.  

His late-night weekly show, "Jim Berry's Sports Wrap," often beats its competitors in the same time slot, according to ratings reports by Nielsen Media Research.  

In a one-on-one interview with Berry last week, The Beacon asked wide-ranging questions from FIU football to steroid use among college athletes.  Berry was quick to respond to every question and made an effort to talk about his beliefs on the relationship between education and sports.

 Q:  The FIU football team has been around for three years and was just upgraded to Division 1-A.  Does it surprise you that it's only been three years and they were able to get to that division?

A:  I'm led to believe that was the plan all along.  You never know how quickly things are going to happen, and in a market where, frankly, we're saturated by college football and dominated by the University of Miami, it is a bit of a surprise that FIU Football has caught on.  I'm glad to see it.  It certainly was a bold step by the university to go for it.  

The same can be said for FAU up in Boca Raton, led by Howard Schnellenberger.  At FIU, Don Strock has done a great job.  I guess it just goes to show you that there is so much football talent here that there is enough left over after the big three (Miami, Florida and Florida State) get their pick of the litter, to still fill quality programs at other schools.

Q:  Being new to this division, as a team, what do you think they need to focus on the most?

A:  From a football point of view, obviously, they just need to focus on developing quality players.  That's probably going to be the challenge.  I would expect that their starting unit is probably pretty competitive, but I would think that depth would be a big issue.  

So, for a program like FIU, I think the big issue is getting more good football players so that you can build a good football program. 

 Then, the second part of that, obviously, is how you market it, how you sell it, how you get the community excited about FIU football.  That's not easy because FIU is not a traditional kind of school where you have alumni that's devoted to coming back to it.  That, I would think, would be a real big challenge to get the people that went to FIU interested in what the team is doing.

Q: With all your years as a sports journalist, you've seen all these different athletes as they've gone through time, gone to other teams, and you've also seen the young ones, like Dwayne Wade.  What would you say to a college student or even a teenager that says, "I want to be the next Shaquille O'Neal. I want to be the next superstar athlete?"

A: A couple of things.  Number one: the age of the dumb jock is over.  The guys, now, that are doing well are smart.  So, don't think that just because you've got athletic ability, that that's enough, because it's not.  

Sports' training now is so sophisticated that there are a lot of guys that are as athletically gifted as you, so you better focus on your mind also because the people you're going against are smart.  They're not just physically talented, but they're also intellectually gifted.  

The second thing I would say is that most of the great athletes that I've covered have what I call the three D's: dedication, discipline and determination.  They're dedicated to what it is they do and dedicated to being the best at it.  They're disciplined enough to do those things every day which bore most people, but they will do it.  Michael Jordan was the ultimate gym rat.  Dwayne Wade is the same way.  Alonzo Mourning is the same way.  

I've seen it time and again that the great ones have the discipline to go in the gym, or go on the field, do what it is and work hours and hours by themselves with nobody demanding that they do it other than their own inner voice saying, "I've got to do this to get better."  They have that sense of inner discipline, which forces them to work on blossoming and developing their own skills.  

Then, the third thing they have is the determination part, where they refuse to be beaten and they refuse to be defeated.  Their sense of will becomes so great that, eventually, the people they're competing against feel that and eventually succumb to it.  It's not just pure talent.  It's that combined with work ethic, combined with an intellectual approach, combined with whatever it is they do that separates them.  It's not an accident.  It never is when the great ones seem to be better than the competition.  It's planned.  That would be my message to any young athlete.  If you really want to be great and dedicate yourself to the effort of being great, then there's a chance it's going to happen.  

Q:  Do you see that same determination in any college player now?

A:  I have seen it in a lot of college players at the University of Miami, certainly.  One guy that jumps at me right now is Willis McGahee, who was a guy who, you remember before his breakout season, was third string.  Everybody thought, "Well, this guy will never get a chance to play."  There were all these people ahead of him, and then Clint Portis leaves early and Frank Gore gets hurt and so they turn to McGahee.  

McGahee, though, always felt that he was the best back there.  He always felt that if he had the opportunity that it would come out, so he didn't give up on his work habits.  He had the same routine. 

His lifting, his running, his speed drills, his acceleration drills, all that stuff.  So, when his time came, he was ready.  What was funny was that everybody was surprised ... except Willis.  And time and again, he'd do interviews, and people would ask, "Are you surprised?" and he would say "No."  And people would think he was cocky, but he wasn't because he knew what he had put into it and he knew the ability that he felt he had, he was just now finally getting the opportunity to show it.  

Q:  The use of steroids...now it's becoming a big issue on college campuses for college athletes and, obviously, in some professional athletes.  What are your thoughts on steroid use in college?

A:  Well, steroid use at any level is terrible.  You're ruining your body, probably going to kill yourself and die a painful and ugly and early death.  Unfortunately, the money is so huge now in professional sports that people look for any advantage they can get to get to that level.  

In the minds of some, the end justifies the means.  If you can become a professional athlete and make millions of dollars, many will feel that it's worth the physical risk to take steroids so that you can break through and become on that elite level. 

Obviously, I hate to see it happen.  In baseball, I think personally it has ruined the game and cheapened the game because the records don't mean anything.  

I know guys are bigger and stronger now, and they weight train, but I mean come on, I've seen way too many guys hit the ball with one hand with the other hand flying off and the ball is traveling 400-plus feet.  To me, that's just unnatural.  I remember during the Mark McGwire era, when he was launching all those home runs, I said, "This just doesn't feel right to me." 

 I was one that was not excited about it because I felt there was something artificial about the whole thing.  I remember Reggie Jackson swinging so hard that he would fall out of the batter's box trying to hit a home run.  

Reggie Jackson was a strong dude and now, all of a sudden, you've got guys who are swinging with one hand and the ball's flying to the upper, upper deck.  To me, it damns the sport, but I understand the pressure involved.  

In football, the pain and the pressure to be bigger and stronger than the next guy is driving guys to do it.  Until the sports want to clean it up and police themselves, it's not going to change, because the money is too big now and guys are going to do what they have to do get there and do what they feel they have to do to stay there.

Shortly after the interview ended, Berry made a run to the news set for his ten o'clock sportscast on WFOR-CBS4's sister station, WBFS-UPN33.  

While his work may be time consuming, he says he will continue to give his audience what they want, in an effort to "keep it real" and have fun while reporting on the games and athletes he loves to watch.

Headline: Block tuition undermines education opportunities
Author: Sue Arrowsmith / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The box of Cheerios I was carefully balancing on my lap tipped over as I braked to avoid rear-ending a white van that cut in front of me on I-95.  

I had to close my eyes and take a deep breath to steady myself. The bits of cereal scattered under my feet was lunch.  I had no idea when I chose journalism as my major that the school was located at the Biscayne Bay Campus, considerably far from my home in Kendall.  

Sitting long hours in dense traffic, adjusting work schedules to make it to class on time, skipping lunch or dinner, those are things I've become accustomed to.  

After all, I'm just one of the many trying to juggle life and a college education, all the while keeping in mind how narrow the job market has become.  

Still, I always believed the hard work would eventually pay off. Then, very recently, something happened that stifled my determination.  

I read an article in the Miami Herald about drastic changes proposed for Florida universities' tuition. In light of an audit performed by the state's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, it was determined that too much money - $62 million to be exact - was going toward the education of students who don't graduate in the expected four years. 

 The auditors concluded too many students were retaking failed classes and experimenting with different majors, suggesting the majority of students are leisurely taking their time to graduate. FIU was mentioned as one of the highest to have "excessive" spending.  

The audit, however, did not take into consideration students' socio-economic status or the growing complaint from students about classes becoming full too quickly.

You might wonder what the state legislature's reaction to the audit results was. More government financial assistance so that students can concentrate solely on school?  

Perhaps increase the faculty size and open more classes? Not even close. A spokesman for Governor Jeb Bush confirmed he approves "block tuition" as a so-called solution.  

If admitted, it means public universities will charge all students full time tuition - 15 credits per semester - regardless of how many classes they take, thus forcing them to load up on more classes and graduate sooner.  

The proposal, of course, is intended to "encourage" students to complete their education faster. 

Is it just me or is there a contradiction in the lawmakers' reasoning? They want students to graduate in four years, but they also don't want them to take extra classes even though the necessary ones are full.  

That Florida legislators are concerned with tax money being wasted is understandable, even appreciated, and most people would agree something needs to be done.  

But at what costs?  

Critics say the suggested change would be detrimental to the goals of higher learning.  Universities are supposed to offer a broad-based educational experience, which includes classes in humanities and sciences, not just math and English courses. They say legislators want to make a business out of education and don't truly have the students' best interests at heart.  

There would be no early graduation benefit for students who are currently taking less than 12 credits because they need to work. "Block tuition" would also penalize those students who have been attending full-time. 

For many, 12 credits is already a heavy load, more credits might lower the success rate.        

An important truth, one not mentioned by the auditors, is that the average college student is not 18 and living at home.  

We aren't talking about Ivy League schools nestled on piles of "donations" from wealthy parents, flanked by pristine, upper-class neighborhoods.  Public universities, like FIU, are composed of working-class individuals.  

Sen. Ken Pruitt, a chairman for the Senate Appropriations Committee, commented, "We don't have the luxury of having a student stay there for six years."  

I agree. Most students at FIU don't have the "luxury" of going to school for six or more years, it's a sacrifice, and many times a struggle as they work to sustain themselves and their families simultaneously.  

As I exited the interstate, I wondered if I would make it to graduation.  

It seems every semester, more hurdles accumulate along the path to success. On my way, I sped past high-school kids walking home from North Miami Senior High.  

Would "block tuition" increase the number of high-school drop-outs if the idea of a college education became frighteningly unreachable?  

How would it affect the unemployment rate? The future suddenly seemed like the summer sky above, bleak and uncertain.

Headline: 9/11 Comission publishes scathing report
Author: Chris Mondics / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
In a stinging indictment of the Bush and Clinton administrations, the independent Sept. 11 commission released a final report Thursday saying the government overlooked multiple signs of an impending terrorist attack over eight years. The panel called for an overhaul of American intelligence gathering, including a single leader over the nation's fragmented intelligence community.

Among the many failings of national policy makers, the commission suggested that Washington's obsession with the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998 may have distracted senior government officials from the terrorism threat at a time when al-Qaida was becoming a gathering force.

The commission, known formally as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also recommended in its unanimous report that the United States repair relations with Muslims around the world, saying that growing hostility among Muslims toward American power and influence had fueled terrorism.

The report was unstinting in its criticism not only of the Bush and Clinton administrations but also of Congress, which it said had failed to properly oversee American intelligence gathering.

"Our failure took place over many years and administrations," said former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, the Republican chairman of the commission. "There is no single individual who is responsible for this failure. Any person in a senior position within our government during this time bears some element of responsibility for the government's actions."

The commission recommended establishing a national intelligence director who would advise the president and would have budget and operational authority over the 15 agencies responsible for gathering intelligence. Commission members said the failure to share information among intelligence agencies hampered the government's response to the Sept. 11 attacks and may have foreclosed opportunities to halt the plot.

"The fact of the matter is we just did not get it in this country," said commission Vice Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democratic former congressman from Indiana. "If you look back at all of the signals, we just did not put it together. You did not have to have access to presidential daily briefs or other classified information to figure it out."

Washington reaction to the report, from the White House to Capitol Hill, generally was laudatory, although it was unclear whether its proposals would be adopted.

"We went into the 21st century, an era of transnational terrorism, with a national security apparatus designed to cope with the Cold War," said commission member John Lehman, former secretary of the Navy.

Bush administration officials said they'd consider the commission's ideas for restructuring intelligence gathering-as did congressional leaders-but made no commitments. 

Congressional leaders have said they doubt Congress would have time to work on the problem before the end of the year, largely because of the impending congressional and presidential elections.

"I don't think it's a matter of whether there will be intelligence reform," said National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. "I think there will be intelligence reform. I think it is a matter of how and precisely when and precisely what will be done."

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said he endorsed the commission's call for a national intelligence director.

"This report carries a very simple message for all of America about the security of all Americans," Kerry said, after receiving a briefing from Kean and Hamilton while riding in his motorcade from Dearborn, Mich., to Detroit. "We can do better. We must do better-and there is an urgency to our doing better."

The 10-member commission, divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats, was appointed amid partisan bickering in late 2002 and began working in January 2003. 

The White House feared initially that the commission would become a vehicle for political attacks during the presidential campaign, but Sept. 11 victims and family members pressured the administration to endorse the idea.

The commission's work occasionally became grist for the partisan haggling and guerrilla warfare that have come to characterize political life in Washington. But commission members mostly managed to remain above the fray, unanimously endorsing their investigation's factual findings and recommendations.

The 567-page report constitutes what's by far the most comprehensive account to date of the evolution of the terrorist movement from what was largely an overseas threat to an urgent domestic issue.

Beginning with the first World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, the commission detailed multiple al-Qaida operations. From the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000 to the "Black Hawk Down" attacks on U.S. forces by al-Qaida-trained tribesmen in Sudan in 1993 to the so-called millennium plot in January 2000, in which operatives planned attacks in Los Angeles and Jordan, the commission said terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden made known their intention to cause harm.

Yet the government's reaction was tepid, the panel said.

It said that as late as 1997, bin Laden was viewed primarily as a financier of terrorism, not the leader of a terrorist group who plotted operations and was able to deploy well-trained, well-financed operatives.

Intelligence officials began receiving a flood of information in the summer of 2001 suggesting an attack was imminent, but lacked specifics. Former CIA director George Tenet told the commission the intelligence system was "blinking red" then, but that most of the information was pointing toward an attack overseas.

Had intelligence agencies not been so compartmentalized, the panel said, more progress might have been made.

The commission faulted the FBI for failing to understand the significance of the arrest of al-Qaida member Zacarias Moussaoui on immigration violations after he'd sought instruction at a Minnesota flight school.

 It said diplomatic efforts by the Bush and Clinton administrations failed to dislodge bin Laden from his Afghanistan redoubt.

"Both Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush and their top advisers told us they got the picture--they understood bin Laden was a danger," the commission said. "But given the character and pace of their policy efforts, we do not believe they fully understood just how many people al-Qaida might kill."

Headline: Famished no longer: Biscayne Bay food court extends hours
Author: Marianly Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Who says speaking your mind won't change things?

The Beacon published in the July 12 issue a story ("Famished at FIU") that explained how, to the dismay of many students, the Biscayne Bay Campus offered no hot meals after 2:30 p.m.,  its Oasis stand serving only  coffee, smoothies and pre-packaged sandwiches until 4:30 p.m.  

"After reading the article, I made the decision to change the hours for summer session B," Paul Sparks, the BBC food services director, announced. "We listened to the students' voice in the paper."

As of July 19, the food court's Subway will open Mondays through Fridays from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Fridays until 2:30 p.m.  The Oasis will close at 2:30 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays.

From July 12 through July 16, the Oasis extended its hours until 6:30 p.m. with the food court closing at 2:30 p.m.  Sparks said the Oasis extension for that week served as a trial run to test the amount of possible clients received.

The hours will be reviewed weekly according to the traffic and profits, and adjustments will be made on an as-needed basis.  

"I would like to see the Oasis stay open until 6:30 p.m. and the food court can close at the same time because we can still get the pre-packaged Subway sandwiches in the Oasis [where] they have more variety," said Gaby Gonzalez, a major in communications.

Sparks said there is an open door policy for suggestions and encourages students to leave comments through the BBC website.

Headline: Changes in high places
Subheadline: FIU seeks to increase efficiency through several administrative and academic reorganizations
Author: Erika Taveras / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU is currently undergoing structural changes in its administration in addition to an academic reorganization, according to Mark Rosenberg, provost and vice president of Academic Affairs.

In a memorandum, the provost assured the FIU community that these alterations will result in overall benefits to the school.  "[These changes will] improve our ability to achieve our vision as a top urban public research university," he said.

However, the main concern surrounding all current and planned university changes is the decline of state economic support.  According to the administration, both academic and structural reconstructions will be dealt with regardless of any lack of support that might be encountered. As mentioned by Rosenberg, "We will have to do more with less and we should expect to be more accountable for our efforts."

As the August state elections draw near, it is also likely that there will be many prominent modifications within the upcoming elected state government and state legislatures. Since it is not possible to predict who will sit in next year's state house and senate, it is still not known how these legislatures will vote regarding the economic predicaments soon to be faced by the state university system.

Despite these challenges, most of the planned changes will be implemented as planned. Several have already taken place, such as the merging of the College of Urban and Public Affairs with the College of Health and the creation of the Chapman Graduate School of Business.  In addition, the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management has been joined to the College of Business Administration.

Any further options for possible reconstruction within the different university schools will be submitted by the Deans of each college to provost Rosenberg by Dec. 1, 2004. 

Along with the academic emic mergings, FIU President Modesto A. Maidique announced several changes soon to be occurring within the administrative board itself.  

Paul D. Gallagher, who has served as vice president for Business and Finance, has now been given a position as senior vice president and chief of staff for the president.  Many of his duties will include dealing with governmental relation matters, athletics and real estate development.  In addition, Gallagher will oversee the University Technology Services and the Office of the Inspector General.  

Another position, that of university treasurer, was given to Alexander Zyne, an FIU alumnus who has also served as a vice president for the Business and Finance department.  As the university's treasurer, he will be responsible for the managing and investing of assets, along with the overseeing of any investments within the FIU foundation.  

The new vice president for the administration was announced to be Marcos Perez, also an FIU alumnus. Areas included under his new administrative role will be those of Facilities Management and Planning, Physical Plants Operations, Business Services, Public Safety and, Environmental Health and Safety.  In the past, Perez has served as chief of staff for the university president and as a member of the executive council.

Despite the mass restructuring these shifts will bring to the school's administrative and academic systems, Rosenberg states that they will eventually bring cohesion to the FIU community.

 "I believe we can successfully address these challenges if we work smarter by focusing our energies on promoting greater collaboration and efficiency across the entire spectrum of our curricula and our research," said Rosenberg.

Headline: Chuck Close artwork highlights MAM
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Staring down at you from the tall walls of the Miami Art Museum are the behemoth-sized prints of abstract printmaking artist Chuck Close. 

Only until you stand numb, face to face with Close's image - a big, bald head with two ominous eyes staring out behind spectacles and thick, dark facial hair - do you finally understand why the assortment of dots, shapes and colors that often describe his art have challenged the way we view printmaking. Close has practically reinvented it as an art.

All around the room are strange images, all in different shapes and sizes. From afar, your eyes will automatically visualize the image as a whole. Tiny multi-colored dots, small peculiar shapes and even numbers begin to take shape as you approach the images for a closer inspection.

Close has risen above several series of difficulties in his life. In 1988, at the age of 49, he suffered a spinal blood clot that left him a partial quadriplegic, forcing him to develop new techniques and styles to continue creating art. 

This, in turn, gave him the power to reach new heights of prominence in the worldwide artist community.

The Close exhibit may appear repetitive or limited, especially when some of his pieces take up entire walls and consist of several different exposures of the same photo. However, the intricate nature of his work makes up for this. If you take the time to get to know the abstract and sometimes awkward imagery, Close's work will reveal its treasures.

Running until Aug. 22, the exhibit features 118 works created between 1972-2002. 

Close displays his wide printmaking range with innovative techniques such as etching, lithography, handmade paper, direct gravure, silkscreen and even traditional Japanese woodcut.

Admission to the Miami Art Museum is $5 for adults, $2.50 for seniors and free for students with a valid ID. For more information, visit www.miamiartmuseum.org.

Headline: Possible food pyramid change favors whole grains
Author: Jennifer Mann / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - White bread, a mainstay of the American diet since at least the 1930s, is under attack.

The Department of Agriculture is considering a recommendation that consumers drastically cut consumption of fortified grains, which are used to enrich a wide variety of food products - particularly white bread.

Food industry experts say such a move, which would alter the recommended dietary food pyramid, could send a seismic shock through eating patterns, the economics of the food chain and businesses here in America's bread basket.

The refined grains sector already has been battered by the wildfire popularity of low-carbohydrate diets. More recently, white bread came under additional fire from a study released by Tufts University in Boston that links the consumption of such bread to wider waistlines.

"First it was the diet crazies, then within the nutritionist community you have the whole-grain zealots and now you have the dietary guidelines committee," said Josh Sosland of Sosland Publishing and BakingBusiness.com, with headquarters in Kansas City. "It's a nonstop drumbeat."

 The recommendation pertaining to cutting back on enriched grains comes from the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which is participating in the Agriculture Department's process of revising the food pyramid. The pyramid came into being in 1992.

As it now stands, the base of the food pyramid calls for 6 to 11 servings daily of bread, cereal, rice and pasta.

Eric Hentges, who leads the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, said recently that the issue of recommending people cut back on fortified grains is offset by the notion that they should increase the consumption of whole grains.

 The recommendation being bandied about calls for men to cut back on enriched grains by 51 percent and adult women to cut back by 39 percent.

"It's an issue of balance," said Hentges, who stressed that his department has not put forth any formal recommendations.

However, two professors at the Harvard School of Public Health, Walter Willett and Meir Stampfer, in 2002 came up with what they say is a healthier pyramid.

In their prototype, the base of the pyramid is daily exercise and weight control. And while the Agriculture Department's pyramid is fairly simplistic, the one from Willett and Stampfer is more complex, comprised of 11 elements, compared with six for the government's .

The next widest part of the Harvard pyramid is divided equally between whole-grain foods and plant oils, including olive, canola and peanut oils with recommendations that they be consumed at most meals.

Next comes vegetables, which are recommended "in abundance," while the suggested number of daily servings of fruit is two to three.

The next level is comprised of nuts and legumes with a recommended one to three servings a day, then fish, poultry and eggs with 0 to 2 servings a day. The next level up has dairy or calcium supplements at one to two servings. 

It also suggests multivitamins "for most people." Topping off the tip of the proposed pyramid are red meat, butter, white rice, white bread, potatoes, pasta and sweets, which are to be consumed sparingly.

Changing the dietary recommendation would be just the latest blow to the grains-based food industry, including for two large Kansas City companies. They are Interstate Bakeries Corp., the largest wholesale baker in the United States and maker of the iconic Wonder white bread, and American Italian Pasta Co., the largest pasta maker in North America.

Mark Dirkes, spokesman for Interstate Bakeries, said a recommendation that consumers cut consumption of enriched grains would be misguided. 

If people do decide to go in that direction and eat more wheat and whole-grain breads, he said, Interstate will give them what they want.

"We're in the business to sell the consumer what they want, and while we make an awful lot of white bread, we also make a lot of wheat bread," Dirkes said. "If our customers make a shift, we're willing, ready and able to address those needs."

Presently, Dirkes said about 45 percent to 50 percent of bread sold in grocery stores is white bread. He doesn't think people are going to stop buying bread, which he notes has nearly the highest penetration of any item sold at grocery stores.

 He said, however, that some of his members are concerned, although perhaps he said not as much as those at large baking companies such as Interstate.

"Our members are more readily able to adapt and develop new products than the big guys," Pyle said.

 "But certainly bread, and white bread in particular, has become a very convenient bashing point as this country talks about the obesity issue."

The government mandated fortification of certain foods beginning in the early 1940s, when it was conscripting men to fight in World War II and many were found to have vitamin deficiencies.

The program worked. Prior to the enrichment of certain foods there were 300,000 cases of pellagra, a niacin deficiency. The enrichment program has virtually eliminated pellagra.

Further, the government started requiring the addition of folic acid to certain products in the early 1990s, which has helped to reduce cases of spina bifida by 25 percent.

Sosland said the fortified grains decision would have far-reaching implications, including for the wheat-growing industry.

 He noted that per capita consumption of flour in the U.S. has already dropped from 146 pounds in 2000 to 136 in 2003.

Sosland also noted that it takes 1.8 bushels of wheat to make 100 pounds of whole wheat flour, while it takes 2.4 bushels to make the same amount of white flour.

 If everyone shifted to whole wheat and whole grain products, it would in theory drastically reduce the demand for wheat.

From his perspective, Sosland said he doesn't think that the baking industry yet realizes what sort of implications a drastic recommendation from the Agriculture Department could have on its industry and ancillary ones.

"In a war and in a fortress there are a number of walls that the enemy needs to breach," Sosland said.

 "And I don't think that people are picking up that another major wall or fortification has been breached."

Headline: College grads: Landing first job may take time
Author: Liz Boch / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
ORLANDO, Fla. - Sheena Moleta wakes up by 9:15 every morning. With her diploma from the University of Central Florida hanging above her computer, the recent marketing graduate logs on to a UCF database to check new listings for jobs in her field.

Then Moleta, dressed in the white shirt and black pants required for her current sales-manager job, sits on her bedroom floor with several folders. One is filled with copies of her resume. Another lists her job history, complete with addresses and contacts from as far back as high school. Her "Jobs" folder contains listings for the 400 positions she has applied for, the status of the applications and names and numbers for callbacks. The jobs range from salaried positions to hourly wage jobs, everywhere from Casselberry to Chicago.

During her calls, she fidgets - kneeling, sitting, lying on the floor.

Moleta figured finding a job in her field would be hard, but not this hard. She thought going to college during the recession meant that, by the time she graduated, jobs would be available and she would be competing with her fellow graduates. Little did she know that once she threw her cap in the air, she and millions like her nationwide would be dueling with those who graduated years before and have patiently waited for their own entry-level positions.

Moleta, 22, had a picture in her head. Go to college for four years, graduate in the spring, get a job in your career field by summertime. She even completed three internships to showcase "experience" on her resume. But she never planned for a summer in limbo.

"You know it's going to be hard, but you don't expect to be back where you were four years ago," Moleta said. "I just think that, in the past four years, I grew up and I'm ready, but there's this block."

Jane Cordray-Brandon, director of career services for Rollins College, said that as the job market improves, employers have their pick from "thousands and thousands of kids" looking for work. With the creation of more jobs, more people enter the search, and employers can be very selective in who they hire and the experience they prefer in new employees.

"There are too many graduates who have been out there for a while that are more qualified ... You've got previous graduates job hopping," Cordray-Brandon said. Their experience from even menial work in their field, she and other employment experts say, gives 2003 graduates an advantage.

In Moleta's 20 or so interviews, she has competed with people like Nicole Silver, a 2003 graduate of UCF with a degree in business and a minor in marketing. After graduation, she got experience by interning at a construction firm. When that ended around Christmas, she continued working full time at the Cheesecake Factory, a job she held throughout her senior year of college.

When she's not serving customers she's job-hunting, she said, adding that she's zeroing in on a position she wants.

"Since I've been out and looking around, there's much more available now than when I graduated," Silver, 23, said. "You realize when you get out of school that your degree doesn't matter and it's all about experience."

According to a survey by MonsterTrak, an online job board for students, 35 percent of 2003 graduates are still looking for a job of any kind, and only 10 percent of 2004 graduates had lined up a job before graduation, said Michelle Forker, senior vice president of Monster Campus, which like MonsterTrak, is part of Monster Worldwide.

If the class of 2004 continues that record, Moleta will have company in limbo.

Tyrone Favis Jr., a UCF graduate with a degree in business management, might have to stick it out in the Waterford Lakes Town Center Super Target job he held during college to make rent. The 22-year-old Orlando resident works in the guest services department. When he isn't working, he searches job listings for a management training position and attends UCF employment sessions.

"I remember thinking at graduation, `There are all these kids in their caps and gowns, and this is my competition,'" Favis said. "I would love entry-level right now."

Moleta has received offers for entry-level positions in her field but most have been non-salaried positions with no benefits at less than what she makes in retail. 

She lowered her salary requirements to $25,000, down from $30,000, a year. She no longer expects an employer to cover moving costs, though her battered 1993 Geo Storm probably couldn't make the trip anyway.

"You're supposed to go to school and get a job, and now I turn around and I'm exactly where I was four years ago," said Moleta, who worked in a shoe store when she started college. "There's this big gap between going to school and getting a job."

And time is running out, she said. In November, Moleta's bills will jump from $1,000 a month to $1,300 a month because she must start paying on her student loans.

"She has too much pride to ask me to pay for bills," said her mother, Donna Barnes, adding that her "go-getter" personality can easily frustrate her if she doesn't get what she wants. "When teenagers graduate, they expect, bam, you'll get handed one (a job) and make the big bucks. But she has no experience yet. She has to prove herself."

Favis thinks having internships like Moleta would have helped distinguish himself from other recent college graduates. His father, Tyrone Favis Sr. thinks so too, but Tyrone Jr., admits he thought he deserved work after spending four years earning a degree.

"There was a time when I felt entitled (to work), but not anymore," Favis said. "You have to work for a job."

His father wants him to succeed and wants to help. He offered to let Tyrone move home to Lakeland, Fla., but the son refused. That's unlike 64 percent of 2004 graduates who planned to move back in with their parents in May, according to MonsterTrak. And half of last year's graduated class still lives at home, Forker said.

Tyrone will accept financial assistance. His father gives him $200 each month for rent. 

He just dropped off the 2003 Camry Dad loaned Tyrone in exchange for a 1999 blue four-door Saturn he said was a $2,500 late graduation gift.

"I'm subsidizing my son," Favis Sr. said, adding both he and his son have learned from the experience. "I would think he would land somewhere with good work ... but I've learned it's just going to take time."

But Favis and Moleta wonder how long. Moleta is tired of student housing and roommates who change with every semester. Before work, she grabs the phone and her sticky notes (hot pink notes mean "very important") and scans the list: call Gold Coast Beverage Distributors about job. Call Laura and Christine for outside sales position at ADP. 

Call Patrick from Chipotle for local store marketing coordinator position and phone interview.

During a nearly 40-minute phone interview with the Chipotle representative, Moleta describes herself as "driven," "aggressive" and "motivated." 

In sales, she tells the interviewer, it's all about customer service and making yourself available. Call people by their first name. And, yes, she handles change well. After the interview, she rests on the floor. She expected to schedule an interview, not launch into one this morning. 

But it's OK. She still has enough time to make it to work at BCBG by 12:30 p.m.

She checks her messages on her break. She's been asked to meet Chipotle's regional director. 

The next day, after her meeting, she heads to the Chipotle on University Boulevard to try some Mexican food. She has to eat the product before she can sell it.

Her mother said that's classic Sheena. She can't sell something she doesn't believe in. Now she has to sell herself.
