Headline: Dance Marathon raises $100,138
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
What happens when you put students, faculty and alumni together inside the Golden Panther Arena for 25 hours to raise money for a cause? Dance Marathon of course. FIU kicked of its sixth annual DM, March 29 at 12 p.m. and concluded March 30, at 1 p.m.

Exceeding their goal of $100,000, DM raised a total of $100,138.13 bringing tears of joy to almost everyone's eyes. 

"I am very grateful for all the dancers and all the people that gave up their Saturday night and their social lives to come together for this wonderful cause," junior Janice Borges said.   	

For 25 hours no one was allowed to leave the GPA unless they were a moraler. Moralers kept the dancers motivated and did so by taking shifts.

Motivation was also induced by other means, such as speakers and entertainment.

Motivational speaker Carl Johnson was brought in. In addition to this, four miracle families came and spoke about their child's condition, how the Children's Miracle Network has helped and how they  appreciate the work that the FIU community has done for the organization.

"Listening to the children's stories seriously helps because there comes a point where people are so tired that they want to give up and the speeches help remind them of why we are doing what we do," Marc Silver, Morale Captain and fifth year DM member, said.

One of the most touching stories came from 3-year-old Shea Garcia, who was diagnosed with leukemia when he was a couple months old. Garcia went through three different relapses. When he went through the third one, it turned out to be that he needed a bone marrow transplant.

"Luckily enough, Shea was able to get his transplant thanks to CMN and he was able to come be with us [at DM] and play with us for over 4 hours," Family Relations Chairperson Alexandra Campuzano said.  

"Entertainment was the biggest key component in keeping everyone up," Entertainment Chairperson Marly Quincoces said, "Music played a huge role."

There were DJs from local radio stations as well as our very own Radiate 88. In addition to DJs, live bands performed.

"Even though it is a dance marathon, we also had different types of performances," Quincoces said. "Yamil Piedra did stand up comedy and dressed up as a huge iguana type creature named Guaca. The morale captains had to put together theme hours which ranged from Scooby Doo to MTV's Spring Break."

The entertainment committee also planned events that were done individually or in small groups.

"From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., there was rock climbing and bungee running and from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. we had megatron laser tag," said Quincoces.

There was also a high striker, where one hits the machine with a sledge hammer and makes the dial hit the bell, arcade machines, human monopoly and balls to play volleyball, basketball or football.

One activity brought everyone together up front and center. Morale captains put together a compilation of songs ranging from oldies to rap and came up with a line dance. 

"The dance is learned in separate chunks, so that by the end of the event the whole dance gets learned and everyone is doing it together," Alumni Advisor Sara Lewis said. 

Food was also used to keep people up.

Food donations were provided by Papa John Pizza, Longhorn Steakhouse, Blue Sky and several bakeries. There were also snacks like pretzels, popcorn, and fruit roll-ups. Water was donated by Crystal Springs.

Before every meal or snack, committee members and morale captains got onstage and geared the crowd in a food chant: "Food we gotta have it. Food we gotta have it. We got a bag of cheese."

No one was allowed to sit except when eating or getting a caricature done. 

"The only person who did get to sit, aside from when everyone else could, was the musical chair winner. She was allowed to sit for 20 seconds,"  Media Relations Patsy Rodon said.

Aside from not being able to sit, dancers and moralers were also not allowed to know the time. Only committee members and entertainment chairs were allowed to know. 

Planning for DM started in July 2002 and fundraising for the event started in fall 2002. 

"We've had several events such as Mini DM, where a pep rally was held to kick things off which lasted for two hours," DM Director Christy Carbot said. "We also had L.Y.P.S. which was a lip synching contest, DM book or records day, a silent auction which alone raised $800 and CMN balloons." 

The amount of money raised throughout the year was kept secret until the closing ceremonies.

"We try to keep it a secret so that if we are under people don't get discouraged, and if we are over, they won't stop giving," Assistant Director of Finances Alex Corzo said.

The closing ceremony took place on March 30. Awards for most spirited dancer, most spirited moraler and most spirited morale captain were given. Also, the coveted "Miracle Cup" which goes to the organization that raises the most money was given to Student Programming Council. 

"SPC held car washes and did canning to help raise money for DM," Corzo said. 

FIU President Maidique came to the event and showed his support and appreciation to all those who dedicated their time to the CMN.

"I think this is great for two reasons," Maidique said. "First, students are joining together voluntarily, and secondly because I am delighted that our beneficiary is Miami Children's Hospital because they are a partner and a supporter of FIU's nursing program."	

Finally, wrapping things up, everyone present held hands and formed a huge heart, inside the arena, to the song "Angels Among Us" by Alabama, to reflect and give thanks for all their hard work and how it has paid off. 

Their main motive "It's all for the kids" was continuously heard throughout the event in chants, cheers and screams.

Headline: BBC SGC candidates face off
Author: Alejandra Diaz/ Biscayne Bay Editor
&nbsp;
In front of a large crowd of interested students, Student Government Association candidates took their places on the podium at the "Face-Off" debates.

On March 27, the Biscayne Bay Campus' Student Government Council officially presented next year's potential student government officials at a debate at Wolfe University Center's Panther Square.  Free food was promised to a hungry crowd of students after the debate, but this wasn't the only reason students stuck around.

"I wanted to see what the candidates had to offer...the food and giveaways were just a bonus," Jennifer Otero, junior, advertising, said.

The hour-long program gave students a chance to witness their potential SGC leaders deliver their platforms and their hopes for the upcoming year.

After the candidates  delivered their speeches, Director of Campus Life and Orientation David Cole asked questions relating to the candidates' achievements, platforms and the ideas about the main challenges facing BBC.

As part of his 2003-2004 platform, current BBC-SGC Vice President Alexander Lewy, who is running for BBC-SGC president, hopes to create easier access to professor evaluations and reintroduce paper syllabi. He said that his relationship with administration is better than his opposition's relationships are, and that will ensure he will get things done.

Also running for president, Rasheedah Muhammad's agenda includes increasing the amount of scholarships available to students. Muhammad was part of SGC for four months and later became a resident assistant at Bay Vista housing.

"Plans are already in the works, but if I am elected president, I will work to increase the amount of scholarships available to students," Muhammad said.

Another presidential candidate, current SGC finance chair Nicaise Parillon's platform includes improving customer service on campus and increasing class offerings.  Parillon says that her primary focus is on allocating fees that should go toward achieving her goals if elected.  She said that she is not running to promote SGC but to promote student issues and resolve them.

"Your concerns are my concerns; your issues are my issues," Parillon said. 

Lewy hopes to improve communication between BBC's and University Park's SGCs by writing a university-wide bylaw stating that both councils must meet once a month. 

This came after a confrontation by both Muhammad and Parillon when they agreed that as current vice president, Lewy should have taken care of the problem already.

In his defense, Lewy said "I don't have the final say in this administration...it's not my fault that they didn't meet all year."

Running for the BBC-SGC vice president position this year are Admatha Israel, Ruth-Allyson Webster and Clayton "Hank" Schramm. 

As part of his platform for this year, Israel's plan includes increasing student involvement in Student Organization Council clubs and addressing the housing phone problem and pest problem.

Hardly argumentative during the debate, Israel agreed with his opponents and even commended them for their views but later admitted that public speaking is not his best suit. 

"I want a harmonious relationship with all organizations and to try to increase voting numbers as well as help the Haitian Student Organization," Israel said.

Webster's agenda includes ensuring satisfactory customer service for all students and having food locations stay open later.  Webster said that her experience with SGC as the director of Special Events will enable her to attack the customer service problem students are facing and instill a plan that will charge a 5 percent fee to temporarily remove student registration holds during registration week.

"I'm not here to glorify myself, so I will not get into the politics of what I've done in the past, but I will get into what I can do for the future," Webster said.  

Schramm, current director of Student Lobbying,  began his speech with a list of some of the things he had done during the past year. This includes lobbying for the Bright Futures scholarship and trying to secure money for a new journalism building. 

He was a lower division representative for the 2002-2003 year. Schramm also hopes to lock the rate for international student insurance rates at 20 percent.

"As director of Student Lobbying, I've given us political connections and made a name for FIU," Schramm said. 

Schramm contested that Webster's plan of a 5 percent fee to remove registration holds is pie in the sky because, he says, not everyone will be willing to pay to remove their holds.

Disagreeing with Schramm, Webster retorted by insisting on knowing how Schramm was going to lock the international student insurance rates if he has yet to secure anything. Schramm maintained that he has been working on a locked rate for some time now and is certain that if elected he will be able to go through with this plan.

There are four candidates running for the lower division representative positions this year and although they were not able to participate in the debate, they were there in support of their fellow candidates.

Also present at the debate were Merdochey T. LaFrance and Kattia Latino, both running for representative at-large, and Raul Quintero, who is running for College of Health and Urban Affairs representative.

Voting will take place on April 1 and 2 in the Enrollment Center (AC-1 100) from 9 a.m.- 7 p.m. The winners will be announced on April 3 in WUC's Panther Square at noon during an Election Announcement Party. For more information call BBC-SGC at 305-919-5680.

Headline: Tavis Smiley lecture to kick off BBC's Spring Fling
Author: John Morris/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As part of Biscayne Bay Campus' Spring Fling, political commentator and talk show personality Tavis Smiley will speak to students.

The free event, sponsored by student government and the Lectures Committee, will take place in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom (WUC 244) on April 7 at 7p.m.  Smiley will lecture on "Diversity and Multiculturalism: A National Perspective."  The lecture will be followed by a question and answer session. Smiley will also be signing copies of his new book "Keeping the Faith: Stories of Love, Courage, Healing and Hope from Black America."

Tickets are already being given out at the BBC Campus Life office, and Zapata expects all the tickets to be gone before the event takes place.

Smiley was asked to talk to students after a Campus Life poll of students voted for him.

"We did a student survey over a month ago," said David Cole, associate director for Campus Life & Orientation.  "Out of all the names, he was the top choice."

Some students are interested in knowing what Smiley thinks about current events.

"I want to see his views on Iraq, Bush and what he thinks the future will bring," sophomore Roldy Blot said.

A lot of students are familiar with Smiley through his radio appearances.

"Most students know him through his show on BET and his appearances on the Tom Joyner show on Hot 105 FM," Cole said. "I think the students are going to get an honest and relevant presentation.  He's very connected to younger audiences, especially college students." 

Zapata thinks students are going to learn a lot from Smiley's lecture.

"He is an excellent speaker and world-known. He is very respected in the field of journalism.  African New World studies and journalism students will get the most out of his lecture," Zapata said.

Smiley was recently voted one of Time's 50 most promising young leaders and is the first African American to host his own show on National Public Radio.  He has interviewed political figures like Bill Clinton and Fidel Castro.  

He is also the founder of The Tavis Smiley Foundation, which is a non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging and enlightening black youth. 

SGA and the Lectures Committe paid $29,000 to put on this event, Cole said.

Headline: Dazzlers to attend nationals for first time in 7 years
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
They shake, bump, jump, strut their stuff and are making noise to let everyone know that they are here and plan on staying. The Dazzlers have returned full force this year to FIU and the college dance championships.

Fourteen ladies will be representing FIU and the Dazzlers in the National Dance Alliance/Chick-Fil-A dance championships in Daytona, Fla. Only 11 will actually be competing. They arrive on April 2. Preliminary rounds are on April 3 and finals are April 4.

During the summer, these ladies took off to the National Cheerleading Alliance / National Dance Alliance camp in Kentucky. There they learned the routines that they have been performing for FIU crowds at football games and more recently at basketball games.

In January, the girls began practicing twice a week for three hours each day,  and working on their routine for the competition. 

"It's been a while since the team has attended this competition, which is why we've been practicing so hard - so we can go and show everyone there what the FIU  dance team is all about," junior and third-year member Maite Maguregui said.

The last time the ladies attended nationals was in 1996, when they placed eighth. In 1995, they received third and second place in two different divisions. Their best year was in 1992, when they became national champs.

The Dazzlers will put on a two minute and 15 second routine that will be judged on technique, precision, appearance and execution. 

Based on video performances, the Dazzlers are currently ranked tenth next to Harvard and Georgetown.  

"The girls aren't going with a mentality of getting first place; It's the first time they compete since 1996," Dazzlers Coach and former Dolphins' cheerleader Brenda Popritkin said. "They are just looking forward to placing in the top five." 

Popritkin said one of their main goals  is to make a name for FIU and the Dazzlers once again. 

"We haven't competed in a long time so I am looking forward to seeing FIU's name in a different area. It's been a lot of hard work, and we just want to get back and rank once again," junior Paulina Munoz said.

The dancers endured many struggles, Popritkin said. They started out with 23 girls, 9 of which quit. After they came back from camp, it was straight to football season. Some of the girls quit because they could not handle the practices, appearances, plus schoolwork.

Two weeks ago the girls went full throttle, practicing Monday through Friday in order to perfect their routines. 

The total cost of attending this competition is $8,500. They have received funding from the athletic department, Student Government Association and Panther Rage. Most of the money they raised from bake sales and appearances.

The three girls that are not performing still attend all the rehearsals. Senior Cristi Pineiro decided to not perform because her teaching internship prevents her from putting in a lot of hours practicing. 

"It was going to be very hard working and teaching all day and then coming to practice and trying my very hardest to put 100 percent into the team," Pineiro said. "It wouldn't be fair to the team, Ms. Popritkin or myself."

Headline: Student soldiers put off college, go to war
Subheadline: Soldiers' relatives worry, await their safe return
Author: Angela Castillo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Twenty-year-old Jasmani Riveron is one of the many Army Reserve members recently called up for duty.  
Riveron, a chemistry major at FIU, bid farewell to his family four months ago and is now stationed in a military base in Kansas. He will be transferred to Virginia in May, where he will wait to be deployed somewhere in the Middle East. 
As of press time, the Pentagon has confirmed that about 130,000 U.S troops would be deployed to the Persian Gulf region in the next few days. Pentagon officials have also confirmed 59 coalition deaths in the war.
In consequence, friends and family of soldiers are more concerned about the wellbeing of their loved ones everyday. And although most of these families are proud regardless of the feelings of fear and uncertainty the war has brought up, they are trying to no longer question, but accept their relative's decision to defend the country. 
"My dad is very open-minded and he thinks that if my brother, God forbid, dies in the war, it was meant to be; it was his destiny," Jasmani's sister Zuleika Riveron, a broadcast journalism major at FIU, said.
 "And if he comes back, it's an experience my brother had gone through," Riveron added. "My dad is going to be proud no matter what. My mother doesn't talk about the situation. She is worried, but she knows it was my brother's choice and she has always supported him." 
On Thursday, President Bush announced that the conflict will last "however long it takes to win." 
The latest news has not only alarmed, but also banished the hope of Vanessa Ramirez's family to have her brother back home soon. Ramirez, a print journalism student, has a 19-year-old brother named Eddy serving in the U.S Coast Guard as a Fire Technician.
Ramirez's family, who is still allowed to contact "FT3 Ramirez" by phone, was expecting the war to come to an end in about a month, which is the period of time her brother is supposed to wait before being shipped off to the Persian Gulf.
The war is not only affecting the families of soldiers, but the soldiers as well. It has changed the life of many Army Reserves like Riveron, who had started to pursue his career goals. 
"[The war] is somehow taking away many of my plans, it is backing me up big time," Riveron said, "but I don't regret [it] because somebody has to take care of the country; if we don't do it, who else is going to do it? Besides, I know that it will have its benefits in the future." 
In his position as Transportation Management coordinator, "Specialist Riveron" is responsible for deploying soldiers overseas. He said the experience is a bit depressing. 
"I feel sad to see people leaving; I see their families crying, and even though I know it is part of the mission, I can't help to feel that way," he said. 
Frank Gonzalez, a senior majoring in criminal justice, is in the Marine Reserves. He says soldiers should trust their abilities, follow the military strategies, and above all, focus on the mission that is not to be a hero, but to liberate Iraq from a dictatorship. 
To the families and friends of soldiers, he said, "Try to think of the positive outcome of the war, and whenever you write to [the soldiers,] be encouraging and always remind them that you hope to see him soon, or that you can't wait for him to be home, because it is important for them to know that they have something to look afterwards." 
Frank said that "if worse comes to worse" he will be deployed. 
Gonzalez has been trying to contact his best friend Israel, known as Lance-Corporal Valdes, who is serving in Kuwait. Valdes, 27, joined the Marine Corps two years ago as a way of coping with the divorce he was going through, according to Gonzalez. 
The emotional impact of the war is affecting the lifestyle of some friends and family members of soldiers, disrupting their sleep patterns and preventing them from concentrating on their daily duties. 
"We don't sleep as much since the war started," Vanessa Ramirez said. "I'm not the one who gets up at night and walks around the house, but my mom and dad do get up a lot, and it's really affecting our sleep." 
"Resilience in a time of war" is the title of an article posted on the American Psychological Association website (www.apa.org). Dr. Shepeard, who works at FIU's Counseling and Psychological Services Center, recommended the website to people who are having difficulty dealing with the psychological implications of the war. 
The article provides guidelines to adapting to unexpected changes and managing stress and feelings of anxiety and uncertainty related to war.  For more information, contact CPSC at 305-348-2434 or 305-919-5305.

Headline: Event showcases Colombian culture
Author: Giannina Vasquez
&nbsp;
The Colombian Student Association, whose mission is to unite, help and inform the Colombian community, will be doing just that during Esencia Colombia (Essence Colombia).

The event, which will be the first dedicated to promoting Colombian culture at FIU, will take place April 1 - 3.

The event is being organized by members of the Colombian Student Association (COLSA) in conjunction with the Latin American and Caribbean Center and the Hispanic Organizations Committee.

"This event will be the window to show our community the literature, art, food and music of our country," COLSA President Sergio Arenas said.

The Colombian Consulate as well as several non-profit organizations will be participating. 

"The event is a contribution from many people," Moreno said. "It will be interesting and diverse."

Even though 14 out of the 16 events will be presented in Spanish, the inauguration will be in English to give non-Spanish speakers who are interested in Colombian culture a chance to know what the event is all about, Robert Valencia, sophomore and Public Relations representative for COLSA, said. 

"The idea of the event is to show all the good things Colombia has," Valencia said. "We want people to know that Colombia is not only about drugs and violence," said Valencia.

The inauguration will take place April 1 from 4 - 5 p.m. in GC 243. COLSA President Sergio Arenas and Eduardo Gamarra, LACC director and FIU professor, will give an overview of the events.

A presentation entitled "Oral Tradition and Written Word of the Colombian Caribbean" will be given by Colombian author David Sanchez Juliao on April 2 from 5 - 6:30 p.m. in GL 220.

Sanchez Juliao was an ambassador to India and Egypt and has written extensively about Latin American and Caribbean ethnicity and idiosyncrasies. 

 "I think it's a very good thing that they are changing people's view of Colombia and its people," said junior Juan Pablo Rivera. "The event is positive in that it gives students a chance to learn more and have a different attitude towards such a beautiful country," Rivera added. 

Closing ceremonies will be on April 3 at 9:30 a.m. in the DM amphitheatre.  Alternative rock group De Paso Por El Mundo and David Garcia will perform in concert.

Headline: Israel plans to increase FIU's full time equivalents
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Junior Admatha Israel hopes to take his experience as rep at-large to the vice presidential office at the Biscayne Bay Campus in the upcoming student government elections.

While studying at Miami-Dade Community College, Israel, a psychology and political science double major, earned associate's degrees in psychology and photographic technology; an education which, Israel believes,  allows him to relate to a diverse group of colleagues.

Israel has also worked at Precision Response Corp. and Omnitech GenCorp, where he trained and evaluated employees. He is currently working as a freelance photographer and  a freelance writer.  He is working on several non-fiction books.

"My experience," Israel said, "allows me to excel in my endeavors as well as understand issues my colleagues have not yet experienced."

Between his education and his experience, Israel believes he has a firm grasp of many issues including the drug war, voting, politics, campus housing and Bright Futures scholarships.

Israel believes apathy is a problem in student government, as well as among the student body and community. 

"I would solve [apathy] by creating a volunteer committee committed to encouraging involvement in social affairs like voting," Israel said.

Israel plans to develop a program to increase full time equivalents (students who are enrolled in at least 15 credits each semester) through a compromise between the University Park campus and BBC, as well as expanding student organizations on campus by working with organizations such as the Peace Corps and increasing student involvement in Student Organization Council clubs.

He would also like to develop a business student-pairing project for fund raising. Keying in on housing students, he plans to resolve issues with phone services and pest infestation.

He also hopes to expand plans for a new gym at BBC to include a boxing ring.

Isreal said if he is elected, he hopes to "continue to grow and learn and develop [his] skills to become a more effective leader."

Headline: UP debate free of personal attacks
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
This year's University Park Student Government Council candidates debate went well and was cleaner than past debates, students, candidates and organizers said. 

The debate was held March 26 at the GC Forum. 

Before the presidential and vice presidential candidates squared off, lower division representative candidates were each given one minute to deliver their platform, and representative at large candidates were given two minutes.

"I think I did a pretty good job," Rep at Large candidate Malik Wilkes said. "It's kind of hard to get everything in two minutes, but I went over my high points."

Debate moderator John Stack, an FIU professor and director of the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship Studies, introduced the two presidential tickets and gave them each five minutes to present their platforms before he began asking them questions.  

Each question was directed towards a particular ticket, which was given one minute to respond. The other ticket was given 30 seconds for a rebuttal.  

"How will you promote togetherness in a time of war?" Stack asked.

"We need to have more programs promoting patriotism," Jorge Rosario, UP-SGC presidential candidate, said. "We all need to work together to be as one.  FIU is one university."

Rosario's running mate Ana Manrara added that they need to unite students at all locations and campuses.

"Students in [the Graham Center] feel like part of FIU," Manrara said. "Those outside of GC don't, so we need to reach out to those students."

After Stack finished asking questions, the audience was given an opportunity to query the candidates.

When one audience member raised concerns about insufficient parking, both tickets said the impending construction of two new parking garages will solve the problem.

Another audience member asked the candidates what they would do for the students.  

"We're not here to clean up a lake," Ron Hollis, vice presidential candidate on the Solomon ticket, said. "Not that that's a bad thing, but there are bigger, better issues that need to be addressed.

"We are going to implement long term services that will benefit students for years to come," Hollis added.

One audience member raised a question that put the two presidential candidates at odds. "Do you believe in the letter of the law or the spirit of the law?" he asked.

"SGA is a business with a $7 million budget," Solomon responded. "We need to follow the written law to the tee."

Rosario disagreed with Solomon.

"I'm the opposite," Rosario said. "There are cases where if you follow the letter of the law, you wouldn't be able to compromise.  I'm a down to earth guy and I listen to students.  I'm all about spirit of the law."

When an audience member asked how the candidates felt about having an open- door policy, both tickets said they agreed with such a policy.

"We are not above you, we are one of you," Manrara said.

Junior Sheeba Jones watched the debate.

"I thought it was very informative," Jones said. "A lot of concerns were brought to the table. It will be a tough campaign."

After watching the debate, Jones said she will vote for Solomon and Hollis because she thinks Hollis' experience as SPC president will enable them to get more students to participate in school events.  However, Jones said the Rosario ticket has been more aggressive in marketing their campaign.

"The campaign is going amazing," Rosario said. "We've started off strong and we've been able to keep the momentum."

Rosario said he thought the debate went very well.

"Ana and I stuck to what we wanted to talk about," Rosario said. "Ana and I are down to earth and I think we came off that way."

Junior Ralph Solernou, who is campaigning for the Rosario ticket, said both tickets presented themselves well, but he will vote for Rosario and Manrara.

"Jorge and Ana are more in tune with the students," Solernou said. "That to me is the best point they have."

"I think both tickets did well," Solomon said, "but I think I have a stronger platform."

During the debate, Solomon and Hollis were cut off a few times for exceeding the time limit. But Solomon doesn't think that hurt his campaign.

"Ron and I have a lot to say," Solomon said. "We've done our research."

Sophomore Alina Garcia, who is campaigning for the Solomon ticket, thought Solomon outshined Rosario in the debate.

"Clayton has more experience and it was evident in his answers," Garcia said.

One thing that was missing from this year's debate was personal attacks. 

UP-SGC Elections Commissioner Cynthia Fraga said personal attacks were a problem in past debates.

"[This year] the candidates are very professional," Fraga said.

Even the candidates noticed the difference.

"This debate was the cleanest one I've ever seen," Solomon said.

The professionalism and maturity of the candidates help refute some of the negative perceptions of SGA that students have, Jessica Morffi, current UP-SGC president, said. 

Morffi said both tickets have strong platforms, and they "are really focusing on the students."

 With voting scheduled for April 1 and 2, the question remains: Who will win?

"My prediction is it's going to be the closest [election] ever," Solomon said. "They are both strong tickets.  No matter what, SGA will be in good hands."

Headline: Schramm: lock international student health fees
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
At 17, junior Clayton "Hank" Schramm has accomplished more than the majority of people his age, and he is hoping to add to that list.

Schramm, who is currently the director of student lobbying for the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council, is running for BBC-SGC vice president.  

"BBC is smaller and we have a lot less resources, but we have a lot of heart," he said.

Schramm entered FIU at the age of 15, after skipping two years of elementary school and earning 27 college credits during 12th grade in the School for Advanced Studies dual enrollment program at Miami-Dade Community College. He has had two years of experience in SGA, serving in both the executive and legislative branches. He was named Representative of the Year last year while serving as lower division representative, and he is the current Florida Student Association chairman of governmental relations.

If elected, Schramm wants to lock the rate of international students' health insurance; start an online magazine for students in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication; lobby the federal government for funds to construct a new SJMC building; and secure a reduced fare on metro buses for FIU students.  

He also wants to increase campus life at BBC by holding Panther Jam, a huge outdoor concert with rap and reggae artists.

"Concerts may or may not work out at University Park, but we haven't tried anything in that magnitude up at Biscayne Bay, and we have a beautiful location for it," Schramm said.

Schramm also wants to restructure the First Year Experience class to make it more of a platform for students to get involved in Campus Life.  He said the current class curriculum neither promotes student involvement nor fosters learning.

In addition, Schramm wants to increase voter registration among students; develop a mentorship program that pairs freshmen and transfer students with upperclassmen; and partner with local hotels to increase internships for hospitality management students.  

An insufficient amount of computers in Bay Vista housing is another issue Schramm wants to address.  There are currently 11 computers for about 400 students, Schramm said, and they are outdated.  There is no reason Student Government cannot purchase more computers for housing, he said.

"If I get elected, the day of I will put in that purchase order," Schramm said.

Another concern Schramm has is the communication problem between the UP-SGC and the BBC-SGC, which he attributes to councils' decision not to have university-wide meetings this year.  The councils should meet together once a month, he said, because they would both be more efficient if they met on a regular basis.

"If we aren't moving in synch, it's hard for us to get things done," Schramm said.

He said his "connections" and "clear vision" are two reasons he should be elected as BBC vice president. And he is confident that he will achieve his goals.

"Everything I've set out to do, I've accomplished," Schramm said.

Headline: BBC finance chair runs for president
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Junior Nicaise Parillon wants to keep the office of Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council president in the family. 

Parillon hopes to succeed her husband, current BBC-SGC President Adrian Carter, who will be graduating this semester, in that position.

Parillon is currently the finance chair for BBC-SGC - a position that she has held for two years.  Prior to that, she was a lower division representative, senate pro-tempore and she served on the International Student Services and Finance committees.

"I am in [student government] for the right reasons - to serve the student body," Parillon said. 

Her "Five Star Plan" includes improving customer service, creating a student media outlet, establishing an international student eye and dental care plan, increasing class offerings and improving computer labs.

Establishing a university-wide mentorship program, which would pair incoming freshamn with juniors or seniors, is also important, Parillon said.

The communication problem between the University Park and BBC SGCs is another issue of concern to Parillon.

"Communication is key," she said. "More meetings between the two leaderships need to be held to ensure everyone knows what's going on."

Parillon said her experience and personal characteristics make her the best presidential candidate.

"I understand the process and I have the competency for the job," she said. "I am highly responsible."

Headline: As president Muhammed would 'elevate BBC council, make it more effective'
Author: Lisa Cawley / News Editor
&nbsp;
Junior Rasheeda Muhammed is among the three candidates eyeing the position of Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council president.

With two years in her current position as College Of Health and Urban Affairs representative, Muhammed feels ready to take her experience to the next level.

"Not only do I have leadership experience on the council, I have a strong desire to elevate the Biscayne Bay Student Government Council and make it more effective," Muhammed said. "I also feel that this University does not listen to the needs of students as it should and as [BBC-SGC] president, I want our voices heard."

Muhammed is also a resident assistant for Bay Vista housing.

If elected, she wants to provide a shuttle to and from one campus to the next whenever there is a main event, submit a proposal to add lights to the soccer field on BBC and establish an International student and out of state Student Scholarship Fund.

 Creating a website for FIU students to sell their used books directly to each other would also be another goal for Muhammed as president.  When students sell their books to the bookstore, "they are getting much less than their books are actually worth," Muhammed said.

Another item on Muhammed's platform is reducing the $50 processing fee that housing students on financial aid incur to defer payment.	

Lack of student involvement in BBC-SGC is one problem Muhammed would like to see resolved.

	"I see the lack of interest in student government among the students as crippling to the efforts of Student Government," she said. "I would create a medium between students and the council where they can voice their opinions and so students' issues can be more adequately addressed."

Headline: Faith in our troops, not our cause
Author: E.R. Ship / Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
A friend said the other day, "For some reason the country seems to be going to hell in a handbasket. I can't figure it out."

Who can? The United States has resorted to armed force rather than inspections, sanctions and containment to deal with whatever threat it was that Iraq represented to world peace. 

Who can say absolutely and positively at this point that our nation is doing the right thing? Who can say the suffering and loss of life on both sides is absolutely unavoidable?

If you are sure - without even a shred of uncertainty - then raise your hands the way dozens did the other day when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked the congregation at Bridge Street African Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, "How many people here have a loved one or a friend who is overseas in the military?"

I imagine there are people who have no doubts about what's happening, but I also imagine that most of us, like the Oscar winners at the Academy Awards, are trying to make sense of it all. 

And like some of those celebrities, sometimes making fools of ourselves while trying to do so.

But who can blame us? We are at war. We're not supposed to be shocked that some of "our" people have been killed or taken hostage by "the enemy." 

Yet the images, the reports are a shock.

We turn to our churches, our synagogues, our mosques - our faith - but even then many of us are left confused and fearful. 

If you are black in America, you are familiar with war.

As the Rev. David Cousin said in his sermon Sunday, with Bloomberg in attendance: "War is no stranger to us. We fight the war of crime every day in the streets of New York. We fight every day in the war on drugs. We fight war, racism and classism and sexism every day."

All true. But the war in Iraq is real people in a shooting war whose aims we are still uncertain of. 

We're angry. We cannot figure out whether Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is alive or dead or whether a facility our side bombed the heck out of was a chemical plant or not. 

We cannot find Osama bin Laden or even figure out whether he's alive in a cave somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan. 

Or whether he has anything to do with Iraq.

Tony Blair, the British prime minister, offered his condolences Monday to the families and friends of those who've been lost while strongly supporting the war he's made part of his mission - "a war," he says, "not of conquest but of liberation."

At the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on Sunday, retired Bishop Paul Moore articulated just as strongly the other side of this confusing and frustrating debate. 

"It appears we have two types of religion here," he said. "One is a solitary Texas politician who says, 'I talk to Jesus and I am right.' The other involves millions of people of all faiths who disagree."

At my church on Sunday, we were instructed to trust in the Lord, though not necessarily in President Bush. We were urged to support the men and women - "our young people on this battlefield," in the words of Gen. Tommy Franks - with prayers. 

We left fired up by the Rev. Calvin Butts' sermon, but still frustrated.

My faith wants clarity. But, quite frankly, like a good number of us who are listening but not hearing enough, I remain confused.

Headline: SGA election promises  mixed bag of issues
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
If you've passed through any student center on campus lately, several campaigners pushing their respective candidate in the upcoming student government elections have probably accosted you. 

In fact, you might be clutching a fistful of flyers and rushing through what bears more than a passing resemblance to a war zone. 

Here's a tip to get you through: grab a flyer, sticker or any other campaign paraphernalia. Carry it in the most conspicuous manner possible. Most of the campaigners, barring only the most aggressive vicious types, will leave you alone under the assumption that your vote is spoken for. Consider it a hall pass. But I digress.

What I meant to get to was The Issues. 

As of fall head counts, there are 3252 international students enrolled at FIU. International students pay $399.23 per credit compared to $83.72 for Florida residents. In addition, due to cuts in state funding, students are facing a 7 percent to 12 percent tuition increase. 

Of course the best way to appeal to a voting block is to appeal to their pocket, especially a demographic under such financial duress. So it comes as no surprise that international students find themselves a high priority of many candidates. 

Presently, SGA sponsors one $500 scholarship for international students. That's not a lot of help for international students at Florida International University. Not much international about that.

The fate of Bright Futures scholarships is another issue that's being tossed around. Well, really more of a non-issue. 

The program, which rewards students who achieve high marks in high school, came under after budget cuts put the state in a tight financial position. 

At this point, the reality is that the scholarship will undergo some change. Details are hazy, as lawmakers mull over how best to handle the changes, but changes are inevitable. 

The best student leaders can do is to ensure they have some say in how it is changed through lobbying, but the decision is out of the hands of students at this point.

Despite assurances from administrators, concerns about water at Biscayne Bay Campus housing have been expressed by housing students. Administrators hold that the water is safe, however the muddy-colored water has some students worried. And failing phone lines at BBC housing also have students uneasy.

Another campaign idea had an ATM being placed at the engineering campus, and another being placed at the towers. 

An ATM at the engineering campus might prove a useful convenience on a campus that just now is catching up in terms of creature comforts to its two sibling campuses. 

However, an ATM at the University Park Towers just doesn't make sense. 

This isn't the first time the placement of an ATM at the towers has been proposed. Three years ago, the feasibility of such a project was investigated. 

In the end, students felt that the $30,000 yearly it would take to operate an ATM simply wasn't worthwhile, especially with two ATMs located at the Graham Center.

Currently, the "ATM is not high on the list of priorities" for housing, Jim Wassenaar, director of housing, said. "It would have to be a student government initiative."

It doesn't seem to me that's an initiative worth taking.Those flyers promise a lot of things, but some of those promises aren't always feasible. Some are encouraging signs that student leaders are sensitive to the demands of students.

 Those expectations, like most of these campaigns are a mixed bag.

Headline: Freshman sees first action
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU redshirt freshman Josh Padrick who hails from Merritt Island, Fla., was given his first opportunity to take snaps with the first-team offense last week to begin the spring practice period. 

Last year's starter, Jamie Burke is expect to sit out of the spring to rest from a shoulder injury which forced him out of the teams' final contest of 2002 against Florida Atlantic on Nov. 23. 

As a result, Padrick now has a chance to climb the depth chart although no one expects anyone but Burke to be the teams starter in the fall.
Head Coach Don Strock inserted Padrick to guide the offense from the shotgun formation as well as the regular offense.

"Josh is very athletic with a live arm," Strock said. "He impressed us last year running the scout team. Now, we need to see him running our offense. I anticipate that he'll be taking a lot of snaps during our two scrimmages."

Padrick caught the attention of college recruiters while playing quarterback at Merritt Island High School. There he was named an All-Space Coast Conference performer and threw for over 1,300 yards as a senior and ran for another 486. Additionally, he was a state qualifier as a track high jumper and runs the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds.

His background as a running quarterback who is very familiar running the option offense will not change the pass-oriented way moving the ball that FIU used in 2002.

"The offense won't change, but how he handles a particular situation might," said offensive coordinator Greg Briner. "He might scramble where as one of our other quarterbacks might hold the ball and look for a receiver."

"Down at the goal line he gives us more options because he can run the option or keep it and go," Strock said. 

"We know he can drop back and throw it. He's got a quick release and a good arm and we're expecting big things out of him. He's a very competitive kid."

Headline: Football begins spring practice
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The 2003 version of the FIU football team took to the gridiron for its spring practice period at the Community Stadium field.

Head Coach Don Strock put his players through a 90 minute workout on Friday before giving his troops the weekend off. The day marked the first time the offensive unit ran sets from the shotgun formation. Additionally, redshirt quarterback Josh Padrick (Merritt Island, Fla.) saw some action running the offense. This was a new method used by Strock. During last season's spring practice Jamie Burke, FIU's starter for the 2002 season, and David Tabor took every snap.

"We worked on [the shotgun] a little today," Strock said. "It's something we'll basically use on third down situations. It's new for everyone and the spring is a great time to work on it."

The team practiced five times this past week and have 10 more scheduled workouts before the annual Blue/Gold scrimmage on April 12. 
"I was overall pleased with this week. The guys worked hard and I can't complain about their efforts," Strock said. "As they've matured and gotten older, they've made fewer mistakes. That's how you win football games."

A point of concern for the offense is in the backfield. Who will emerge from a tight pack as the teams starting running back? Returning for FIU are Rashod Smith and Jerrid Lundstedt. Smith rushed for 784 yards which included a 262-yard performance in a victory over Jacksonville on Halloween night. Smith also scored nine times for the Golden Panthers. But the Northwestern High School alumnus did this after original starter Tori Robinson was sidelined with a badly injured right ankle after the inaugural contest against St. Peter's. Robinson had surgery to remove bone spurs from the ankle over the winter. He continues to practice despite doing so with an obvious limp.

"Right now, he's a little rusty and limping a bit," said new running backs coach and former Miami Dolphin Tony Nathan. "But it's my job to push him and let him know that he can do it. He's still a little bit away but hopefully, next week he'll be 100 percent and ready to go."

Lundstedt finished the year with 405 rushing and 128 receiving yards. He too was used after injuries limited the options coming out of the backfield. But Lundstedt's solid play against Florida Atlantic, where he rushed for 112 yards, makes him another possible offensive threat for the season.

Also vying for a position on the depth chart are two players that are currently sitting out the spring nursing injuries. Diamos Demerritt, a transfer from the University of Minnesota, and Dravian Jones   hope to challenge for spots.

The Golden Panthers were also introduced to the 3-4 defense by Strock during the week. This was another new addition to the unit's arsenal. 
FIU rarely used anything other than their 4-3 alignment during the 2002 campaign. 

"We think we have talented-enough personnel to play the 4-3, 3-4 and our CAT defense-the five-man line," Strock said. "During the fall, we only have limited time to prepare for an opponent. But in the spring, we've got the time to experiment and implement new formations. Hopefully, come September, we'll be able to mix all these different defenses and that should only make us a better football team."

Strock has been focused on Pedro Farias and Ronni Silva to head the three-man front FIU will be working to use in the fall.

Farias transferred to FIU after playing his freshman season at Glenville State College in West Virginia. He was an All-Broward performer while 
playing at Cooper City High School.

Silva played three years at Miami Springs High School before moving up to Connecticut for his final year. There he was named an all-league and All-New England performer.  

Strock has also begun to move around some of the personnel. Dane Ireson started last season as the strong-side linebacker. Now, Strock has shifted him over to defensive end. 

"Coaches will be watching the experiment closely," Strock said. "He's bulked up and his speed is a plus at that position."

"Regardless of how much we play the formation on defense, these practices will ultimately help the offense as well.This is a scheme they will be seeing from opponents throughout the season."

After the completion of the spring practice, FIU will begin summer workouts before starting fall practice in August.

The team is set to open up the year on Sept. 6 at Indiana State. The Golden Panthers play an even amount of six home and away contests with two being shown statewide on Sunshine Network.

Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The Florida International softball team won its sixth and seventh straight games as the Golden Panthers swept Florida Atlantic (2-1, 1-0) on Sunday afternoon in Boca Raton. FIU has now defeated FAU three times this season and has won four of its last six contests against the Owls.

FIU will open Sun Belt Conference play against New Mexico State Saturday and Sunday in Las Cruces.

GAME ONE

Marleah Stapf drove in two runs on a two-out double in the fourth inning to erase a one-run deficit and lift the Golden Panthers over the Owls, 2-1.

FIU pitchers Kendra Laminack and Nicole Barrett held FAU to four hits as Laminack (6-7) earned the win while Barrett picked up her seventh save of the season, setting a new school record for single-season and career saves.

The Owls got on the board in the third as Jennifer Cavanaugh scored from third on an Amy Bellisari ground ball to second.

FIU mounted a comeback in the top of the fourth when Jennifer Owens led off the inning with a single and advanced to second on an error.  Lindsay Tippings walked and Kristen Perry reached on a fielder's choice, moving Tippings to second. Stapf then hit her fifth double of the year, scoring Tippings and Perry.

Freel (10-7) had her 15th complete-game outing of the season.

GAME TWO

Amanda Nealer (13-6) tossed a one-hitter to give FIU a 1-0 victory over FAU. 

Nicole Dubovik brought Yarah Otero home on a single through the right side in the fifth inning for the games only run.

FIU hit safely seven times in the contest, but had difficulty bringing runners home as the Golden Panthers stranded five runners.

FAU's Pam Mazzarella (2-3) suffered the loss, allowing five hits in four and one-thirds innings of action. Candice Freel relieved Mazzarella in the fifth, allowing two hits and striking out two batters.

&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers won three of four games this week at home, including two out of three against conference foe Western Kentucky, to improve to 25-9 on the season.

FIU 5, Harvard 4

Senior third baseman Skip Adams hit a two-run double in the bottom of the eighth inning to give the Golden Panthers a 5-4 come-from-behind victory over the Harvard Crimson at University Park.

FIU overcame deficits twice in the contest starting in the second inning. Trailing 1-0, freshman outfielder Yahmed Yema singled home freshman James Bacon to knot the game at one apiece.

Bryan Pullin then hit a two-run double to the left field gap, and scored on an error in the third, giving FIU a 2-1 advantage.

The Crimson tied the game in the fourth, after back-to-back doubles by Brian Lentz and Trey Hendricks.

But FIU responded in the bottom of the inning. Adams (2-for-3, two RBI) singled to left-center, then stole second. Shortstop Luis Rivera (2-for-4, one RBI) followed with a run-scoring double to left center, knocking home Adams and putting the Golden Panthers ahead 3-2.

Harvard tied the score again in the sixth on an RBI single by Schuylez Mann, and took a 4-3 lead in the seventh on a Chris Mackey homerun.

But the Golden Panthers saved one last rally for the eighth. Freshman first baseman Bryan Pullin reached first on an error and advanced to second on a wild pitch. Center fielder Ricardo Nanita then walked, setting the stage for Adams, who drilled the ball into the left-center field gap, scoring both baserunners and giving FIU the home victory.

Junior Luis Gazitua pitched well for the Panthers, allowing four isolated runs in seven innings, while striking out seven. Senior Derek Taylor (4-0) got the win for FIU in relief.

FIU 10, 
Western Kentucky 9

Skip Adams provided more heroics, scoring the winning run in the bottom of the seventh to give FIU the 10-9 home victory over Western Kentucky.

The Golden Panthers had to come from behind four different times after a rocky outing by star pitcher Josh Banks, who allowed seven earned runs in six innings.

Luckily for Banks, the Golden Panther bats were on fire, putting together four multiple-run innings, the biggest coming in the deciding seventh inning.

Trailing 9-7, Bryan Pullin (2-for-4, two runs) led off the inning with a single to left field for FIU. Senior captain Adam Summerell (2-for-5, two RBI) then continued the rally with an RBI double, cutting the lead to 9-8. Ricardo Nanita was then hit by the pitch, and Adams singled to right-center. Junior Fernando Alvarez (1-for-4, two RBI) followed up with an RBI double to right-center, tying the game at nine.

With one out, Western Kentucky pitcher Matt Wilhite then threw a wild pitch, allowing Adams to score easily from third, giving FIU the lead for good.

Derek Taylor (5-0) pitched three innings of one-run ball in relief to earn the win for the Panthers.

Western Kentucky 11, 
FIU 7

Ace hurler Derek DeCarlo suffered his worst performance of the year, giving up seven runs in 4.2 innings, as the Golden Panthers fell to Western Kentucky 11-7 at University Park.

FIU jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the third inning, after RBI's by seniors Adam Summerell and Skip Adams, but couldn't hang on to it.
The Hilltoppers (14-9) exploded for two runs in the third and five more in the fifth, putting FIU behind 7-3.

However, Florida International made it interesting, putting together a four-run rally in the seventh. Freshman Brian Aragon got plunked and senior Michael New walked. 

Yahmed Yema kept things going with a single down the right field line. Luis Rivera then knocked home Aragon with a single to left, cutting the lead to three. 

Freshman Mike Lopez then drew a bases-loaded walk, cutting the deficit to 7-5. Adam Summerell and Fernando Alvarez then hit consecutive RBI fielder's choices to tie the game at seven.

But FIU would get no closer. Western Kentucky regained the lead, scoring four more runs in the last two innings off FIU's bullpen to put the Golden Panthers away for good.

Despite the poor performance, DeCarlo remained unbeaten as a Golden Panther. Junior Art Santos (0-5) took the loss for FIU.

FIU 10,
Western Kentucky 9

Luis Rivera went 5-for-6 with two runs, two doubles, and four RBI as Florida International edged the Hilltoppers at University Park.

The Golden Panthers jumped out to an early lead in the fourth inning, scoring eight runs on eight hits. 

Ricardo Nanita (1-for-5, two RBI) got the scoring started in the inning with a two-run homer, his team-leading sixth of the year. Skip Adams (2-for-5, 2 runs), Fernando Alvarez, and James Bacon all followed with singles. After Brian Aragon got hit by the pitch, Rivera doubled down the left-field line, scoring three, and putting FIU ahead 6-0. Bryan Pullin (2-for-4, RBI) continued the onslaught with an RBI double to left field, and Adam Summerell followed that with an RBI single of his own, giving the Golden Panthers a comfortable 8-0 lead after four.

The Hilltoppers' Matt Johnston (3-for-5, three RBI) homered in the fifth to cut the lead to 8-3. Western Kentucky added four more runs off of juniors Manuel Monreal and Luis Gazitua in the sixth, narrowing the gap to 8-7. 

The Hilltoppers then took a 9-8 advantage into the bottom of the eighth after a Matt Gunning two-run homer in the top of the inning.
However, Rivera was just getting started. Leading off the bottom of the eighth for FIU, Rivera doubled to deep right-center and advanced to third on a Pullin ground out. Summerell then struck out, but the pitch got away from Western Kentucky catcher Kevin Bearden, and Rivera raced home to tie the game at nine.

With the game knotted in the bottom ninth, Rivera still had one piece of unfinished business left. With the bases loaded and two outs, Rivera singled home Adams, giving FIU the 10-9 rubber match win in front of the jubilant home crowd.

DeCarlo named Sun Belt Conference Pitcher of the Week

Sophomore ace Derek DeCarlo was named Sun Belt Conference Pitcher of the Week for his performance the week of March 17. 

The Miami native (Miami Southridge High) went 2-0 during the week, striking out 15 batters, and setting a new FIU record for consecutive victories with 15, surpassing Willy Collazo. 

DeCarlo, a pre-season All-American who has yet to lose a game since joining FIU, was honored for his dominating wins over Stony Brook and Arkansas Little-Rock. 

DeCarlo stands at a perfect 4-0 on the season.

Up next for FIU

The Golden Panthers will take to the road to face Sun Belt Conference rival  Middle Tennessee April 4-6. 

The team returns to Florida to face Bethune-Cookman for a two-game set on April 9 and 10 and their cross-town rival the University of Miami. 
B-CC won two of the three games in a series at FIU in February. 
Ironically, both opponents were involved in altercations against FIU in their matchups earlier this season.

The Miami game is set for April 16 at University Park.

Last week, we mistakenly omitted Nicaise Parillon from the list of candidates in our recommendations. Parillon is running for president of the student government at the Biscayne Bay campus. 

We regret any confusion this might have caused. 

Parillon has spent over two years in student government. She was first Lower Division Representative and was then named Finance Chair. Parillon says she's running because she wants to serve the student body. 

"I am in it for the right reasons. I have three years in campus leadership," Parillon said. 

With her five-star program, Parillon plans to increase of class offerings, improve computer labs, establish a dental care plan for international students, create a student media outlet and improve overall customer service.

Headline: Killing of civilians unavoidable, inexcusable result of war
Author: Hsin-Nan Wu / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
Let me start this column with a bad joke.  

It goes like this: during the Crusade, a certain Christian general who was fed up with the futility of a siege decreed the order to start bombarding the town with cannons.  "But Sire," a Lieutenant approached and objected, "in addition to the Muslim infidels, there are also Jews and Christians in the town!" The general looked at the Lieutenant and then barked, "Well, let God sort them out!"

While such a joke may be crude, even to the point of being insensitive, today's war machine can create far more devastation than the crusading armies of the medieval times.

Just a few weeks ago, Pastor John gave us a talk about "Just War" and was saying that a war may be "just" if it fits all the definitions of the Catholic sage, St. Augustine.  

Well, dear ol' St. Augustine was a person of antiquity (a 4th century Christian who lived in Algeria and Italy) and even if he never saw the horrors of modern war and the total destruction that it unleashes, he still considered war a sin. 

Today's war is far more catastrophic than those of his time. 

Instead of two armies made up of volunteers who stood within proximity in a confined, two dimensional battleground, today's wars tend to involve weapons of massive firepower designed to overwhelm and annihilate the enemy from afar and from all angles so that the enemy will not stand the chance to fight back.  

Because of such weaponry, the possibility of innocent casualties increases exponentially.  Among those casualties there can be civilians who live too close to a military target or whose area is mistaken for a military target.  There can also be reluctantly drafted enemy soldiers willing to surrender when an opportunity presents itself.  Most unfortunately, there can even be our own boys and girls, who, in a case of an accident, are mistaken as enemy and are targeted in the so-called "fratricide" or "friendly fire" (which accounted for 24 to 31 percent of the total Killed-In-Action of the last Gulf War according to the last Pentagon report).  

As a Christian, one should be careful about major decisions such as the taking of other people's lives. Even if we are not Christian, our human conscience would still tell us that even one innocent life lost is one too many. 

Yet, the technology has made the launching of cruise missiles capable of tremendous damage easier than playing video games.  Each and every cruise missile that was fired into Baghdad recently for the military's "Shock & Awe" can create more destruction than a fully loaded 747.  

Yet, the military has used dozens, if not hundreds, of those on a city that still has a large civilian population. 

Should the loss of four thousand innocent lives in the Sept. 11 attack justify that?  Well, first of all, no concrete link has been established between Al Qaeda and the current Iraqi regime.  

The President, in his various speeches (including the "ultimatum" issued on March 17 and the "declaration of war" on March 19) has not mentioned such a link at all.  

Bear in mind that most of the hijackers were originally Saudi, and to confuse the Saudi with the Iraqis because of their similarity in ethnicity is as wrong as to confuse the Canadians with the Americans or the Koreans with the Cantonese. 

Even if it was indeed the current Iraqi regime that was behind the attack, justice is not served when we attack the civilian population.

Christians should also see it from the biblical viewpoint.  Would God approve of the tactic of mass bombardment that can level a city?  

Well, in the book of Genesis, God promised to refrain from destroying a whole city just because there could be at least 10 righteous men.  

We should note that the targeting of civilian population, however reprehensible, has been a common part of war. Even the righteous Allies during World War II (a war generally considered a "Just War") have targeted German populations with "Carpet Bombing" and the Japanese population with incendiary bombs (which killed more women and children than the more famous atomic bomb).  

Targeting the civilian population was an acceptable means of weakening enemy's morale (the resolve to fight the war).  In the eyes of the military, moral consideration is oftentimes a distant second to the no. 1 priority of "victory."  

Thus, the strategy of targeting civilians was only discontinued when the military found out that it tends to backfire and compounds the difficulty of the subsequent occupation. 

Nevertheless, the "accidental" deaths that are commonly called "collateral damage" are still a typical occurrence in modern warfare.  

For example, in the last Gulf War, the U.S. Air Force mistook Ameriyya air raid shelter as a potential enemy target and claimed some 200 to 300 civilian casualties (some Western human rights groups even estimate that 1.4 million Iraqi civilians lost their lives because of the war).  

In the Kosovo conflict, the Military mistook the Chinese Embassy as a target and fatal casualties were reported as well.  The point is, no matter how "smart" the weapon systems may become, they still cannot distinguish the innocent from the blameworthy. 

There is no bloodless war.  Thus, the only way of truly eliminating the risk of injuring an innocent man or woman (our side or theirs) is to practice abstinence from war.

One day, the Lieutenant in that bad joke shall meet his maker.  As the Lord ponders the judgment, He will gaze down and read out the names of the victims that the Lieutenant did or did not succor when he had the chance.

And it will be no defense to say: "I was just following orders."

Headline: Was that a bunker-buster or a blockbuster?
Subheadline: Gulf War II is no box office bomb
Author: Hans Castro / Staff columnist
&nbsp;
From the people who brought you "Korea" and "Vietnam" comes the "War on Iraq," a $100 billion-plus special effect extravaganza that plays as a sequel of sorts to the early '90s sleeper hit, "Gulf War."

Every now and then, a war comes along that reminds you of the unparalleled power of warfare, its sheer ability to blow people away. "War on Iraq" may not be such a war, but at least it aims to be, which is more than can be said for recent lackluster efforts like the under-achieving "Afghanistan."

The plot is simple enough: the American president (played almost convincingly by George W. Bush) teams up once again with his British Allies to bomb the heck out of Baghdad in order to take revenge on Saddam Hussein, the man who previously faced down Bush's father. 

There are some ponderous musings on love and death along the way, as well as some (mostly expected) plot twists involving oil, military bullying and some sneaky Frenchmen with an agenda all their own. Let's face it: this war, like any other war, is ultimately about watching rows after rows of people be mowed down by ever more impressive weaponry.  

And this is where we're given what we want. Neither of the governments spares any expense when it comes down to destruction: this is the spectacle that "Armageddon" wanted to be. The war delivers on the thrills and the chills, one-upping recent conflicts and aiming for the wide scope of classics like "World War I" and "World War II," but something gets lost along the way. 

Nonetheless, it is a valiant effort.

As the American president, George W. Bush is charmingly befuddled, except when he occasionally lapses into an obvious imitation of Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man." 

Tony Blair is dashing as a resolute Brit in a remarkable performance that is sure to raise some eyebrows in his homeland. He and Bush manage to create a lot of sexual tension as the ambiguous buddies, in a pairing that has more than one critic remembering "Lethal Weapon."

Unfortunately, the big let-down comes from Saddam Hussein as a prototypical villain. The Iraqi dictator played the role with vibrant panache in "Gulf War," but here he is simply not given enough to do until the very end, in a strained plot twist that can only described as "too little, too late."

There are some great supporting roles by peace protesters on one side and heroic soldiers on the other, as well as a brief but hilarious cameo by Michael Moore. 

Overall, "War on Iraq" is a flawed but intermittently riveting spectacle that will keep you on the edge most of the time (although it does hit some unforgivable dragging periods towards the mid-section). The plot holes are many but they seem to have an odd consistency of their own, and although it fails to tackle some more complex issues of warfare, who cares? If people wanted to think about war, they would read "War and Peace" or something. Those who expect a blockbuster with mind-blowing explosions and plenty of gore will be satisfied. 

Over all, I give this war three stars.

Headline: Shepard's lecture puts gay issues at forefront on campus, nation
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student, was brutally beaten Oct. 8, 1998. He would pass away four days later.  

The reason? He was gay.  

Since his death, Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, has crusaded for gay rights and against hate crimes in memory of her late son. 

Shepard hosted a lecture on Monday at FIU in hopes that her son's death will not be in vain.  

FIU is evidence that it won't.

FIU's Gamma Lambda Mu is one of a handful of gay fraternities across the nation.  

The organization seeks to provide a society where gay college men can participate in a Greek fraternal environment without fear of reprisal or rejection.   

In its brief life, it has already graced the pages of Time magazine for it's progressive step forward in the name of tolerance, an accomplishment all the more impressive in light of it's conservative-Hispanic Miami location. 

We hope that through the efforts of people like Judy Shepard, and organizations such as Gamma Lambda Mu, we will never have to turn on the television and relive this tragedy.

Headline: Universal Studios keeps Mardi Gras family oriented
Author: Felicidad Garcia, Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Mardi Gras seems to be the theme of choice these days; it has surfaced in the Miami-Dade County Youth Fair, countless homecomings and proms and the biggest Fat Tuesday facade of all: Universal Studios Mardi Gras. This is the eighth year in a row now that the Universal Orlando resort holds Mardi Gras in the Universal Studios theme park, and unlike Halloween Horror Nights, it does not plan on being moved over into Islands of Adventure, which does not have the necessary parade space.

Established by the French in the late 17th century, the Mardi Gras celebration was, like so many contagious diseases, introduced by European colonists to the new world, where New Orleans and its large French population became the local home for the celebration.  Universal Studios has made an obvious effort in attempting to recreate the feel of a New Orleans Mardi Gras experience, but with more of a family-friendly aspect.

Now, the only obvious problem with that is that isn't Mardi Gras as we know and love it. The park, though allowing beer and liquor, will have security all over the grounds that will quickly put any "trouble-makers" or exhibitionists in their place should they begin to show and tell.

Of course, there are some highlights to what feels like Mardi Gras with your parents. For starters, a visitor can be a costumed character in the parade, or even on a float, without having to dish out hundreds of dollars like you would in New Orleans to ride on a float. All you would need to do is sign up at the entrance to join in the parade, which starts at 8 p.m. After spending the day in the park, you can be suited up and given tons of beads to throw at eager pedestrians. 

Another added bonus of Universal Mardi Gras is a free concert series on Saturday nights, which began with Sugar Ray on Feb. 22 and will include some other well known artists such as Hootie & the Blowfish, Live, KC & the Sunshine Band and Counting Crows. It concludes on April 26, with Chris Isaak. The concerts are held in the area which is known as the Boneyard, where you might remember seeing a BeetleJuice or Wild, Wild West performances in the past.

I was lucky enough to attend the first Saturday of Mardi Gras, where Sugar Ray was the featured show. Mark McGrath and his band performed hit singles like, "Someday" and "Runaway" to a fairly large and predominantly youthful audience. Still, they also managed to throw in some more obscure songs like "Iron Mike" and "Under the Sun." Honestly, I was very much impressed by the entertainment provided by Sugar Ray that night. I mean, besides the repetitive hit singles showcased on the radio, I didn't know very much about this band and they had something for everyone. My interest was kept even when I didn't know the words to the songs (and it wasn't just because Mark is gorgeous, either). Mixing old-school hip-hop with modern alternative and a dash of reggae fusion, Sugar Ray creates a wonderfully eclectic, friendly atmosphere with the help of charismatic DJ Homicide. 

You know, what I noticed the most about the Mardi Gras at Universal was that I felt the essence of Mardi Gras not in the half-hour, 14 float parade, each of which took nearly a week to make, but in the concert audience.  I think a guest's main issue with this candy coated version of Mardi Gras with children and ultra-safe atmosphere is exactly that; it's not really like the drinking and debauchery of real Mardi Gras.

My advice, as an attendee of the first weekend of Universal Studios Mardi Gras, is that if you were already planning on going to Universal Studios, or if you have a yearly pass, then you might as well enjoy it while it lasts. Otherwise, don't actually go tremendously out of your way unless you really love one of the bands playing one weekend. Point being, don't go to this imitation-fragrance eau de Mardi Gras in order to get a cheaper feel for the one in New Orleans, because you're just going to end up getting a Calle Ocho with a very different set of spectators.

Headline: Linkin Park follows old formula for Meteora
Author: Robert J. Gramatges, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Linkin Park is back, as most may have heard, with their second album, Meteora, released last week to a long awaiting public. 

The band was under much pressure by fans and critics this past year and a half to release a follow-up to their astoundingly successful debut record Hybrid Theory, which went multi-platinum, becoming the number one selling album of 2001. 

Linkin Park had to be careful to avoid the sophomore stink that usually follows successful debut albums while constructing Meteora. The band focuses on improving their original recipe for success and they seem to have done so, creating a more melodious, multi-dimensional second album.      

Older, somewhat wiser and still yearning for acceptance, Linkin Park pleased its fans this year with the release of "Somewhere I Belong." 

Aside from some slight alterations, this first single off Meteora song follows protocol with the band's basic musical formula, a provocative hodge-podge of hard rock, electronic and hip-hop intertwined with child-like emotional lyrics sung with passion and vulnerability. 

Although the single is a good representation of Linkin Park's stance at this point, the album delves much more into their electronic side. 

Meteora featured producer Don Gilmore was at the helm as he was for Hybrid Theory, sharing production credits with the band. The 13-track album is short; a mere 36 minutes long, but packs a punch. 

The songs are multi layered and diverse ranging from Chester's rock-heavy vocal tracks ("Somewhere I Belong," "Faint," "Figure .09") to Mike Shinoda's more hip-hop/electronic influenced tracks ("Breaking the Habit," "Easier to Run") which break the rock barrier and speckle the album with more color. 

The stand out track of this album is definitely "Easier to Run." With lyrics Bennington produced during a free-writing exercise, the song's chorus is fresh and unique, with less screaming and a little bit of singing. Small electronic layers accentuate this song to add the Linkin park signature. 

The most innovative of the tracks is definitely "Nobody's Listening." The track is of oriental influence made a la Linkin Park. It showcases a very hip-hop beat with subtle guitars. Mike mans the verses while Chester puts his emotional cries into the chorus to make them his own. 

The album contains one instrumental track ("Sessions") created by Mike on the back of their bus using Pro Tools, the software the band used to write most of the album before going to the studio to do the actual recording. 

Meteora is no giant leap in terms of direction for the band, but it does bring them up a notch. It does not seem that time nor fame has healed the "wounds" they have sung about from last album to this one. 

Their lyrical content is still full of questions and hurt. Their words are nothing without the fervor of Chester's voice and the optimistic coolness of Mike's verses. 

The current that seems to push Linkin Park's music to land is their music's universality. The candor of their words allows large audiences to relate to their feelings without having to think about it. 

Linkin Park has continued to master the unrefined communication of raw emotion with this album, allowing fans to once again turn up the volume and scream away their problems with this new batch of songs.

Headline: Rock's jokes in Head of State rusted with stereotypes
Author: Jay Santiago, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's the same thing you've almost certainly seen at least a thousand times by now: an urban comedy that pokes fun at the government establishment. For the most part, "Head of State" works somewhat decently.  The problem arises when writer/director/actor turned political activist Chris Rock uses stereotypes to convey his jokes.  

Regrettably, they're the same, boring jokes he himself has used countless times. The effectiveness is further subdued by Rock, who tries to use humor to pass along political messages.  

"Head of State's" plot is simple enough; there are 12 weeks until the presidential election, and the democratic nominee has died, opening the door for someone to take his place and run against a George W. Bush-esque Republican. Enter Chris Rock who plays Mays Gilliam, a young up-and-coming activist trying to fix his deteriorating neighborhood.  

After he saves an old woman from an imploding building, Gilliam is thrown into the spotlight and  chosen as the man who will run for the democratic nomination, albeit for the wrong reasons. 

The movie goes off from there, with Gilliam, making speeches and eventually choosing his older brother Mitch (Bernie Mac) to be his running mate. 

It also features funny cameos by rappers such as Nate Dogg, who raps as the movie goes on.

"Head of State" relies too much on overused stereotypes that cause most jokes to fall flat. It's a shame for Rock, whose stand-up is some of the best, to have his name on a movie that does not do him justice. The jokes come off forced, with a few bright spots mostly courtesy of Mac.

Unfortunately, name recognition alone will probably equate to box office success as it did with "Down To Earth," his other attempt with movies.

Could this be the beginning of the end of Rock's quality acting career?

Headline: Second Calliope Fest paved way for women in music
Author: Krystal Alvarez, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Just when you thought Hollywood, Fla. had it all, there comes the Calliope Festival, the second annual music festival that honors up-and-coming women artists. Since the city's Community Redevelopment Agency formally announced March as "Women's Music Month," the Calliope Festival was in full swing.  On March 29-30, Young Circle Park was home to dozens of folk rock fans. 

These die-hard fans were very dedicated, enduring the hectic parking situation. Young Circle Park is small, but even smaller was the amount of parking spaces it had available for guests. I was forced to park across the street at a Walgreens parking lot. 

Once inside the park, there were rows filled with shopping huts. There was everything from discount clothes, to sunglasses, to Avon products.

 Anything silver, tie-dye or beaded was available for your shopping pleasure. There were also carnival-like stands selling overpriced food, drinks and cotton candy, as expected. 

As for seating? Well, I had to settle for bringing out my blanket and sitting under a large tree. I am used to either uncomfortable stadium seating or being crammed in between sweaty people at rock concerts, so this was a pleasant change. Perhaps the only people that got conned out of real seats were those overlooking the crowd, standing on tree branches. 

For the most part, the entire atmosphere was very relaxing. It really made me appreciate the natural environment.  I can now see why people like outdoor festivals.  

Still, even with its laid-back feel, I did feel a bit out of place, socially speaking. The festival crowd largely consisted of lesbian couples and I couldn't help but feel a little bit like an unwelcome outsider, especially not being familiar with much of the music or the fans. From my perspective, I can definitely say this event may not be for everyone.

However, for those who love the folk type music genre, the festival fulfills your every desire. I was lucky enough to hear the sounds of Diane Ward and Ani DiFranco. They were both outstanding and played very well live. DiFranco opened her set by stating her views on the war. She explained how we should support our country and not necessarily our government. 

This was certainly not the first nor the last anti-war demonstration at Calliope. I remember seeing two women wearing a white T-shirt saying, "F***k the War!" and another woman was wearing a flag as a cape, a peace shirt and army camouflage pants. 

The festival concluded Sunday night at 8:00 p.m. with a performance by Melissa Ferrick. In total, the concert showcased 20 female artists and opened doors to many unknown women musicians looking to establish a fan-base. 

The festival certainly completed its task of celebrating women in music and will hopefully do so next year hopefully after fixing some minor glitches (like parking).

 Although Calliope is an acquired taste, it is not an experience I will soon forget. It is also worth checking out some songs by Ani DiFranco or any of the artists showcased at Calliope Fest to see if you like women's folk rock. If you discover you like it, then Calliope is definitely a festival you should check out.

Headline: Museum showcases talents of MFA graduates
Author: Isis Iglesias, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There was a throng of people waiting to enter the Art Museum on Monday night. Friends, family, faculty and students gathered to view the artwork by the MFA graduates. There was a large turnout for the talented new artists. 

The exhibit features the artwork of Judith Blumenthal, Julie Lopez, Mauricio A. Ramirez, Barbara Rivera, Gretchen Scharnagl and upcoming spring 2003 graduate, Lynne Rheam. 

The MFA program is in its third year at FIU.  "We are pleased to introduce yet another wonderful group of young, talented artists to the community," said Carol Foster, associate director of The Art Museum at FIU.

It's a small class of dedicated artist that have put in a lot of hard work in their craft. The pieces are extremely engaging. The exhibit includes installations, photographs, paintings and other mixed media. Those who attended the opening seemed entranced by the work. The art was visceral and thought-provoking, modern and edgy, but still captivating. 

Judith Blumenthal's untitled work is a real attention-grabber. Sleepy students beware, you might be tempted to pull back the plastic blankets encasing the bed and crawl into the black and white sheets. Both of her installations are about the basic biological needs of humans, things like food, water, air and rest. 

Blumenthal's work is about the fact that typical people take the satisfaction of these needs for granted.  The artist's work reflects her worries over the state of the world. "Our current political situation calls into question whether these basic needs are threatened and if so, how will humans adjust?" said Blumenthal.  

Julie Lopez's mixed media piece is a beautiful explosion of art on the wall. Every integral part is in itself perfect. As a whole, it soars before the eyes. The large piece consists mainly of black and white animal images and abstractions; tiny drawings and paintings of birds, dogs and people. There is so much to see in the work that it takes a while to digest it all. 

Just for fun, see if you can find the cigarette butt the artist decided to include in the piece. Lopez herself commented, "My mixed media drawings contain a language of symbols that represent my landscape, my home and my life." 

"These symbols are based on the strong characteristics of the area around my home such as the numerous packs of stray dogs, the power lines that merge with the sky, the turkey buzzards that lasso the clouds and the land crabs that jog the roads. My drawings, paintings, ceramics and films are my homage to South Dade," she added.

Across the wall, on a television screen, flicker the images that are  Lopez's second work in the exhibit. Thumping music plays along with images that depict the creative impulses that go into making art. The video installation is aptly titled "Drawing Ritual" and is an illuminating addition to Lopez's already interesting work.

A native of Colombia, Mauricio A. Ramirez was inspired by photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo to photograph the children playing on its streets. His photographs titled "Children of Colombia" reveal vibrant soft colors taken in surprisingly harsh light. He accurately portrays the magical moments when children are lost in play and unaware of anything else.

In a more traditional art form, there are two large paintings by Barbara Rivera in the exhibit. She says of her work, "My paintings portray female narratives of becoming and of transformation. The paintings are 'fantastic' in that they imply an escape from reality into other possibilities." Her work is representational and depicts the female form floating against a cool blue backdrop. 

Various floating bodies stretch across the canvas, clad in white cotton slips, skin gleaming against folds of fabric.  As ethereal as the figures are, they also hold a strange dramatic tension.

Gretchen Scharnagl's art installation "Clay Pigeons" inhabits a dark space.  The shapes of rock-like birds litter the floor and overhead flickers the flying forms of the fowl on a video screen. Included in the installation is a 2,000 page book filled with quotes, facts and literature on the birds. 

The dim lighting makes one want to sit down on the floor with the pigeons and read the book which the museum-goer is invited to touch. The only thing that was missing was the cooing of the pigeons. 

 Lynne Rheam's Route photographs have a haunting realism. The images are filled with what the naked eye really sees. The light becomes a character. Her landscapes are filled with man-made elements: crumbling hotels, porch framed houses and meditative buildings. 

Her photographs also portray  the tenuous relationship with people and nature. All of the landscapes look abandoned and are filled with the essence of the humans that once inhabited those spaces. Her work takes you to places that don't seem to exist anywhere but in the mind of the artist. Rheam's technical ability is obvious and she shows enough heart to give the work profound meaning. When asked about her plans after graduation Rheam said simply, "I'm going to clean my house."   

One of the more whimsical elements of the show is a standing bubble gum machine with a small sign that reads:  Art for 25 cents. This was a collaborative effort of the students and is filled with multi-colored eggs each with a piece of do-it-yourself art inside. 

The MFA show is only going to be exhibited at the museum through Wednesday, April 9. Don't miss this exciting show. 

Additionally, these art stars of tomorrow will be talking about their works at the next Wednesdays After Hours. This program will be given at the Art Museum at FIU on April 2 at 6:30 p.m. For more information call (305) 348-8762

Headline: The Contradictions of this War
Subheadline:  
Author: os21@aol.com
&nbsp;
This war, I hope, is just a bad dream. Our country, once the emblem of freedom throughout the world, has now become the antithesis of that concept. Not only are our enemies scared to death of us, but so are our allies. The current White House administration has taken our nation over the top and into the pits of fire, all in the name of freedom and liberty:

As we "liberate" Iraq, I wonder if any Iraqi civilians will be able to take part in that liberation after the war is over, as U.S. and British bombs continue to decimate civilians in an attempt to free them from their oppression. 

At last count, "coalition" forces have killed over 700 Iraqi civilians.

President George W. Bush has sent in our troops to fight this war, and as soon as they have left the House of Representatives passed a bill that would cut $25 billion over the next ten year's from veteran's health care and benefits programs.

Our president asserts that Iraq has defied the United Nations for too long and must be "disarmed," while our country has gone against the UN Charter and declared an illegal war against Iraq in defiance of the UN Security Council.

Osama bin Laden has still not been captured.

The Middle East and its people continue to loathe our country, as the breeding grounds for terrorist organizations are receiving more and more applicants to carry out attacks against U.S. interests and institutions. 

Most nations of the world and their citizens are against this war, even the populations of "coalition" countries such as Britain and Spain, where over 80% of their people are against the war.

65% of Americans cannot find Iraq on a map.

I hope Iraq does not look anything like Afghanistan after this war is over. Did you forget already? Afghanistan is the other country we "liberated," where more innocent civilians died during the U.S. campaign there than died on September 11. I assume that justifies everything.

North Korea has nuclear weapons, Iraq never did.

Hamas, the now famous Palestinian terrorist organization, has never as much as spit in the direction of America, yet it is on top of the list of terrorist organizations the U.S. is set to take out. Why? Ask Israel.

Our country is not making any friends in the Middle East with this war, but is only exacerbating the rifts. All for the sake of one small "ally" who receives over $4 billion in aid a year from the U.S.

Contradictions are in abundance as this war takes place. The moral high ground our country sat on after September 11 has been swept away, and now it is we, not the evil terrorists, who the world fears.

Hello,
Recently I attended the Board of Trustees meeting specifically the one on March 12, 2003.
I need to write a report on the meeting and am looking for information. I was wondering if any members from the beacon attended this meeting and reported on it. or if there were any pictures taken of the meeting. 
thank for your time I would appreciate any help.
Isvett
