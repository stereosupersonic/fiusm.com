As an FIU graduate and current FIU employee and graduate student I am 
appauled that a member of the FIU community would commit such an act, let 
alone an FIU police officer. I lived for 4 years on FIU's University Park Campus 
and relied on the FIU police to keep me safe. One of the highlights of FIU was 
that there were Florida State police officers on campus 24/7. I no longer feel 
safe. I, myself, feel violated by what has happened. Does it matter that the girl 
was not an FIU student or employee? I do not believe it makes any difference. It 
was still one of FIU's officers, and not only that, but he was on duty at the time. 
Officer Currie was supposed to be protecting FIU's campus the event transpired.
 I no longer feel I can trust and confide in FIU's police officers. I believe FIU 
students have a right to know what this police officer looks like, so they are fully 
aware of what is walking around our campus. If alledged sex offenders have 
their faces plastered in the newspaper and on the Miami Dade Government 
website, so should Officer Currie. Students need to stand up for their rights and 
their safety. If students were to speak up and make their voices heard, I'm sure 
an act, such as the one in which Officer Currie is accused, would not occur 
again. 
FIU is a university, a place of higher learning, not a place to be feared.

FULL PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Florida International University dismisses two excellent employees for publishing a book!

On March 7, 2005 Concepcion L. Tuma and Dulce M. Ramirez-Damon were released of their duties from Florida International University, from their positions as Career Consultant and Assistant Director of Career Services respectively.  The Senior Director, Olga Magnusen, began her retaliatory efforts upon publication of their book, Building a Lemonade Stand is Not Just for Kids Anymore, in November 2004. While the Senior Director, Olga Magnusen,  stated that it was a no cause dismissal and added that both could apply to other FIU positions, both Concepcion and Dulce know their termination is Olga Magnusen's way of retaliating since the book was not her idea. They state: "The quality of our work is unquestionable, our evaluations are excellent, our commendations from faculty, students, staff, co-workers and employers are exceptional.  We spent our time in the office collaborating on new projects and events to provide additional networking opportunities for FIU's  33,000+ students.  We just worked for someone who rejects new ideas and then allows them to resurface months down the line with her name on it.  Had the book been Olga Magnusen's idea, we would still be employed"

The dismissal follows the publication of the book Building a Lemonade Stand is Not Just for Kids Anymore.  The book was awarded Editor's Choice by iUniverse Publishing and their achievements have been recognized by an article in FIU's College of Business publication Business Networks, FIU Magazine, a book review in the Journal of College Teaching and Learning and have been included in Miami Dade College's ad campaign "Call us Essential, Call us the College." Tuma and Damon concur, "The Senior Director, Olga Magnusen, wanted to be the one to be recognized ALL of the time.  The fact, that we were at the forefront getting the attention drove her nuts."

President Modesto Maidique took time out of his busy schedule and wrote a letter thanking them for providing him with a copy of the book.  "I enjoyed perusing through the book over the winter break."  He added,  "I have placed the book in my office where my guests may also enjoy the opportunity to read your book."  

While the Senior Director, Olga Magnusen, continuously ignored their accomplishments, reprimanded them for submitting proposals to national conferences, and belittled their successes in staff meetings; they were asked to be guest speakers during class lectures, they were asked to give presentations at national conferences and were recently invited to the naming ceremony of the Entrepreneurial Center, which was attended by the Mayor Carlos Alvarez, Governor Jeb Bush along with other political figures and large donors of FIU. 

Throughout their tenure at Florida International University they have been recognized for excellent work, commitment, and customer service.  Donna Lee, Assistant Director at BBC, nominated them for the 2005 Employee Recognition Award.  Furthermore, university-wide e-mails were sent congratulating the publication of the book; yet the Senior Director created new policies and procedures to inhibit, intimidate and discourage their peers from applauding their endeavors.  The Senior Director, Olga Magnusen, went as far as refusing to pay for national conferences where they were representing the university discussing the topic of entrepreneurship.  She sabotaged potential presentations and prohibited any conversation regarding the book.  All because, Concepcion and Dulce thought of it first!  And, isn't that what entrepreneurs do?  Anticipate the need, research their idea and implement! 

Florida International University is a Kauffman Campus that received over $ 3 million to establish entrepreneurial programs and the two were dismissed for fulfilling the mission and vision of the University as stated in the President's Millennium Plan. 

·	Their entrepreneurial spirit was punished and
·	The entrepreneurial spirit the Kauffman Foundation promotes and gave $3 million to, in order to further the institutionalization of entrepreneurship, is EXTINGUISHED!

Headline: Livestrong bracelet overshadows cyclist
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Here we are in the middle of the Tour de France. Lance Armstrong - in the final tour of his career - is well on his way to an unprecedented seventh tour victory and still not too many people care.

I find this extremely ironic considering his Livestrong bracelet is worn by practically everybody on campus. It's a shame that a bracelet that was supposed to stand for something meaningful has become a mere fashion statement.

Want proof? Look at all the Livestrong bracelet spin-offs that have emerged. There is a bracelet to support almost any cause - from breast cancer to Miller beer to Satanic worship. 

Now don't get me wrong, most of these bracelets support great causes. In fact, I'm guilty of owning a couple myself - but the hot commodity is the yellow Livestrong bracelet and what is sad, is that most people who want it wouldn't know Lance Armstrong, even if he walked into the same room as them. 

They also wouldn't know about his record six - soon to be seven - consecutive Tour de France wins. Something nobody thought was possible, much less by an American. 

What is truly terrible is that some of these people don't know the true story of Lance Armstrong: Being told he had testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs, while he was seemingly at the top of his game. 

Armstrong's own web site says that if his story were "scripted by Hollywood, the story would be dismissed as a trite melodrama."
He had less than a 50/50 chance for survival and, not only did he overcome it, he returned to cycling and won the biggest race of his profession six consecutive times.

That movie wouldn't even be considered a melodrama, it would be science fiction.

Yet, there are some people who aren't aware of this. 

I saw a girl in class wearing the little yellow bracelet and I asked her if she knew who Lance Armstrong was.

Her reply: "Oh, you mean that saxophone player?" 

Then you wonder why I'm so cynical when it comes to those bracelets. 
Despite people's ignorance, those bracelets have raised millions of dollars for cancer research. With their unexpected popularity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation greatly surpassed their fund-raising goal.

So maybe those bracelets aren't that bad because, for once, people's ignorance is helping others rather than keeping them down.

All I want is a bit more respect for this man. You may think he gets enough respect, but he still deserves more. He battled cancer and has won races that mainly consist of cycling up the steep French Alps. Most of us can't cycle up a slight incline without rolling backwards.

Lance Armstong is an amazing athlete, but more importantly an amazing person.

He is the one that should be recognized for that and not some yellow wristband.

So the next time I see a random person with that bracelet on, I'll ask her if she knows who Lance Armstrong is. Hopefully she won't say, "He's the guy who made this bracelet."

Headline: Former soccer captain dicusses life in MLS
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Bobby Boswell, a former defender and co-captain for the FIU men's soccer team, says he has been fascinated by soccer since the age of five and that it's a passion he's been following all his life.

That commitment to the sport recently paid off for the university graduate when he joined Major League Soccer with  Cup champion D.C. United in March. Since then, Boswell has been playing central defender, starting 13 games this season and playing more minutes than anyone else on the team. 

The 2004 NSCAA/Adidas All-South First Team pick recently took time from his traveling to talk with The Beacon about his FIU memories, time on the road and soccer in general.

Q: How did you start playing for D.C. United?
They invited me into a camp they were having here in Florida and, after I was with them, they asked me to play for them a little more. Eventually, they offered me a contract.

Q: What do you remember the most about playing at FIU?
I remember the weather was nice, both the practice and my teammates were a lot of fun and how we joked around with the coach all the time. The games were the best, especially when we won the big tournaments.

Q: As a player for a professional soccer team, you've probably traveled around the country. What's the wildest city you've been to?
Well, we get to the city the day before the game and then leave either the night of the game or early the next morning - they try to keep us from doing something wild.

We were in Honolulu for eight days once and that was a lot of fun. We got to hang out on the beach. The weather was perfect and we won the game against Los Angeles, so it was all great. I'd never been to Hawaii, so it was a great experience.

Q: How do you feel about the lack of enthusiasm for soccer here in the US when compared to the hype given to other sports?
I think there is support, and it maybe isn't as large as other sports, but the people who do support it are loyal. They're die-hard fans, and that speaks a lot. I think it's growing, and the sport of soccer is growing in America and we're being recognized around the world.

Q: Do people you don't know recognize you on the street, and if so, how do you deal with fans?
Occasionally, you get a fan or two who knows who you are, who comes and asks 'Don't you play for D.C. United?' But it's nothing out of the ordinary, since it happens less than more. I mean, I get a few people who tell me they know what I do, but mostly, no, nothing much.

Q: If you could play for any team beside D.C. United, what team would it be and why?
I would probably play for Ajax in Holland, because that's the team I supported growing up.

Q: Who do you think was or is the greatest soccer player of all time?
That's hard to say because there are a lot of players on the field with different roles. [Argentine soccer player Diego] Maradona would probably be on the top of my list because he played as a midfielder and he was the whole package.

Q: Who do you think is going to win the next World Cup?
Right now, I'm gonna go with Brazil. They're playing really well. They have so much talent [that] I don't think they can be beat.

Headline: Heat have right pieces to win, need minor adjustments
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Much can happen in one year. During the 2002-2003 season, the Miami Heat had one of the worst records in the Eastern Conference and seemed to be headed in the wrong direction.

Just one year later, the up and coming play of  athletes spectacular Dwayne Wade and Lamar Odum pushed the team  through the first round of the playoffs before getting beat by one of the best teams in the league - the Indiana Pacers.

Just one year after that, Miami was were one broken rib and a bruised thigh away from winning it all.

This off-season, the Heat have a task they have never had in their franchise history - strictly maintaining the same pieces that got us all the success from last season and plug in a few entities that can get us over the hump.

This year was one of the few years the draft didn't mean as much to the Heat. They wanted to get an experienced player that has the tools to be consistent and contribute right away.

They couldn't have done a better job than getting Wayne Simien. The four-year player out of Kansas averaged 15 points, 8 rebounds and shot .56 percent from the field throughout his collegiate tenure.

During his senior year, he lead the Big 12 in scoring and rebounding and was the only player to average a double-double.	

You can lock up the team's other power forward as well because Miami native Udonis Haslem - despite being aggressively pursued by the Cleveland Cavaliers - wanted to be a part of the Miami Heat so badly that he agreed to the maximum contract the Heat can give him, $34 million over five years. He took $10 million less than what Cleveland had offerrd.

During this past season, there was also a lot of talk about the Heat involving Eddie Jones in a trade, but after his magnificent play in the playoffs, Heat President Pat Riley has silenced all those remarks by saying, "there is no way we would move [Eddie], he is a valuable part of this franchise and a big reason for our success so far."

A few of our key reserves are also guaranteed for the 2005-2006 season. Those include talented small forward Rasual Butler and key backup center Michael Doleac.

But two reserves the Heat are really excited about are two that weren't even active throughout most of the season. Youngsters Qyntel Woods and Dorrell Wright are currently playing in the Heat's summer league and are sure to add a lot of energy and talent to the bench.

No player can sign a contract until July 22. All they can do is agree in principle.

That's basically what star center Shaquille O'Neal has done, with the Heat likely offering him a five-year contract that will keep him as the highest paid player in the league.

However, there are two key questions marking this offseason:  Whether Damon Jones and Keyon Dooling will come back. Recently, they opted out of their contracts and chose to be free agents, but the Heat's front office is pretty positive they can get them both back or at least one.

In addition, the Heat have picked up the option on Miami favorite Alonzo Mourning. Now all it comes down to is whether or not Zo will be healthy enough to play.

In an interview on "The Paul and Young Ron Show," Zo stated that his doctors have cleared him to play and said, "There's a 75 percent chance I will come back and play basketball."

So far, there seems to be a pretty good chance that last years Heat team will look a lot like this year's. But a few players will be different and there could be some good players out there that can improve the team.

The Heat recently signed  former University of Florida player Matt Walsh to play point guard. The six foot six inch junior finished off averaging 15 points, 4 rebounds and shot 45 percent from the field.

He may be one in a long list of point guards the Heat sign if by chance they don't get Jones or Dooling back.

If they can't get those two back, they may want to look to an experienced guard that can run the offense well and does not need the ball in his hands to be effective.

Boston Celtics free agent Gary Payton seems to be an enticing offer. After struggling in Phil Jackson's triangle offense, the glove was shipped to Boston where he had a very successful year.

I believe he can be a catalyst on this Heat lineup that already has the firepower of Shaq and Wade.

We wouldn't need him to score a lot or put up big numbers, but his experience will surely not have him score two points and turn the ball over countless amounts of times in a Game 7. (I don't want to mention any names, Damon, but you should be lucky the Heat are still pursuing you after that).

One type of player that the two teams in the NBA Finals had was a power forward that can stretch the defense with their long range shooting.  

The Pistons had Rasheed Wallace and the Spurs had Robert Horry. The Heat hope they can get that with Clifford Robinson.

Coming out of the Golden State Warriors, where he averaged eight points and three rebounds, Robinson would bring a lot of experience and success from beyond the arc that could be vital deep into the playoffs.

The Miami Heat and its fans have a lot to look forward to this season. Wade just keeps getting better and now the Heat have that notch of playoff experience under their belt to carry themselves to the next level.

If everything falls into place,  this will be another great season of basketball under that South Florida sun. Hopefully, it won't consist of a bruised thigh or a sore rib.

Headline: Anti-viral drugs bring hope to AIDS forefront
Author: German Silverio / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It had been a while since I last heard about AIDS, and even though I have not forgotten it, for me it was pretty much old news. 

It's not that I wasn't aware of STDs and the threat they pose to our lives, especially to our age group. Rather, I no longer thought of AIDS so much as a big public issue, but as a private one. 

AIDS affects nearly 40 million people around the world and, given our inability to effectively combat it, six- million people are expected to die from it within the next two years, according to the International Aids Society.

Culturally, AIDS used to be associated with homosexuality and Africa. Now that we have dispelled the exclusiveness of AIDS with regards to homosexuality, considering the soaring infection rates among young crystal-meth users, we are left with Africa, a continent we consider too distant to care much for. 

I regained my social awareness of AIDS after reading an article on the Biscayne Bay Campus website titled "Buying Time to Fight AIDS," by Barnaby Phillips. 

It wasn't an article bent on depressing the hell out of the reader, impressing him with statistics, or worse, giving the indifferent reader a guilt trip - for that I am grateful. 

It was simply an article that took a step past the sadness of the disease and dove into the joy of a South African woman named Prudence Radebe. 

Radebe had been given free retro-antiviral drugs, which are meant to slow down the effects of AIDS and to counter the malady. 

About a year ago, Phillips states Radebe weighed less than 62 pounds and was so weak, she had resigned to her death. 

Now, a year later, she weighs around 132 pounds. Her life, and that of her son, have high prospects. Radebe was given a second shot at life.

Phillips compares the case of Radebe to that of some of her neighbors, who weren't able to get the retro-antiviral drugs, and comments on how these drugs have made a world of difference in her life.

In the United States, we have more extensive means to counter AIDS; help is as near and as convenient as going to FIU's Wellness Center every Monday. 

There is free HIV testing available to students and a non-profit organization, Care Resource, comes to provide students with information as to where and how to get help for this disease. 

In the case of Radebe, it's hard to read a story such as hers and not be moved. 

For me, it really wasn't about compassion, and much less pity. I was earnestly glad to hear good news from people whose lives, at a point, seemed to have been permanently lost. 

The horrible tales we so often hear about AIDS are meant to strike fear in us, while the tale of Radebe does the contrary: It inspires hope. 

AIDS is not a lost cause and I am glad that it is not thought of as such by the 300,000 Africans receiving anti-viral drugs. 

"We do a lot of AIDS stories in this part of the world but not many like this ... with a happy ending," Phillips said. I would be glad if he just kept them coming.

Headline: FIU's safety in question after campus officer  is placed on administrative leave, following an alleged sexual assault on an 18-year-old woman
Subheadline: EDITORIAL
Author: Harry Coleman and Leoncio Alvarez / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Ever since early childhood, students are taught the differences between what is right and wrong. By the time students reach a collegiate level, they should have prospered enough as individual thinkers and be able to clarify the difference between right and wrong with their own common sense. Isn't it only fair that those who are hired to protect and watch over us share the same kind of mentality? Common sense would agree.

A campus police officer with a history of domestic battery and child abuse has been fired, rehired and arrested three times while on duty at our university. Now that's a noteworthy caretaker.

With a history of criminal allegations, one would think that the university would have noticed some kind of a problem with 35-year-old Frederick Currie. Even though all charges were dropped for the domestic battery accusations and Currie was acquitted of a felony of child abuse charge, should the campus community really have a policeman of these standards patrolling its campuses?

Even though one is innocent until proven guilty, a history of allegations should suggest that this man might have psychological problems and should seek counseling before taking a position as a public safety officer. According to an official copy of Currie's personnel file, he threatened his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend by telling him that he would kill him, his ex-girlfriend and himself if the new boyfriend didn't stay away from his ex-girlfriend. 

Just because he has a police badge and a gun does not mean that he can threaten to kill someone and get away with it. If there is a connection between Currie and the alleged sexual assault on the 18-year-old woman, this would be a disgrace to the university and the community. Having a cop who abuses his power is unacceptable. 

Someone with Currie's history should not be hired to protect the community, much less a university with tens of thousands of young people.

Headline: President cheers on Schiavo, Iraqi war and protests. stem cell research
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you're a republican, you had to be in good spirits when the Spring semester ended. With complete control of the presidency and Congress, you had to feel good about your agenda, not to mention your prospects for growing your majority in the 2006 midterm elections. What a difference a few months make. You have to admit that when a country elects a former male college cheerleader with a C average as president, your politics have to have some absurdity.

The latest AP-Ipsos poll found that President Bush's approval rating is at 43 percent, while Congress checks in at an astonishingly low 31 percent, the lowest marks for either since the poll began in December 2003. Only 35 percent of adults believe the country is heading in the right direction and 41 percent support Bush's handling of the Iraqi war. 

These historically low numbers come only seven months after Bush's reelection, in which he claimed to have earned "political capital" to advance his conservative agenda. With Congress and the media in his pocket, no one thought to suggest he would have any trouble.  Now the question is, what happened?

Bush found himself in a situation that only he could have bungled. First he pushed for the privatization of Social Security, arguing that making the program susceptible to the market, instead of a guaranteed benefit, was to the advantage of America's youth. That position fell flat on its face with Americans, although Bush seems to think that by repeating the same mantra day in and day out Americans will one day wake up and see it his way.  

Dear President Bush, 

Just because you misled us into a war once, does not mean we'll fall for your shenanigans again.  Like you said in Tennessee back a few years ago, "Fool me once, shame on you ... fool me twice ... shame on, uh ... you can't get fooled again."

	-Forward Thinking Americans

DEAD OR ALIVE

The next craze came in the form of Terri Schiavo. Diverting from traditional conservative thought, republicans attempted to interfere in a private matter to keep the brain damaged woman alive, even if her husband and legal guardian insisted she did not want to be kept alive in such a manner. Although over 60 percent of Americans sided with the husband, Michael Schiavo, the radical conservatives (Radcons) backed their narrow interests, the Christian Right, over the sentiment of most Americans. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., didn't help matters when he admitted a memo claiming that the Schiavo case would be a "great political issue" originated in his office. 

This case is still coming up in the news, and yet I could have sworn that they took Mrs. Schiavo off life support and that Michael Schiavo won the legal battle. What a crazy world we live in.

DON'T TOUCH MY FILIBUSTER, BUSTER!

A recent conservative blunder was the Republicans attack on the federal judiciary.  In blatant attempts to load federal benches with conservative "activist" judges, radical Republicans in the Senate tried to revoke the minority's right to filibuster judicial nominees. 

Led by majority leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., these senators wanted to eliminate the minority's last instrument to have a voice in the U.S. Senate.  

Without the filibuster, Republicans would have been free to put anyone on federal benches, qualifications be damned.  

Fortunately, some sensible moderate Republicans such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., came together with seven Democrats to forge a compromise to ensure the filibuster was maintained. They understood its importance and acknowledged that one day Republicans will be the minority again and they themselves will benefit from the filibuster.

MAKE LOVE NOT WAR

Finally, the most consistent topic of bad news is the Iraqi war.  Everyday Americans hear about more troops dying in Iraq along with more allegations of prisoner abuse. With the Bush administration's reasoning for the war proven false, Americans can only ask, "Why?"  Hence the low approval numbers for the Bush campaign.

Considering the Bush administration lost, or is losing on all the aforementioned issues, it is safe to say the ''political capital'' is long gone. Democrats, Republicans and independents are more aware of the Bush administration succumbing to the interests of the Christian Right. 

The vast majority of the population is opposed to these developments and is clearly voicing its dissent. It is no wonder Bush is threatening to veto legislation Congress is sure to pass that opens stem cell research to more federal funding. 

The Republicans in congress are separating themselves from the White House, knowing midterm elections are around the corner, while Bush continues to oppose the legislation that could help millions with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and spinal cord injuries because Christian fundamentalists oppose it.

The consequences of these developments remain to be seen. What is clear is that Democrats have a precious opportunity to gain seats in both the House and the Senate in 2006, not to mention a chance to regain the governor's mansion in Florida. 

If history is any indication, we can assume Bush won't be changing his hardline approach anytime soon. The issue is then, who will Democrats nominate to run in these races?  In Florida, the party is off to a good start on that front.

Author: Damian Grass / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
FIU was announced as one of the nation's top 20 universities to grant degrees to Blacks and other minorities, according to a leading magazine which focuses on the higher education of Black communities.

Black Issues in Higher Education's Top 100 list ranks FIU as the third university in the country awarding the most baccalaureate degrees to minorities, behind the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of California-Berkeley. 

The magazine also ranks FIU number one in the country in granting Hispanics with baccalaureate degrees in business, education and health professions. 

FIU alumna Keisha Talbot, who graduated in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in business administration, said she had the option of going to Howard University, but decided to remain closer to her family, which lives in Orlando.

"Coming to FIU exposed me to other cultures," said Talbot. "New and diverse experiences are as important in an education as the courses you take."

Headline: After various delays, fitness center to open in August
Author: Damian Grass / Asst. News Editor
&nbsp;
FIU officials involved in the development of the new Recreation Center at the University Park campus are waiting for the final inspection from the state fire marshall before opening its doors.

Since its ground-breaking ceremony in October 2003, the grand opening of the new gym has twice been delayed - it was originally scheduled to open in Fall of 2004 and then in April of this year.

"Despite a few more hurdles, we're very excited and anticipating for an early open in August," said Rob Frye, director of recreation services.
The new 50,000 square-foot gym is located just west of the Health and Wellness Center, in Parking Lot Eight, and is within walking distance from the Pharmed Arena. 

Staying within the initial budget of $8.9 million, the Recreation Center will house 12,500 square feet of fitness rooms for cardio, free weights and resistance machines, two 3000 square-foot rooms at 3,000 square-feet for aerobic classes and two full-size men's and women's locker rooms with 220 lockers in each.   

"I'm happy to announce that we have not exceeded the budget," said Jim Wassenaar, director of housing, "But [we're] not too thrilled that we have exceeded the time to get it built."

Basketball and volleyball enthusiasts will no longer fall victims to South Florida's unexpected weather when playing at the facility's two indoor courts.

Visitors will be greeted by a walk-up information and membership window, a pro-shop that will sell health drinks, snacks and athletic gear, plus a food service area. The vendor is yet to be determined.

The new gym will also have an enclosed "Fitness Outpost" area that wasn't included in the original plans. 

Complete with a variety of treadmills, bikes and upper body ergometers that measure the amount of work done by a muscle or group of muscles, the 2,000 square foot space was designed for exercisers seeking a more private workout.

Four specialized machines will be moved into the private area to accommodate people with disabilities. Aside from that, the Recreation Center will be stocked with all new state of the art workout equipment and top-brand televisions, which hang from ceilings and walls throughout the gym.

With only nine full-time professionals at the fitness center ready to move into their new work environment, job applicants are wanted in order to expand its staff.

"We always hire a number of students each semester for a variety of jobs, including fitness attendants, trainers and referees," Frye said.

Membership fees, which are categorized in blue (basic) and gold (premium), are available for faculty, staff and affiliate members. Gold membership includes locker rental, towel service, free group fitness classes and a free consultation with a personal trainer. All FIU students receive basic membership privileges.

Students who frequent the fitness center are looking forward to a new change in their workout routine.

"The current gym is cool, but I heard that the new gym is going to be awesome," said senior Carlos Benitez.

Leticia Johnson, whose majoring in business and lives in student housing, finds the longer hours a matter of convenience for students with busy schedules and likes what she sees.

"I walk by the new gym every morning on my way to the fitness center and I can see how nice it looks inside," Johnson said. "I just can't wait."

Headline: Linton predicts improvements
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
After taking over as the vice president of the Student Government Association at the Biscayne Bay Campus in April, Lemar Linton has expressed his excitement to begin his goals for an improvement at BBC. 
His first priorities include filling four out of the six open positions at SGA, improving customer service and stopping tuition increases.

Q: What were your feelings when they announced you had won the SGA elections? 
On one hand I was very, very happy and proud that the hard work on my campaign had paid off. On the other hand, I felt gratitude toward all those students who voted for me. 

Q: What is your major and do you feel that it has helped you during your campaign? 
My majors are accounting and international business. My international business background specifically aided me in my campaign. The courses that I have taken have sharpened and fostered my communication and interaction skills. 

Q: Which positions are still open here at the SGA-BBC? 
To date we only have about four positions vacant: Director of Technological Advancement, Arts and Science Representative, Graduate Representative,  and Academic Affairs Chairperson.

Q: What do you plan to do to fill up the open positions? 
SGA continuously attends orientation sessions, recruiting qualified students to join our association and our intern program. We place emphasis on the numerous opportunities through SGA: serving on the Board of Directors, Board of Trustees and/or (state) Board of Governors, compensation, leadership skills, etc. 

Q: How does that compare to the SGA-UP? 
SGA-BBC does not compare its accomplishments to those of the University Park campus. BBC and UP both strive to accomplish our goals and perform to the best of our abilities. What I will say is that a nearly full council is a significant accomplishment for SGA-BBC, something that hasn't occurred in the past few years. 

Q: What do you feel needs the most change at BBC? 
Students have identified that improvements are needed in the areas of general customer service from some student affairs departments, such as the Cashier's Office, Enrollment Services, etc. Other areas include offering more classes and a halt to ever increasing tuition and fees. Students have also identified the need for improved cafeteria services. 

Q: What do you predict will happen to Greek Life at BBC? 
Being a fraternity gentleman myself in Lambda Chi Alpha, SGA has already begun several collaborations with Greek organizations. The approach here is more personal whereby, instead of several men "rushing" one individual, fraternity men on this campus approach quality gentlemen on a one-on-one basis. Some of the events include joint BBQs, step shows, [and] concerts.

Q: How do you feel about the Biscayne Landing construction site and do you think it will affect BBC students?
 It is known in the business world that whenever you see major stores "set up shop," such as Publix, it usually means that the particular area will become a "hot spot" in the real estate market. 

This presents opportunity for BBC to receive significant funding from private donors. There are current talks of major donations to FIU; yet, no specific information is available to date.

Headline: Currie arrested on sexual assault charges
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
Miami-Dade Police arrested FIU police officer Frederick Currie Wednesday and charged him with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman earlier this month, officials said.

Police said Currie, 35, saw a parked car in Tamiami Park at around 2 a.m. on July 8. As he approached the car, Currie apparently saw the woman and her boyfriend inside.

Currie was on duty when he allegedly ordered the couple out of the car and sexually assaulted the woman, who is not an FIU student.

Currie is charged with one count of sexual battery and one count of battery.

Anyone with information on this case should call Miami-Dade Crimestoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.

Look for more on this story in Monday's edition of The Beacon.

Headline: MDPD investigates police officer's sexual assault allegations
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
It was two hours past midnight when university police officer Frederick Currie, 35, approached a suspicious vehicle in Tamiami Park on July 8. That's where it all began.

As he neared the car, Currie may have seen a young couple kissing, university officials said. But it was what he may have done at that point that brought upon a controversial and serious allegation: Sexual assault on the 18-year-old woman inside the car while Currie was on duty, officials said.

That same day, university officials placed Currie, a nine year law enforcement veteran, on administrative leave with pay. Miami-Dade police launched an investigation. 

Although Currie has not been arrested for this alleged incident, President Modesto A. Maidique contends the seriousness of the allegation and said security at FIU will not be compromised.

"We take this kind of allegation very seriously, even more so when it involves a police officer," Maidique said through a written statement. "Ours have always been safe campuses and we have every intention of maintaining a high level of safety for our students, faculty and staff."

While police have not yet released details on this ongoing investigation, The Beacon obtained an official copy of Currie's personnel file - containing hundreds of pages of both problems and praise.

The records show he was twice fired from FIU and was arrested at least three times while working for the university. 

Currie was arrested on charges of domestic battery in December 1996 and September 1998. All charges were dropped in both cases. Then in 2001, Currie was arrested on charges of child abuse. In this case, the jury found him not guilty.

Currie's history of run-ins with the law don't end there. In 2002, he allegedly went to meet his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, Austin Teate, at Teate's job in Weston. While there, Currie and Teate apparently had a long conversation about Currie's ex-girlfriend. 

A Broward Sheriff's Office police report shows the conversation may have been heated. According to the BSO report, Currie allegedly told Teate, "I recommend that you stay away from her or I will kill you, then her, and then use the gun on me."
The report also claims that Currie constantly placed his hand on his gun and allegedly told Teate, "These bullets cannot be traced ... the last guy who I threatened faded away. I suggest you do the same thing."

Meanwhile, Currie's professional evaluations tell a different story. In most cases, evaluators said he exceeded standards and branded him an exceptional officer.

Also in the personnel file are nearly a dozen letters from FIU officials commending Currie for his work, as well as an honorable discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps.

But after reviewing his less-than-perfect record, some may wonder why FIU rehired Currie after firing him twice before. 

"The fact that FIU rehired him is stupid. This guy is apparently violent and he's been arrested before. What makes the school think that he'll be safe with a gun?" said freshman Cristina Moussawel. 

Freshman Miguel Lorenzo disagrees.

"If Mr. Currie was never convicted of any crimes, then he should be allowed to work at FIU," Lorenzo said.

Records show Currie used an outside union, the Florida Police Benevolent Association, and a civil service board to appeal and get his job back. 

Since Currie was never convicted on his two domestic violence charges or the felony charge of child abuse, he was able to reclaim his position both times.

The university has since changed its appellate process. 

Essentially, if Currie or another police officer were to be fired from FIU, an employee appointed by the president would be assigned to hear the case and make the decision whether to rehire the officer, rather than taking the case to an outside agency.

While the appeal can later be brought before the District Court of Appeals, FIU's chief spokesman Mark Riordan said it would benefit the entire university to keep the appellate process in-house.

"An outsider is an outsider. They don't understand our needs as a hearing officer at the university would," Riordan said. "We don't expect, nor is it our intent, to have hearing officers who would find in the university's favor."

Whether or not Currie is arrested or charged, Riordan said the university plans to launch an internal investigation. 

Currie is barred from returning to the campus until the investigation is complete, according to a university statement. Officials ordered him to surrender his weapon, FIU police ID and badge. Currie was not available for comment at press time.

Headline: British professor leads Haitian revolution lecture series
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
An assorted audience of culture and history aficionados gathered at FIU's Biscayne Bay Campus to listen to British Professor David Geggus, who has turned his fascination of the Haitian Revolution into a PhD and traveled the world to shed light on a tale strewn with slaves, controversy and global repercussions. 

Geggus' lecture, entitled "The Haitian Revolution: Big Questions and Small Ones," kicked off the African-Haitian Summer Institute Distinguished Lecture Series on July 6. 

 The lecture was held at the BBC Library  with a gathering of about 30 people that included Vice-Provost Raul Moncarz and Professor Mike Collier. 

"It's really an excellent program because it's interdisciplinary," Moncarz said, referring to the collaboration between the Latin American and Caribbean Center and the African New-World Studies Department in organizing free lectures open to the public throughout the summer. 

According to Moncarz, the lectures started last year, when the Haitian Summer Institute was moved from the University Park campus to BBC. 
 
"LACC thinks [BBC] is a better venue because of location and faculty expertise," Moncarz said. 

Collier, the LACC research director, said both he and Moncarz are teaching Summer B courses on the same days  the lectures take place, Mondays and Wednesdays. 

Moncarz teaches Economics of the Caribbean, from 9:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m.; and Collier teaches International Relations of the Caribbean, from 2:00 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.

"[We want to provide] two days of  complete Caribbean immersion," said Collier, who also organized trips to Haiti until 2003, when major turmoil hit the nation close to the bicentennial anniversary of its independence. 
Haiti became independent in 1804, a fact that came to intrigue Professor Geggus almost 200 years later. 

Geggus, who has been a history professor at the University of Florida for 22 years, said his interest in the Haitian Revolution stemmed from studies that indicated the Caribbean nation's uprising was rather European in origin. 

 "It's hard to imagine the Haitian revolution without the French Revolution," Geggus said as the gathering asked questions regarding his lecture.

 During the lecture, Geggus explained that ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity seeped into Haiti as they became the banner, on the other side of the world, for the 1789 revolution that toppled French monarchy. 

 As France struggled with its own political troubles, a slave rebellion and civil war among races, social classes and regions swept through Haiti in 1791. 

Eventually, under the leadership of former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture, Haiti became the first among the western colonies to earn its autonomy as well as to abolish slavery. 

"[L'Ouverture] was alternatively humane and ruthless," Geggus said, adding that the controversial leader had been freed for 20 years at the time of the revolution and had even owned slaves. 

 But the impact of the Haitian Revolution went beyond its central figures, and beyond the island of Hispaniola. 

 Geggus said the loss of Haiti as a French colony was probably the main factor influencing Napoleon's sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803 He turned his attention to taking over other parts of the world. A free Haiti served as inspiration for Freedom Fighters such as the South American Simon Bolivar, who is credited with the liberation of Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia and Panama from the Spanish Empire in the first half of the 19th century.

 Geggus' lecture itself brought together representatives from around the globe, such as the American Liesl B. Picard, LACC Public Affairs Manager, and  South Africa's Ben Hebblethwaite, a lecturer on Haitian Creole at the University of Florida during the school year and at FIU over the summer.

 Both agreed they enjoyed the lecture.

 "I thought it was very interesting," Hebblethwaite said, "It sort of demythologized ideas on the Haitian Revolution - there are a lot of myths in any culture, and it's fun to hear somebody tear it down and then put it all together."

Guy Metayer, a Haitian who's getting his PhD in Political Science at FIU, had his reservations. 

"The lecture was fine," Metayer said. "However, [Geggus] overemphasized the French impact on the Haitian Revolution - internal forces were also a main catalyst." 

Moreover, Geggus seemed to enjoy the lecture and ensuing discussions. 
"I'm delighted to be here," Geggus said. 

 The next lecture in the series will take place on, July 18 at 6:30 p.m., in Room 155 of BBC's Wolfe University Center. 

 The scheduled speaker is Lola Young, from the National Museum and Archives of Black History and Culture in the United Kingdom. The July 20 lecture on Haiti has been cancelled.

Headline: Elliott's recipe misses key ingredients
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
"Missy be the name that you should already know," Missy screams out in her song "On and On," but after her latest album attempt, audiences might be urged to forget the name. 

For years, hip-hop diva Missy Elliott has gone where no other female rap artist has dared. From singing while wearing a trash bag in "Supa Dupa Fly" to showing off her weight loss in the video for "Work it," she has done it all. Now, with the release of her sixth album, The Cookbook, Missy has strayed away from the originality she was known for and focused more on what audiences want: To simply dance and have a good time.

The album as a whole is packaged very well. The cover-booklet is carried out in the form of a cookbook and written as a menu, with the songs divided as appetizers, refreshments, main course and dessert.  
Most of the songs are intended to make you get up out of your seat and dance, but there is the occasional slow ballad that makes you think, "Wow, Missy isn't cut out to sing ballads." Even though most albums must have some form of variety, she should stick to what the fans want to hear and to what she seems to do best.

One of the main reasons why the album seems so different, when compared to the rest of her work, is that Missy took it upon herself to produce most of the songs. Timbaland, who produced most of the songs in prior albums, only produced two this time around, "Party Time" and "Joy." Ironically, theses were two of the better songs. 

If it were not for the collaboration of artists - including Mike Jones, Slick Rick, Ciara, Fat Man Scoop, Mary J. Blige and American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino - the album would fall short of average status.

On a positive note, Missy preferred to use different musical styles throughout the album, not sticking to her typical hip-hop roots. The album changes from R&B to hip-hop and soul to lavish bohemian sounds from one track to the other. This approach identifies Missy as a versatile artist who can pull off more than one musical genre and appeal to a wider audience.

The song that saves the album single handedly is "Bad Man," featuring Vybez Cartel and M.I.A. The song features what sounds like a marching band with a drumline (which seems to be the direction most artists seem to want to take with their songs now-a-days, including Destiny's Child and Gwen Stefani), and ends the album on a high note.

Compared to her better albums, the recipe for Missy's cookbook is nothing to boast about and, in reality, leaves a bitter taste in the listener's mouth. Maybe she should depend more on the talents of her past producer and focus more on pleasing the fans that have been there since the beginning.

Headline: Semester at sea broadens world views of participating students
Author: Beth Ward / Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service
&nbsp;
Imagine being trapped in your residence hall with close to 700 classmates - plus your professors - for 24 hours a day. The building is where all your classes, meals and social activities take place. You can leave only at designated times and when you do no one speaks English.
While this may sound like a twisted new reality show, it's actually the traditional design of the Semester at Sea program.

Essentially a semester abroad taken to the extreme, students travel around the world, cross the equator and get an up-close look at almost a dozen countries, all while taking classes.

 For the past 25 years the University of Pittsburgh has been the program's home base. Students who go through the program receive their credits from the university. However, Pitt recently announced its decision to cease that sponsorship, citing safety concerns following an incident in January where the ship, the MV Explorer, was disabled by a 50-foot wave.

Tony Fiorini, a Pitt and two-time Semester at Sea alum, said he is disappointed that Pitt decided to end its relationship with the Semester at Sea program but he is confident that the program will survive the change.

"It's happened to Semester at Sea before. It started at Chapman (University in Orange, Calif.), then University of Colorado-Boulder, then Pitt. ... I'm sure they will find another academic sponsor," he said.

Paul Watson, the director of enrollment management for the nonprofit Institute for Shipboard Education, which runs Semester at Sea, said that despite the upheavals, "I see the program thriving and growing."

For Fiorini, his Semester at Sea experience was life changing.

As a student at Pitt in the early `90s, Fiorini wasn't sure what he wanted to do after he graduated. For inspiration, he decided to participate in Semester at Sea during his sophomore year.

The program's 100-day voyage is divided into 45 days in port, with each port visit lasting four to five days, and 55 days at sea.

Fiorini started his trip in 1994 in Vancouver on the SS Universe (which has since been retired). Over the course of the trip, Fiorini, then 20, said he rode horses to the Egyptian pyramids and saw the Great Wall of China, Tiananmen Square and a Russian circus in St. Petersburg.

Beyond the sights, Semester at Sea students are able to interact with local people in the countries they visited, which for Fiorini had a greater impact.

While the trip is an education in itself, students still must take a minimum course load of 12 credits. Each class also has requirements for students in the countries they visit. A required course for all students is global studies, which thoroughly covers the culture and history of each country before they arrive.

"Classes are like nothing you've taken in a normal college setting," he said. "You can be at class in 30 seconds because your cabin is two floors down. You eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with your professors...There's a lot more community."

The classes also focused on the areas they were visiting. In Fioroni's philosophy class they would talk about Buddhism and then visit a Buddhist temple the next day.

"It brings everything you are learning to a whole new level," he said.
 "You come home and your friends are trying to figure out when the next kegger is, and you realize it doesn't matter. You see how other people live. There is a whole lot else out there."

 Fiorini gained more from the trip than just a broad view of the world. It also helped him decide on his career.

"I went to school for engineering so I was taking calculus, chemistry, physics _ it was horribly unfun," Fiorini said. As a way to inject some fun into his life, Fiorini started working as a photographer at the Pitt News, the campus newspaper.

"The pressure and excitement of a deadline was more fun than figuring out vector forces on a bridge that would never be built," he said.
But it was on his trip that Fiorini realized photography could be more than a hobby for him.

"I had done photography for the newspaper but I didn't think of it as a career until I traveled and took pictures all different places and realized I could do it as a living," Fiorini said. "It just made sense for me; I wanted to have an impact. It was semi-naive but I had the `I can change the world' type feeling."

As soon as Fiorini got home from his 1994 trip he knew he wanted to do it again, but it wasn't until 10 years later - after working as a photojournalist for the Reading Eagle in Pennsylvania and The Associated Press - that he was able to.

Watson, the institute's enrollment director, stressed the importance that students see the world beyond their college campuses.

"We have the belief that an international education is valuable... It sounds cliche but we do exist in a global economy and students who prepare themselves for that will have the edge," he said.

Headline: EA Sports NCAA Football 2006 excels
Author: Sergio Carmona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Football season doesn't start until August, but video gamers can get a head start with EA's "NCAA Football 2006," available on PlayStation 2 and X-Box. While the game remains faithful to its predecessors, the new features elevate it to the best of the EA's NCAA Football franchise.

One of the finest features added to any sports game is the "Race For the Heisman" feature. This unique RPG feel starts off in a high school summer camp, where the player tries to impress colleges. As soon as it's completed, scholarships are offered. Once the player enrolls in a selected college, different features can be selected. For FIU football fans, the game also includes the Golden Panther football team.

Following that, the chance is offered to develop into a Heisman hero and win the ultimate prize in collegiate athletics. If successful, the player is able to continue his professional career in "Madden 2006." 

Another new feature is the spring drills, which includes the Pass Skeleton, Oklahoma Drill, Option Attack and Rushing Attack mini-games. These modes are a good way to practice, as well as very addictive. 

The best of these mini-games is the Pass Skeleton because the player is able to improve his player's coverage reading skills and his poise in the pocket. 

The most difficult is the Option Attack because of the stingy defense the computer throws out. It is best is to start on the easiest mode, and then move on to the harder modes, making it easier to improve.

Other features worth mentioning are in-season recruiting, where you can assign a percentage of your recruiting power to pursuing top high school players each week and the addition of an all new in-studio commentary on different team's players prior to kickoff by Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and Brad Nessler.

As far as game play is concerned, a few tweaks have been made to the remote control, where the player will have to tap on the right analog stick to make most of the explosive moves. 

However, it isn't difficult once you get used to it, and the passing is much easier than in previous installments as defensive backs don't react too quickly to balls in the air as they once did. Plus, the Pass Skeleton Drill improves your skill.

The addition of impact players is another notable addition. Here, the two best players, know as impact players, on offense or defense, will be labeled by a white dot. Once the white dot blinks, the player is in the zone, propelling the player to unleash jaw-jarring hits or ankle-snapping jukes. The camera will zoom into the player, propelling you to stare in amazement.

Despite these new additions, this game still remains faithful to the franchise. The same modes, such as the online play, Dynasty and Rivalry game, remain and the abilities to create a player or school remain as well. 

Unfortunately, the traditional mix of rap and rock that's heard doesn't fit well and is the game's biggest weakness. 

However, the sound is still excellent and the dazzling graphics have never been better. This great installment of the franchise is a must have for anyone who enjoys sports games.

Headline: Author Mary Roach explores life after death for human cadavers
Author: Arlene Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A most fascinating and unusual book came to life through the hands of Mary Roach. 

"Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers" is comically filled with facts about what happens to bodies after they die. Roach takes her readers on a journey through death, with quaint chapters such as: "A Head is a Terrible Thing to Waste", "Dead Man Driving", "Holy Cadaver" and "How to Know if You're Dead."

"Stiff" is quite an amusing read, although based on a most dire subject. Nevertheless, readers will find that the author approaches death without fear. 

Roach explains procedures such as practice surgery on dead bodies, human head transplants and the way cadavers are used as human crash test dummies. 

Consequently, some might think that the book is too dark or gruesome, but ultimately, the message presented on how these noble cadavers help to save lives, is brought out across the pages. 

Comical, but never disrespectful to any of her subjects, Mary Roach also enlightens her readers with the many options available for cadavers. She presents the idea that even after death, a human can make a difference in the world by simply donating organs or letting themselves be used for scientific research.

Roach also includes amazing historical research and anecdotes galore. It is a study that goes where no other study has gone before. Readers will remember this book, years after they have read it. On page 93 Roach boldly states that, "For every cadaver that took an airbag in the face, 147 people survived, and for every corpse whose head was hammered on a windshield, 68 lives per year were saved." There is also a chapter on crucifixion experiments in which the history of crucifixions and their effect on the human body are researched. The research shows reasons as to how the body dies when it is crucified.

Disturbing? Yes, but very interesting and witty. "Stiff" is as unusual as it is wise. It is guaranteed that those who read it will never look at death the same way.         

After reading this New York Times best-selling book, the reader might lose their fear of death or will realize that death is a part of the human cycle and miraculous at the same time. The life of cadavers is quite strange, and Roach includes every aspect of their life in this book. From Egyptian embalming to scientific research, all the ingredients for a different kind of reading and for a great post-mortem experience are within the pages of "Stiff."

Headline: Diary of a Frat Pledge - Part 1
Author: Charlene Collazo and Cyntianna Ledesma / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The Beacon decided to follow one potential fraternity member during recruitment week to experience the joys, letdowns, and surprises that men go through when rushing for a fraternity. Many have misconceptions of fraternities or sororities. There are many stereotypes of "pledging" for a sorority or fraternity that develop from the media or society. Sometimes they scare or worry potential members, keeping them from the experience of recruitment.  

This past week, fraternity recruitment took place at the University Park campus. Fraternity organizations were seen preparing for their recruitment parties, proudly displaying their colors and letters. Potential members gathered around seeking the one organization that would make them feel like a true "brother."  

However, when most of these prospective members were stopped and asked if they were interested in joining a fraternity, they always paused at the question and a very bewildered look crossed their faces. Most answered, "I don't know. I'm just looking around to see how it is." One can only imagine how confusing joining a fraternity can be. 

Agustin Barbara, an 18-year-old freshman majoring in biology, spoke energetically to a few fraternity members of Sigma Phi Epsilon. Barbara decided to experience recruitment week in order to get the full "college experience" and become involved in the university. Barbara was one of the few freshmen that kept that bewildered face to himself - even when the word "rushing" was spoken. 

"Even before I knew that I was determined to join a fraternity, all these stereotypes were the least of my worries. I never felt confused or scared. If I would have felt in that position, then I would have never attempted to join," Barbara said.  

The first day of recruitment was July 11. The Greek Barbecue, sponsored by the Panhellenic Council, kicked off the beginning of many FIU students' venture into the Greek Life scene. The event took place in front of the Betty Chapman Plaza at UP. Students were able to speak to fraternity members as well as introduce themselves to the sororities on campus.  

As the night progressed, Barbara browsed the different organizations stationed along the plaza until he came upon, and decided to speak to, Sigma Phi Epsilon. It is always important for the individual to look for a fraternity that interests him, and Barbara was set on getting to know Sig Ep (as they are known on campus) a little better. Many may ask how an individual figures out which fraternity he is truly interested in joining, and as Barbara experienced, it is all about getting to know the members and deciding whether or not one is comfortable with them. 

"I looked around and I felt most comfortable with them [Sig Ep]. The guys I hung out with in high school were just like the guys I spoke to in the organization," he said. 

Monday night turned out to be a success for Barbara as he not only had fun, but also felt great about getting to know this group of men as well as all the people at the Greek barbecue.  

On July 12, was the beginning of most fraternity's social gatherings. These are opportunities for each potential member to create a one-on-one relationship with the brothers of the fraternity of his choice. 

Unfortunately, Barbara could not make it to this event and regretted missing out. He stressed that one should try to attend each event in order to become more familiar with the fraternity members.  

On July 13, was two to three days from the day when the fraternities would unveil their choice of potential brothers. Barbara attended Meet the Sig Eps in order to make up for the night before and to continue meeting the members. The fraternity members introduced themselves to the recruits, informing them of the different community service events and additional information about the fraternity. 

"At the end, we went to the memorial next to the Graham Center for one of the brothers that passed last year," Augustin said. "Everyone is close."
