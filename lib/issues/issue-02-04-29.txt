Subheadline: Abril en Venezuela
Author: Mary Aviles / Zona Editor
&nbsp;
Nunca me había sentido tan desinformada como en abril. Paradójicamente en un mundo tecnificado, comunicado y globalizado como éste no podía saber qué ocurría en mi país. Aún no lo se.

A pesar de estar en Internet, llamar por teléfono, ver televisión y oír radio no tenía nada claro. Lo que empezó siendo una marcha pacífica, el pasado 11 de abril, terminó en una masacre, junto con la desaparición del Presidente Chávez, la auto juramentación de Pedro Carmona, saqueos, silencio y el regreso de Chávez.

¿Fue un golpe? ¿Un autogolpe? ¿Una renuncia? ¿O un vacío de poder? Como afirmó recientemente Otto Reich, Subsecretario de Estado para asuntos Hemisféricos.

La verdad es que no tengo ni idea, lo único es que las cosas no siempre son lo que parecen ser y creo que si de este episodio se hace una reflexión sobre ciertos conceptos fundamentales, entonces la sangre que corrió por las calles de Caracas no fue en vano.

Estos conceptos deberían empezar por definir lo que es una democracia. No puede ser que sólo por hacerse elecciones se hable de un sistema democrático. No puede ser esa la patente de Corso para hacer lo que se viene en gana.

Votar también puede ser un instrumento del autoritarismo como la aprobación de una nueva Constitución a la medida, una Asamblea incondicional, unos poderes públicos supeditados a un proyecto particular y el ataque a aquellos que disienten. No respetar a las minorías y peor aún, las diferencias de criterios, no parece muy democrático.

¿Vive realmente Venezuela una democracia? ¿Un país en el hoy que no hay espacio para el diálogo? ¿Un país dividido en torno a la figura del Presidente de la República? ¿Un país donde ejercer el periodismo se ha convertido en una cuestión de vida o muerte?

Me llama la atención las críticas que se le han hecho a los medios venezolanos en torno a la cobertura de los hechos del 11 al 14 de abril. Hay quienes dicen que hubo una especie de autocensura una vez que se supo que Chávez regresaba al Palacio de Gobierno. Se criticó el desempeño de los periodistas quienes hasta la renuncia de Carmona habían estado allí.

No era una cuestión de miedo como dijeron algunos, aunque el miedo es libre y muy válido, sobre todo cuando hace apenas unos meses un grupo de los denominados Círculos Bolivarianos habían declarado objetivos políticos y militares a varios periodistas.

En una guerra el corresponsal corre el riesgo de ser alcanzado por una bala, accidentalmente. En Venezuela es el blanco. En los últimos meses las agresiones a los periodistas se han incrementado en el país. Algunos, para poder hacer su trabajo, recibieron protección de los cuerpos de seguridad, otros fueron amparados por medidas cautelares de la Comisión de Derechos humanos. 

Entender lo que pasa en Venezuela no puede reducirse a los sucesos del 11 de abril. Es un proceso que se viene dando desde hace varios años, una lucha por el cambio, una lucha que no ha terminado.

Winners

FIU Graduates: After four years of studying, late nights, headaches and dealing with difficult people, you can now go on to a whole new set of headaches, late nights and difficult people. Congrats guys!

FIU Cram Jam: Thanks for providing us with food and a welcome break from our studies. Although, next year, maybe we should consider adding some Barcardi to the coffee. Just a suggestion.  

S.A.V.E. Dade: Kudos for trying to keep the issue of allowing discrimination in housing off our ballots. The sad part is that the issue made it to the preliminary ballots in the first place. For such a diverse city, it's amazing how narrow-minded we can often be.    

Losers

Ally McBeal:  After several seasons of making us doubt your sanity, you've only four more episodes left. Rest assured the dancing baby will live on nightmarishly in our hearts.  

Colin Powell: While we recognize it was a tall order, the fact is your mid-east peace talks failed.  Take heart: in general, many of us still thank the heavens we have you to keep Dubya from nuking us all.   

The Scorpion King: Who knew a spin-off movie starring The Rock could be stupid? Geez, what does it take to please audiences these days? Next thing you know, people might actually start to demand intellectual stimulation – Nah.

Headline: Students need to vote, make voices heard in SGA
Subheadline: Apathetic students shoudl realize SGA's importance, contributions
Author: Asra Jawaid
&nbsp;
Traditionally, effective governments have always been closely linked to their constituents. A generally close relationship means each knows what the other wants and needs. 

This makes sense considering that by definition a government works first and foremost for these citizens. The FIU Student Government Association has been having some trouble following suit. 

According to Malik Wilkes, the SGA elections commissioner, of the more than 30, 000 part and full-time students who currently attend FIU, only 3,500 (3,200 UP campus students; 300 BBC students) voted in the elections held April 2-3. 

Some might consider this an improvement to last year's turnout when only 2800 UP students voted. However, because the Biscayne Bay campus's turnout dramatically decreased (last year 800 students voted there), this year's final tally was less than last year's.

Jessica Morffi, the current representative-at-large and president-elect of the SGA believes that, "[Students] don't want to take time out of their schedules to vote. They don't realize the impact it could have."

The fact is, students need to vote, because they don't realize exactly how much SGA works for them. 

The SGA links the student body with aspects of the school students otherwise might not care or even know about. For example, each school or college elects a representative to the SGA. 

This representative attends the weekly SGA meeting and voices the complaints of members of their college. 

Without this representative, students of that college, along with their concerns, would be pretty much unheard of to anyone outside of that school. 

The SGA also works to provide services to students at large. For instance, they fund SPC and SOC, the governing body for clubs at FIU. 

In addtion, the wireless Internet access available on the first floors of the GC and Green Library can be attributed to the lobbying of SGA, as can extended library hours during finals week and the few days of rest students are given between the last week of classes and finals sometimes known as the Cool-Off period. 

This year, issues discussed included night students' programming, free legal counsel and the school's user outreach program. According to Wilkes, the turnout for this aspect of the campaigns was good, but not repeated when the time came to vote.

According to some students, one of the main problems with voting is the registration process. Thinking they have to take time out of their busy schedule to fill out a long, drawn-out application to register to vote, many students just don't bother with the hassle.

These students, however, are mistaken: as long as you are an enrolled student at FIU, registration is as simple as swiping your identification card in a machine at one of the voting centers.   

Some students claim they don't know where to vote. Unless you make a conscious effort to avoid eating (in the Graham Center), reading (in the Green Library) or, for some of you, living (in the University Park Towers) while on campus missing the polling stations is a pretty hard task to do. 

To make voting even more accessible, a fourth polling station was set up on the College of Engineering campus located north of the University Park campus.

Wilkes and other members of the SGA have already begun thinking of ways to make voting more accessible and widespread among students. 

Some of their ideas include e-mailing students about upcoming elections and computer-based voting. 

But the fact is it's doubtful that these efforts will pay off.  Students already have access to voting, and yet many don't turnout at the polls. Simply put, more than anything, it's our apathetic mentality that has to change.  

For right now, though, the bottom line is this: student government does everything it can to represent the student's interests with regard to the university.   

The jobs of the members of SGA would be much easier if they got a little more feedback and support from the student body they work to represent.

Headline: Finals week, college enslaves students to stress
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
Finals have started and the air is thick with stress.  Nicotine and caffeine have become the almighty gods of college students once again.  I know this from personal experience. After a sleepless night in front of my laptop, I arrive at school and step outside to sit at the blue tables.  

Another sleepless night.  I had spent six hours writing about Neruda's "Heights of Macchu Picchu" for my final project, and it was finally done.  I couldn't believe my mind could handle so much.

I leaned back on the blue chair, sun shining on half of my face, and started to think about the other four finals I had left.  

Thoughts of potential thesis statements, acting techniques, dancing steps, journalism videos, the Fourth and Sixth Amendments traversed my conscious thought.  All these things and more my brain scanned in an attempt, inspired by student paranoia, to review all the information I needed to know for my other finals.

Suddenly, a sense of surrealism flashed before me and for a minute I thought this daze was some kind of divine inspiration. But then I realized it was noon and 24 hours had passed since my last meal, if breadsticks deserve to be called a meal.

I put out the cigarette I should not have been smoking because, technically, I stopped smoking every day and became an occasional social smoker.  

However, finals are my excuse for smoking a cigarette as I sit by myself in the hot and sticky Miami weather.

As I walked into GC, my head felt swollen and my brain numb, but this numbness was a strange one.  I analyzed this feeling a little more in-depth, and although thinking appeared awfully hard to do, I was able to realize the fact that I had a huge migraine.

I felt resuscitated after eating some lunch and taking some Advil.  It felt as if God, Himself, came and breathed life into me.  

I lift up my eyes to the sky and thanked Him for Burger King.

Once I was able to coordinate and function properly, I started thinking about what had just happened.  I asked myself how I could mistreat myself so much. 

Finals week blurred my sense of time, and I lived through the days by drinking Cuban coffee and everyone else around me appeared to be doing the same.

What evil force made me slip into a trance and act like a zombie?  The answer was stress.

Yes.  I openly admit that I am a slave to stress.  Not only am I a slave to stress, but I weakly fall like a victim to it every time I get the chance to do so. 

This weakness is very bizarre because it is as if I want to be a slave to stress out of masochistic obsession.  

This is the only explanation that seems logical.  It is ridiculous for me to stress at the end of the semester, when I have been going to class, taking notes and getting good grades on my work since the beginning.  There is no understandable reason for me to go crazy with so much stress just because it is finals week.

But then again, I think stress is psychologically embedded into our collective unconscious and society can't step away from it.  Once stress fills the atmosphere, as it does now, it is like a contagious disease that runs rampant.

So, I try to be a little more aware of my needs and decided I should treat myself to a shiatsu massage when this is all over.  

I know school is very important and that I must make my sacrifices now and enjoy life later, but for some reason I have a feeling that I will never escape the typical, unnecessary college stress.

I just hope that, in the end, all those sleepless nights and migraines were worth it.

Headline: College fails to prepare graduates for real world
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
As soon as a baby is born, what is it doing? It's crying. It has absolutely no idea what is going on, nor does it have any clue as to what it is doing. So, it cries, yells, flails it's limbs, and all but begs to be returned to the warmth of the womb and away from the doctor's spankings. Well, after you take off that cap and gown, get ready for the spanking. 

Over the past four years or so, you have been in a very comfortable place. One where you have been sustained by the umbilical cord of financial aid, housing, and "forgiveness" policies. You have been doing as much to develop yourselves (or at least your resumes), as you possibly could so that once you left your confines, you would be able to sustain yourself. 

But think about it, most of you have had it pretty good. But now, you're going to leave a cozy little spot in the Graham Center or at the Blue Tables. And why, you ask? Because your "nine months" are up. A few years back, Bill Cosby put it best. He told a graduating class that they were leaving the best job they'd ever have. He warned that, "There's no spring break out here where we are. Christmas holiday is the day itself. On top of that, you'll be starting at the bottom. Some of you will be interns – that's a French word for slave." So, coming from someone who still has a few more "months" to go before I will probably be forced out, perhaps you should think about what you are leaving behind. It isn't perfect, but it isn't bad either when you think about it. 

I'm not trying to say that you should not graduate or not go on to your chosen profession. Just appreciate what you have accomplished (and survived). 

For many of us, this was yet another step in the direction of autonomy. It is like jumping off a bridge, but with a bungee cord that has been thoroughly inspected. 

Almost at the drop of a dime you could change your entire direction, switch your major from political science to religious studies, from environmental science to computer technology. Such a transition would be monumentally more difficult, if not entirely impossible, in the outside world. 

We have been allowed a certain degree of freedom that has enabled us to make sure we know that what we are doing is what we'll want to be doing twenty years from now. At least, we hope. Besides, if you decide you want to do something else, just come back!

To all the graduates, as you are buying your caps and gowns, I congratulate you. It is quite an accomplishment to go through four years of exams and term papers for professors who seem to be increasingly hard to please, and still come out with a shred of sanity. 

Just remember, crying to your professors for extensions might work here, but try not to cry when the professional world spanks you. You'd look pretty foolish.

Headline: College binge drinking remains serious problem
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
College Press Exchange

For parents of high school seniors sorting through college offers this month, the final choice often boils down to picturing how a daughter or son might fit in at the new campus. 

Studies, sports, social life – it's all in the mix at college – decision time.

What parent, though, would ever imagine this scene: their child falling out of a dorm window drunk, or dying in an alcohol-related car wreck? Maybe more parents should.

That's one lesson to be found in the troubling findings of the latest and most comprehensive survey of the impact of campus drinking. 

The study, released last week by a federally appointed task force of the National Institutes of Health, concludes that more than 1,400 college students die annually as a result of injuries and accidents linked to drinking.

Nor are the statistics on injuries and assaults any easier to swallow: More than 70,000 students are sexually assaulted or date-raped, and 500,000 are injured in accidents and fights due to drinking. 

That amounts to four students killed on an average day. 

So the study keeps up the drumbeat for remedies that can rein in a lethal campus drinking culture. Last month, a Harvard study showed that – while more students are abstaining – there are just as many who down several drinks in one sitting as in the early 1990s. 

And when this school year started, the American Medical Association reported that 95 percent of parents viewed binge drinking as a serious threat to students. How right they were.

With its statistical analysis of fatalities, injuries, assaults and reckless drinking-related behavior like unprotected sex, the NIH task force casts a harsh light on undergraduate boozing as merely a rite of passage.

The wreckage of young lives stands in sharp contrast to the gyrations of televised spring-break revelers, or the Animal House story line of the latest National Lampoon movie. 

For every parent who reasons that they celebrated occasionally – and still graduated – today's college officials offer a portrait of a much different campus.

Binge drinking, where it occurs, isn't reserved for weekend nights. "Now it's Thursday night and Wednesday evening. There's a lot more of it around – occasions where drinking is the main thing," explains Graham Spanier, president of Pennsylvania State University, a leader in the fight for solutions.

The NIH study points to strategies that hold promise for coming to grips with the excesses of college drinking. 

Many are being tested at local colleges and around the nation: alcohol-free events, individual counseling, community partnerships to stem off-campus alcohol abuse, peer-to-peer assurances that most students drink moderately or abstain.

Note, those initiatives don't dwell ghoulishly on the dangers of drinking. Such warnings, say researchers, aren't effective with students too young to grasp their own mortality.

But as a community, let's not forget the stakes can be life-and-death.

Headline: In Our View: Education, effort worth more value than diploma
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
It was approximately four years ago (or maybe longer),  that our current graduates first stepped onto FIU grounds, eager to learn and get their monies worth out of their education. Now, as they get their diplomas, they leave jaded, cynical human beings who's contempt for the people around them is second only to doing work. In other words, our graduates are ready for the real world.

Rather than sugar coat the matter, let's address the realities that come with your diploma. It is not a ticket to money, fame, fortune or success. It is not a passport allowing you access to a brand new world of promise and opportunity. It is not even a road map to the future. 

A diploma is nothing more than piece of a paper. Yes, it's fancy paper with pretty embossing and calligraphic fonts, but still as insignificant as something right out of your own home printer.

There's an old adage: "How much effort you put into something determines how much you get out of it." If you found yourself coasting through the year, putting as little work into assignments as possible so long as you get a decent grade, you're in for a rude awakening. It's those annoying students that work their butts off to get decent grades who are going to have a leg up on you. 

That insignificant diploma mentioned earlier is nothing more than a symbol of merit, acknowledging your achievement of pumping enough money into the system and lasting the entire time with somewhat decent attendance and grades. That diploma only matters if you made the best of your time here and actually went about learning about Shakespeare and parabolas and DNA and ethics and the Puritans.

Or to put in another way, it's not the size of your education that matters, it's how you use it.

Headline: Romano graduates, earns sociology  anthropology degree
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Boxes are piled up nearly shoulder-high in an unassuming office within GC 311. Soon, the plaque on the wooden door that says Victor Romano, SGA President, will come down. Soon, the books on the shelves will be gone. Soon, the flyer on the back of his door, which is about a year old, will come down.

Romano, 23, has kept that flyer taped to the back of his door since the day he became president. It keeps him grounded, keeps him focused on the things he told students he would do for them. And bit by bit he's been checking off the list. Most things have been completed, except one.

"SGA supports charity events, the SGA Reach Out program is a success – we visited over 100 clubs and organizations," Romano said. "We increased the funding for clubs and organizations and we now have recycling bins in every office in the Graham Center."

Just about the only thing that's given Romano and student government trouble is a car-pooling program to help mitigate parking problems at his campus. The program did not become a reality because the attendant position at the garage was eliminated, Romano said. A book exchange program is now in the works but won't be up for a while.

"We're going through the process of getting everything finalized," Romano said. "Don't expect it up before the end of my term."

With the help of Gov. Jeb Bush, Romano got to do something every other student government president before him never had the opportunity to do – have a very involved role in governing the university. Bush assigned Romano the post of Student Trustee after he abolished the Board of Regents and established a local Board of Trustees for each of Florida's public universities.

"It's both a great honor and a great responsibility," he said of serving on the BOT. "FIU is truly fortunate in that we have an excellent group of trustees who are really concerned about what's best for the university, its students and its faculty."

Romano sits on the board's transition/academic/student affairs committee.

"We worked on the devolution of powers from the BOR to the BOT," he said.

This afternoon, Romano will graduate with a degree in sociology and anthropology. Graduate school is the next step for Romano.

"I'm in the process of deciding," he said. "It's between Vanderbuilt, Arizona State, the University of Florida and FIU."

He said the past four years he has spent at FIU have been great.

"The best analogy I can think if for FIU is that of a gym," Romano said. "What counts is what you do while you're here. I feel like I've used all the equipment and grown as a person."

This past year, Romano has led student government to the highest ranking in the state, according to Student Leader Magazine, which named University Park's student government the best in the state.

"What pushed us over the edge was putting aside personal agendas and focusing instead on teamwork and unity with what's best for students and FIU always in mind," Romano said. "In past years there were more cliques and more political in-fighting of which there should have been none."

Student government Vice President Diego Martinelli, who said he and Romano complemented each other well, said they had help from the council and the cabinet.

"The realistic goals that we set and getting the right people involved helped us win best SGA."

Romano wants to be remembered "as a president who put students first—that was my campaign slogan and that's what I tried to accomplish. I also want to be remembered as a president who kept students' needs first and foremost."

Romano says the key to being a good president is to "put your heart and soul into the position and always keep in mind the students who put you there and the promises that you've made to them.

Headline: 'Outstanding Senior' gets DOD post
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
"Sprechen sie Deutsches?" Well, Jeldrys Agra, a senior graduating from FIU this morning does and that helped her land a job with the United States Department of Defense.

Agra, 22, begins her stint with the DOD in August and cannot wait to head over to Arlington, Va. and start her career with the department's Office of the Inspector General, a civilian arm of the DOD.

According to the Inspector General Office's website, Agra and her co-workers in the IGO are responsible for conducting, supervising, monitoring and initiating audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the DOD.

"The reports I'll write go online and go to Congress," Agra said.
The department's reports are accessible through its website: http://www.dodig.osd.mil/sar/index.html.

Agra learned of the open position at the DOD through the university's Career Services department. They even helped Agra get in touch with her interviewers in Washington, D.C.

"I interviewed after Sept. 11 over a TV-teleconference," Agra said.

After she passes her drug test, which will be administered sometime between now and August, Agra will start working as an auditor where she will be given the opportunity to travel nearly all over the world. The government might send her on international trips to Germany, Japan and Korea. The DOD could also send her to Hawaii.

Agra said her new job might be a bit of a surprise.

"I don't know what to expect," she said, "but I know I'll like it."

She is, however, aware of some of her basic duties.

"We'll perform audits to see if programs are effective, it's not just about money," Agra said.

"Jely" as her friends know her, is no stranger to money matters. "I used to do all my dad's finances since I was 16," she said.

This past year, Agra worked with University Park's Student Government Association as their comptroller. She helped to disperse over $6 million amongst the student-run clubs and organizations around campus.

"I tried to get [Activity and Service] fees back to the students," Agra said.

Agra, a finance major, trained to become comptroller during her first year at student government as an intern.

"I knew it inside and out," Agra said of being comptroller, "It was my field."

She spent the previous year as SGA's student services representative. One of Agra's accomplishments was getting a bus stop for students using the Golden Panther Express, the shuttle ferrying students between Biscayne Bay and UP, and the CATS shuttle which takes students from UP to the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Her experience as comptroller and her ability to speak fluent German substantially raised her chances of getting the DOD position. But Agra might not have chosen to take German classes without a bit of advice from her father, Jose.

"He told me I already knew Spanish, so I took four years of German at Coral Gables," she said.

Agra also took two semesters of German at FIU.
What impressed her most about the German people that finally helped her settle on studying the language was Germany's resilience.

"Twice they've been stripped of everything and twice they've come back," Agra said.

For her, it was easy to pick up the language.

"When you know English and Spanish, it's easier to learn because its grammar is like Spanish and some words are like English," she said.

Before Agra got to high school, her father and her mother, Natasha Nuñez, took a young Jeldrys on a four-day boat ride across the Florida Straights, from Cuba to Miami, during the Mariel boatlift. Agra only spent four months in Cuba.

After a short time in Florida, Agra and her family once again gathered their belongings and moved to Texas.

"Everyone there is more calmed," Agra said. "I almost fainted my first day in public school in Miami. I'll never forget it. I was in third grade and I'm still shocked."

Later, during middle school, she decided to attend a magnet school for drama but decided to focus on her studies in high school.

"I've always liked drama," she said. "My dad told me to stick to academics so I went to Coral Gables."

In fact, she was able to advance her college career in high school. 
"I got a lot of transfer credits," Agra said.

After from graduating from high school, she chose to go to FIU. By the end of her sophomore year, she was unsure of what she wanted to do with her life.

"I started off with general business because I didn't know what I wanted to do," she said."

One of her mom's friends later advised her to get into accounting because "everybody needs accounting services," Agra said.

As it turned out, it was a good choice for Agra.

"I have friends graduating with finance degrees who can't get a job," she said.

Once she has settled herself in Virginia and has adjusted to life with the DOD, Agra plans on training to become a Certified Public Accountant.
She also sees herself studying law and going as far as getting a doctorate's in the field.

"I'm going to stay in government," Agra said. "I don't know about [getting a career in] politics or [taking] a different government job."

Recently, Agra won an award at FIU that just might make her seem like a bit more of a shining star to whereever she applies to go to law school. One of her professors, Dr. Robert Hogner, nominated her for the Outstanding Senior award, handed out at the Student Life Awards.

Hogner, who's known Agra for two years, felt she was deserving of the award because of her involvement with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistant workshop. Agra headed FIU's efforts to help the community and her leadership, Hogner said, gave the Internal Revenue Service the confidence to have FIU coordinate the program.

"She should have been nominated by many other people," Hogner said. "She's done so much on campus."

Agra decided to lead the workshop, which is held on Wednesdays and Sundays because of her love and dedication to the community. She recently wrapped up an income tax workshop she helped get started last fall.

"We do free income taxes for low income individuals," she said. "We did over 800 tax returns at the West Dade Regional Library.

"If you don't do community service, you don't realize there are a lot of people that don't have as much as you have," Agra said. "You have to give back to the community. It's not just about yourself."

&nbsp;
Four years ago, 35-year-old Connie LaFlamme worked as a hairdresser on Las Olas Boulevard in Ft. Lauderdale. But LaFlamme wanted more for herself. After much thought and with full support from her husband Jim LaFlamme, Connie decided to go back to school and pursue a degree. 

Tomorrow, she will be graduating from the School of Journalism and Mass Communications and the Honors College with a 3.98 grade point average. She leaves FIU with advertising and HC student achievement awards. 

Originally from Northern California, she moved with her husband and stepchildren to Miami five years ago. LaFlamme received her associate's degree from Broward Community College in 2000, and then decided to continue at FIU.

"I wanted to go somewhere with an accredited program, that will be recognized everywhere I go," she said. "Because I want to go to many places."

She praised the faculty in creating practical learning programs. 

"They are professionals in the fields, with experience and great contacts," she said.

"She's great, we just love her," advertising professor Kathleen Donnelly said. "LaFlamme was an exemplary student and an active volunteer for the International Advertising Association.

 "Connie stood out and she was eager to learn," said Sharon Placide, Honors College student services Coordinator. "She was very articulate and while in Spain, she was learning how to speak Spanish." 

Her favorite moments with FIU were traveling abroad. In the Summer of 2000, she was part of the Honors College study abroad program in Spain. She spent three weeks in Madrid and one week in Santiago De Compostela.  

"We studied the art, history and politics of Spain," LaFlamme said. "It was the perfect interdisciplinary experience, following the spirit of the Honors College."

She also participated in SJMC's study abroad program, integrated marketing communications, focusing on advertising and public relations.
 
"On that trip we had a chance to visit top advertising agencies," she said.

She spent two weeks in London and two weeks in Berlin, respectively.  
The group had a chance to interact with  German and English communications students through a series of presentations.

"It was interesting to see the differences and similarities in business ethics from country to country," she said.

All the traveling didn't put a damper on her marriage.  Her husband Jim has been an electrical contractor for over 20 years, and helped her a lot in her decision to go back to college. She said he has been an encouragement and a big support to her.

"It was something that she wanted to do," Jim LaFlamme said. "She has been an inspiration to the whole family. She redirected her life from working to becoming a student."

Jim And Connie met on April 22 in 1987 and were married on the same day three years later. 

 Honors College Assistant Dean and Professor Stephen Fjellman, has been at FIU for 24 years. He describes her as "a non-traditional student."

"I think that she is someone who underestimates herself," he said "She was the best. She was always asking me if she was doing it right, or she asked me if this or that was what I was looking for." 

Fjellman was LaFlamme's instructor for the third year Honors College Seminar called "Aesthetics, Values, and Authority." During that year LaFlamme and fellow classmate, Dan Prather presented a PowerPoint presentation that won an award for mixed media, at the Convocation in October 2001. 

"It was a multimedia presemtation exploring the symbolism and rytuals of death, and dying," La Flamme said.

LaFlamme just completed her 8-month internship with Ryder Systems, Inc. working in the corporate communications as a Public Relations Intern. 

 "I never worked in a corporation environment before," she said, "It gave me a great glimpse of what it is like on the client's side of the industry versus working for an agency that handles all the types of companies." 

Her advice for students who want to major in adversting, "Internship, internship, internship," LaFlamme said. "You must get practical experience, because it not only shows you what you want to do but also what you don't want to do."

Eventually LaFlamme plans on getting a masters degree in communications or English and hopes to teach at a junior college one day.  

"I want to work in the communications insustry for a while," she said. "and then teach so I can give people the big Ah-Ha!"

Headline: Punk styles collide during Souls concert
Author: John  Lovell
&nbsp;
Recently I witnessed the musical evolution of the century.  At the Ovation nightclub in Boynton Beach, a gene pool of rock and roll's offspring gathered and celebrated with amazing performances. Headlining the show was New Jersey punk band The Bouncing Souls, supported by Hot Water Music, a ska/reggae hybrid dubbed The Pietasters and indie punk group  The Curse from Philadelphia. 

The wide variety of music styles and talent created an environment that was key for an above average show. For 15 short minutes, The Curse, a small punk band, poured their energy all over the slowly growing crowd. Although nobody knew their songs, heads were bobbing and feet were tapping. Exactly what an opening band should do. 
 
Next up on stage was the large ska ensemble, The Pietasters. The Pietasters define their music as a combination of Caribbean reggae  and a little bit of the 1940s big band swing music. This is a typical "old school" sound and is very mellow compared to the rest of the featured bands. Some might think it strange to place a slower sound amidst bands with faster tempos, yet The Pietasters fit the bill very well. After a couple of songs, the audience and I exploded into friendly, happy-go-lucky dancing, the highlight of my entire evening. The climax of the Pietasters' set was when they played their well-known hit, "Maggie Mae." Being the odd one of the evening, the Pietasters were under a lot of pressure yet stood proudly and really showed the crowd a great time with their fun and addictive music. A few moments later, a band by the name of Hot Water Music entered the spotlight. 

The foursome exploded into action immediately. Not too punky with their rhythms, with just the right speed in tempo, and not too hardcore or emotional in the lyrical department, it's impossible to say anything about this band other than they rocked. 

The lead singer's voice boomed throughout the nightclub as the crowd melted together in an insane mosh pit. Hot Water Music was perfect for this concert and set the stage perfectly for the evening's main event. This group is worth checking out.

Finally, the Bouncing Souls took the helm. This band represented the punk genre in every way: quick lyrics, hard guitars and fast tempos with songs never exceeding the three minute mark. 

These New Jersey punks commanded an army of fans who sang along to every word with their fists pounding in the air. Their set opened with one of their trademark chanting songs, "Here We Go," and continued on with recognizable ones like "K8 is Gr8," "Hopeless Romantic," "Say Anything" and "Lemar Vannoy." They even showed a semi-sensitive side to the crowd with their punk rendition of The Cure's "Just Like Heaven." 

The lead singer's voice fired each word into the microphone like bullets, with an extremely distinct tone and incredible melody. The show came to a wonderful end with their "Ole" theme song and "A True Believer."
 
Shows like this one, which feature such a variety in music, are becoming less rare, and it makes me very content to know that good rock music hasn't dwindled just yet. I'm anxiously awaiting its future.

Headline: Sheryl Crow comes on strong in "C'Mon C'Mon"
Author: Sarah Wellman
&nbsp;
Something has happened to Sheryl Crow. The girl got happy. Her latest album, C'mon, C'mon, is filled with a pop-like sound that hasn't been heard from Sheryl since her debut album Tuesday Night Music Club. And after 1999's depressing The Globe Sessions, this album is just what Sheryl needs to win back her audience.

Already being overplayed, "Soak Up the Sun" is the first single off the album. By the time the album was released, "Sun" was getting almost as annoying as all of the promotion the movie "Shrek" received. But all that press paid off for "Shrek" and will likely do the same for C'mon: this will catapult the album up the charts.

Other songs that make the album worth listening to: "It's Only Love," (a song written for Stevie Nicks that appeared on Nick's album Trouble in Shangri-La,) takes an upbeat look at the past and shruggingly says: "Ah.. it's only love," and moves on. "Lucky Kid" is just a great rock song. "Safe and Sound" is the only song on the album that's reminiscent of the darkness of The Globe Sessions, but makes up for its sadness by being catchy. "Diamond Road" leaves you hopeful for the future, with lyrics like "When you're lonely/When your heart aches/It's gonna take a little time/To make it to the other side."

Not all of the album is sunny, though. "You're An Original," a not-so-fresh jab at pop stars like Britney Spears and N'Sync, is probably the most annoying song on the album. The song is survivable, however, if you listen to the words and not the music. And if the Britney Spears type annoys you like it does me, the song won't seem so bad.

The last track, "Weather Channel," is a good way to wind down the album but should have been left on the cutting room floor. It doesn't really fit with rest of the album's happy-go-lucky feel. In fact, it is very out of place and very boring. Unlike "You're An Original," the lyrics can't save this one.

Throughout the album, Sheryl gets a little help from her friends. Guest appearances on the album are abundant. Don Henley duets on "It's So Easy," Stevie Nicks does backup vocals on "C'mon, C'mon" and "Diamond Road," Natalie Maines guests on "Abilene," and the biggest surprise is Gwyneth Paltrow (yes, the actress) singing along on "It's Only Love." It's a surprise because she's actually good.

As a whole, C'mon is enjoyable. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this album because its summer-like sound and catchy melodies make it easy to tolerate. Sure, there might be a couple of bumps along the winding road (like "You're An Original" and "Weather Channel") but as a whole the album is a smooth ride.

So, if you are stressed at the end of the semester, take a break and drive to the beach with the top down while jamming to C'mon, C'mon. Then it will seem like summer has already arrived.

Headline: "Murder by Numbers" perfects criminal art
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
"Murder By Numbers" is a twisted commentary on exactly what it takes to commit a perfect crime. Throughout the entire film, the audience is manacled to the screen as twist after twist is slowly revealed. The entertainment comes from the horror evoked as our window into the personalities of the villains becomes progressively wider. Yes, "Murder By Numbers" is a tale of perfection all around, but just like the twists in the plot – this perfection is as backward and as demented as the film's characters. 

The plotline consists of a female homicide detective, Cassie Mayweather (played by Sandra Bullock), who is sent in to investigate the murder of a young woman. She has just been assigned a new partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). As Cassie is investigating the crime and unraveling its mystery, a simultaneous plot is developing as well, as the story of this tortured detective's past is uncovered little by little. Every character in this film is demented – even the good guys. In fact, the only "normal" person is Cassie's boring, all-around-good-guy partner, Sam. Ironically, this normalcy comes across as a negative trait because Sam is the most forgettable of all the film's characters. The scariest of all, however, are the two villains: Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These two high school boys are the epitome of insanity; they are dementia personified – especially Haywood.

Some would argue that the definition of a truly evil person is one who commits crimes without reason or regret, and most certainly are deliberate and take pleasure in their acts. If this is true, then the two criminals are evil all the way. The two boys come together to plan and carry out the perfect crime – Justin as the brains and Ritchie as the brawn. Their plan is so incredibly foolproof that the fact a human being thought of it is downright frightening. Even more chilling are their motivations and methods of picking the victim. They commit the crime just to prove that they are free and they can randomly hurt anyone. Halfway through, the film tries to create a soul in one of the villains – it's no secret that Hollywood romanticizes crime. However, it is to no avail – you still despise him at the end and hope he gets all he deserves. There is even a bit of romance for him, but all this does is make your skin crawl every time the unfortunate girl kisses him.
 
There could not be a more perfect title for the film – the crime truly was carried off in an incredibly structured and perfectly numerical way – like clockwork. The villains almost made it seem like a math problem. The downfall of these frightening individuals is the fact that they are human. When you put together two people who are trying to do something they feel is great, make sure you leave room for jealousy, guilt and selfishness. These are the elements that seal their doom. Emotion should never come in the way of one's job – no matter how dastardly it is. As the criminals proved, this is a sure way to fail. Human beings are not perfect and so, comfortingly, it would be impossible for them to commit a perfect crime – this is one of the things the film is saying.

The best aspect of the film's storytelling is the flashbacks. They are the key in the film's twists because either you don't realize at first that they were a flashback, or you are left thinking one thing and then, later, find out a much different story. These flashbacks are what keep the audience a prisoner so that it is impossible to look away – even through the chilling developments and gore.

At first, Bullock plays the same character yet again: a misunderstood, unappreciated woman cop who, in the end, will gain the respect of all her male co-workers. Think "Miss Congeniality" – horribly clichéd. However, this soon fades as her character has an interesting reaction to all the torment and the audience realizes that she is dealing with some major issues. Bullock does a decent job at her portrayal, but it is a bit hard to accept sweet Ms. Bullock as such a messed-up person. Ryan Gosling, on the other hand, is beautifully insane. He does an incredible job with his character. There are these mouth-dropping moments where it really is believable that he is purely demented. When trying to get a handle on his personality while having to constantly re-define the angles of his mind, the audience will soon realize that for Richard the only certainty is that he is truly evil. Gosling has come a long way from his days in "Young Hercules" and "Breaker High." 

If murder thrillers are your weakness, then "Murder By Numbers" is a must-see; but let's hope you are able to sleep with the lights on afterwards.

Headline: New Alanis album needs "Rug" swept
Author: Jennifer Mosconi
&nbsp;
Listening to "Hands Clean," the first single from Alanis Morissette's new album Under Rug Swept, I became hopeful. Maybe this album would be worth getting. Perhaps it would blend the anger of Jagged Little Pill with the introspection and mystical themes of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. 

Instead, I feel dirty listening to Under Rug Swept. I'm like the bratty little sister that found her big sister's self-help diary and couldn't resist taking a peek.

Under Rug Swept is Stuart Smalley in album form. It's Alanis Morissette saying to the world: "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and, gosh darn it, people like me." If you think this is a good concept for an album, perhaps you've inhaled too much patchouli. Lyrics like "…once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am/but I know I won't keep on playing the victim" seem incredibly deluded considering she makes quite a good living writing songs about how she has been victimized.

Despite the obvious irony in some of her lyrics, the album is tolerable. The songs are catchy and grow on you with each listening. Alanis Morissette has always been good at capturing emotions and on this album she has a song for every mood. 

If you feel like laying on your bed and being depressed, try listening to "Flinch," "That Particular Time," and "Utopia." If you're sick of men, "Narcissus" is your track. If you feel like an exploited Canadian teen pop sensation, go with "Hands Clean."

Morissette strikes out on her own on this album. After two albums with Glen Ballard as producer and songwriting collaborator, she has learned to create an album on her own and has written and produced all of the tracks on Under Rug Swept. 

What she creates is a folk-rock album interspersed with the odd dash of hip-hop beats and hard guitars. Her voice still alternates between soothing and nasally irritating, most evidently on "Narcissus" and she's still trying to find the perfect man, (see "21 Things I Want in a Lover"). 
However, the anger and wit that made Jagged Little Pill so potent has been muted. All that's left is a shell of an album, containing music rife with trite sentiment.

I'm conflicted in this review. I am a fan of Alanis Morissette, and I really want this album to be better than it is. Sadly it isn't. 
I'm all for music being cathartic, but it has to also be worth listening to if I'm going to buy the album. My advice? Skip this one, and pick up her last two albums.

Headline: R. Kelly and Jay-Z bring out "Best of Both Worlds"
Author: Otmara Soberanes
&nbsp;
It's evident that the controversy now following R. Kelly after the release of incriminating tapes that find him having sex with a 14 year old girl is taking a toll on the artist. However, it's not taking away his talent or his ability to be one of the best producers in the industry. A proof of this is his latest album, The Best of Both Worlds, which he co-produced with rapper Jay-Z.

Best of Both Worlds mixes R. Kelly's sexy R&B with Jay-Z's smooth rap, resulting in a unique blend of styles. This album includes 13 songs by the two giants of their respective genres, featuring collaborations with artists such as Beanie Sigel, Lil'Kim and Devin the Dude. 

The title song in the album, "The Best of Both World" dives right into the action with a high beam beat that combines both Jay-Z's and R-Kelly's musical tendencies with a message of respect and strength to those who represent both R & B and Rap. This first song has the essential hook that is needed to keep the listener tuned to the rest of the CD.  Among some of the best songs is the popular first single, "Get this Money," marked by a catchy rhythm that forces you to nod your head from the beginning to the end. Its chorus ("You got what I want/ you got what I need"), keeps you singing even after the song is done. Another track that has a great clapping beat is "Shake Ya Body," featuring the unrepentant Lil' Kim.

Hard to ignore is "The Streets," one of the album's most accomplished songs. This song not only has good music, but also shining lyrics, adding an unexpected depth to the proceedings. Its message of making it through the streets and not letting them take the best out of someone resonates. The song tells the story of a man following after his father's footsteps and making it through the streets as a thug. It's the old story of a hardened criminal trying to make it through life, but R. Kelly and Jay-Z give it that fresh touch that takes the cliché to a whole new level. 

The entire album is magnificently produced. Lush songs like "Naked" and "Green Light" bring you back to R. Kelly's sexy style of olden days. Other tracks like "It ain't personal" talk about "being real," sending a raw message to those who are fake and are trying to bring the duo down; the friends will overcome all that by achieving musical success. R. Kelly has been able to stay in the industry for over 10 years, not only as a performer but also as one of the best producers out there. Now with this ambitious concept album he proves himself to still be one of the masters in the world of R & B, and we should be able to separate that talent and achievements from his personal life. As for Jay-Z, he also does a good job. Together, they bring the best out of both musical worlds.

Headline: Pointless "Scorpion King" lacks sting
Author: John Lovell
&nbsp;
When the closing credits for "The Scorpion King" rolled, all I could think was "What happened to the movie?" 85 minutes of clanging swords, zipping arrows, crunching fists and really stupid dialogue ended with a bang and then fizzled before I could even decide what this movie was actually about. Sharing the screen with Michael Clark Duncan, wrestling sensation "The Rock" makes his major acting debut with a reprisal of the small, also pointless role from last year's "The Mummy Returns."
 
This time around we are thrust back to pre-Biblical times and into the infamous sin-city of Gomorrah. Smack dab in the middle of a giant sand dune, where insects outgrow small rodents, an evil and apparently British warlord named Memnon threatens to dominate the entire world and promises to bring (gasp!) law and order. 

Memnon's secret for a successful campaign of death and destruction lies within the psychic powers of a magical and beautiful sorceress. The plot thickens when an assassin named Mathayus, The Rock, is sent to kill her. Instead, he rescues the sorceress and after his brother dies at the hands of the evil Memnon, Mathayus swears vengeance; or in the words his wrestling alter-ego, asks him if he "smells what the Rock is cookin'?" Of course, the crazy "jabroni" gets what's coming to him; after all, Mathayus is "the people's hero." 

Thus goes the story of "The Scorpion King" and I still don't get it. This movie's plot screams with the same immaturity of both "Mummy" flicks. The franchise has it down to a science: cool graphics, great action, cheesy acting, extra cheesy script. The creators of the film took one good look at that formula and decided it needed to be multiplied by 10, hoping and probably praying for better results. The script must have been embarrassing for the actors to swallow, especially with curdled lines such as: "The blood of the Scorpion will live in him forever," which made me laugh enough to merit a "shh" from the theater audience. Unlike "The Mummy," which was at least somewhat entertaining, "The Scorpion King" leaves you like a child, babbling your lips with your fingers.

One would hope that since so much plot has been sacrificed, the action sequences should be pretty breathtaking. The sad fact is, the action in "The Scorpion King" is about as mediocre as its plot. Bones break in almost every scene, minus the PG-13 love sequence and sure, the dueling blade scenes are choreographed well, yet they happen so often that the piercing "shaawing" noise eventually makes your head crinkle. 
Even when the swords are sheathed, arrows are constantly flying by, and in the land of The Scorpion King, arrows come in three flavors: regular, flaming and arrow a la poison de scorpion. 

At times, there is so much fist fighting, sword swinging and arrow flinging going on that it becomes very difficult to guess who's winning the battle. The thumping background score of techno-Egyptian-rock doesn't really help this confusion either. 

If there is one thing that saves this movie from almost total damnation, it is the scenery. Amazing backdrops and beautifully designed sets, some of which were also used in Stanley Kubrick's "Spartacus," describe the world of the Scorpion King with amazing detail. From the fast-paced streets of Gomorrah to Memnon's palace halls, the set designers for this movie did a wonderful job recreating the ancient atmosphere. I only wish the movie that took place on these sets was equally magnificent.

"The Scorpion King'"s release is perfectly timed, right before the summer box office lineup of killer films. This effectively earns it money without the effort of having to compete with movies like "Spiderman" or "Star Wars: Episode II." It also seems like The Rock is trying to take Arnold Schwarzenegger's place as the action star everybody wants in their movie. The Rock will discover that it's quite difficult to do that with movies that lack so much substance like those associated with the "Mummy" franchise. Until he is cast for a better role in a better movie, The Rock should consider keeping his day job and making sure people know exactly what he's cookin'.
