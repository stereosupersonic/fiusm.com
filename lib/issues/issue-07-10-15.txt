Headline: Ex-neo-Nazi, students to talk diversity issues
Author: Douglas Forte  / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Embracing their individuality, the FIU student body will get to celebrate Diversity Day on Oct. 18 at Biscayne Bay Campus.

"The program has been running successfully for the past seven years and this year the focus is going to be on turning away from hatred," Diann Newman, Assistant Director of Hospitality and Chairman of the Diversity Committee, said. 

"Through celebration and reflection, the day will focus on the multicultural buildup and hatred related issues it presents in today's society," she said. 

The event's keynote speaker will be T.J. Leyden, a reformed white supremacist. 

After committing 15 years to being a neo-Nazi and recruiter, Leyden had a reawakening and now devotes his time to fighting hatred, working for five years at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization, to spread his message. 

Leyden has spoken to more than 650,000 students and been invited to the White House by former president Bill Clinton.

"[This year's] theme, centered around the topic of Leyden's speech, is also timely in light of current hatred and racist incidents. It will be an interesting and enlightening presentation." Craig Cunningham, director of Campus Life and Orientation, said. 

Newman believes it is important to have a speaker from Leyden's background,

"It shows that people can change and a difference can be made," she said. 

Along with Leyden's presentation, there will be an array of activities for students to engage in.

"[They] are all structured to expose stereotypes and take on problems attached to them," said Newman. 

There will be a public speaking contest in which three participants will speak for three to five minutes on the usage of lyrics and language in the media, as well as the Diversity Circles discussion forum to openly discuss event day topics.

There will also be a video, Ouch that Stereotype Hurts, that will educate attendees about embracing diversity and resisting stereotypes.

Stephen Neall and the theatre department will perform a play in the Marian Wolfe Theatre, according to Newman.

"It is an excerpt from the play "The Colored Department" which is going to show a black man stripping away his character to be accepted in the corporate world," Newman said. 

"It deals with the complexity of the social world and how one changes to be more accepted in a certain social group," she said.

After the play, keynote speaker Leyden will make his presentation and a closing event will mark the end of Diversity Day.

LaShandrea Rogers, secretary for the Diversity Day Committee, stressed the importance of the event, saying "it allows the campus to come together as a whole and attack racism in an upfront manner." 

Students can call Rogers at (305) 919-4521 for more information about Diversity Day events and activities. 

"I have been to almost all since 2001 and they have been outstanding with unique themes and activities," said Cunningham. "It will benefit people from all over."

Headline: FIU alum talks Pulitzer, books
Author: Elsa Reinoso / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Johnny Diaz, an FIU School of Journalism and Mass Communication alum who won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news, remembers the circumstances in which he reported on the Elian Gonzalez story. 

"Everyone at The Herald went into full warp-speed mode and I was dispatched to gather some quotes from people in Fort Lauderdale/Broward," Diaz said. 

Diaz wrote about Broward County residents' reactions, contributing to the larger reaction in South Florida.

"I was surprised by the award because I had forgotten I had done anything related to the Elian Gonzalez stories," Diaz said. "Then a year later I was told that my name was on one of the reaction stories selected for the award."

Beginning as an intern for The Miami Herald at 15, Diaz's passion lay in features, stories that aren't hard news.

"He knew he was a features writer [at] heart," said Anne Vasquez, SJMC alumna and current Business Editor for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. "I remember when he worked as a cop reporter for The Herald he always freelanced for the feature section on his own time."

Vasquez and Diaz met as FIU journalism students, becoming close friends when they interned the summer of 1995 for The Boston Globe.

Diaz now writes features for The Boston Globe's City Weekly section.

"What better job can you have that pays you to sit down and get to know people and their interests everyday?" Diaz said. 

But Diaz has not limited himself to newspaper writing. 

In May he published his first novel, Boston Boys Club, where he narrates his own tale of the city and adapting to a new home, being away from family, trying to find that special someone and ones place after college through the eyes of three gay male friends.

"I wanted gay and non-gay readers to relate to one of the characters and their issues." Diaz said. "I feel we've all had a friend who has had issues with opening his/her heart and all have one of those friends whom we turn to when we need help the most."

Diaz described his book as a mix of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's Dirty Girls Social Club and the former HBO series "Sex and the City."

"I think that it's a story that's not rife with tragedy as many gay stories usually are," said Eric Vasallo, help desk manager for MTV Latino and Diaz's friend. "I feel he portrayed a very accurate picture of a slice of our society that just happens to be gay." 

Diaz said he is trying to present a fuller image of being gay and Latino so people can see those stereotypes are far from the truth.

"Writers write about what they know and I know a lot about being a gay reporter from Miami," Diaz said, "I would have [a] hard time writing about [someone like] a straight engineer from Tulsa."

Diaz is working on his second novel, Miami Manhunt, about a gay Miami movie critic, his straight twin brother and their rivalry in their Cuban-American family in Coral Gables. It will be published next summer.

Headline: Handling Hangovers: Prevent, cure effects of over-indulgence
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ana Neder, a senior majoring in exercise physiology, remembers her first and last hangover experience for her 21st luau birthday celebration.

"All I remember was having a really bad headache and feeling horrible," Neder said. "I never wanted to drink again, and if I could avoid it and it meant not drinking, then I was fine with that."

Hangovers, also known as veisalgia, usually occur after a person has one too many drinks past their limit. 

Within several hours of the last drink, an alcohol consumer might experience nausea, headache, diarrhea, dehydration or rapid heartbeat. Alcohol poisoning is also possible if the person consuming the beverages has one (or five) too many in the span of an hour.

Most hangovers go away eight to 24 hours after consumption of the last drink. 

According to health web site Pub Med (www.pubmed.com, 75 percent of the people who drink until intoxication will have a hangover the following day. 

Alcohol stimulates the body to produce  an increased amount of urine, and as a result, it leads to dehydration, which makes the person feel dizzy, light-headed and thirsty. 

Another factor leading to these symptoms is the lowering of blood sugar levels; when it goes too low, a person may experience fatigue, weakness, shakiness, and mood swings. 

Headaches also are caused when the blood vessels in the body expand when because of alcoholic consumption.

An active ingredient in alcoholic drinks is congeners, what gives alcohol its flavor. Congeners are found in larger amounts in dark liquors such as brandy and whiskey (which is also known as Scotch when it is from Scotland). 

Clear liquors such as vodka and gin do not use congeners in larger quantities and therefore tend to cause hangovers less frequently. 

Aside from focusing on clear liquors, there are other ways to curb the risk of a hangover after a night out with friends.

Mariela V. Gabaroni, assistant director of the University Health Services recommends drinking water in between drinks.

 "In doing so you are keeping your body hydrated and you are drinking less alcohol," Gabaroni said.

Some remedies to help get rid of hangovers are to drink Gatorade or eat a piece of toast or crackers to help your body stay hydrated, thus returning your blood sugar levels to normal.

"You also want to avoid Aspirin because it aggravates the stomach, which at that point you don't want to have, and Tylenol in excess amounts causes you to have liver damage, so it's better to use Advil," Gabaroni said.

Some students, like Edward Ng have tried getting rid of hangovers by having more of what made them sick in the first place.

 "I like to drink a beer when I wake up from a hangover because it makes me feel better, If not, I have a big meal and a glass of milk," he said.

 Remedies such as the one Ng uses are a common misconception, however.

According to Gabaroni, drinking more doesn't make the situation any better but actually worsens it. 

Coffee or caffeine doesn't help either; they just make the person more alert while still being intoxicated. 

Time is the only factor that gets rid of a hangover and having alcohol in your blood stream.   

If a student is going to go out and drink with some friends, web site HealthMad (www.healthmad.com) recommends to eat a bag of potato chips or a sandwich an hour before you start drinking because it helps absorb some of the alcohol before it gets the chance to be absorbed into your bloodstream. 

Another thing to keep in mind is to avoid alcohol in carbonated drinks because it absorbs more quickly than in non-carbonated drinks.

Neder learned her lesson the first time around, and after two months of not drinking, she learned a way that helps her avoid getting hangovers.

"I learned that if I just drink water after every drink, I won't wake up feeling [bad]," said Neder. "I also always try eat something before going out to drink since it slows down the process of getting drunk."

Headline: Women's fraternity aims to raise arthritis funding
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst News Director
&nbsp;
Arthritis is a condition that affects millions of people throughout the country, but don't accuse the members of FIU's chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi Women's Fraternity of being stiff in the joints.

"Raising awareness is the first step in finding a cure," said Michelle Narganes, the vice president of administration for AOII in a press release. 

More than 20 million adults live with osteoarthritis and more than 300,000 children live with a form of arthritis. This year, FIU's chapter of AOII is trying something a little different to raise funds for arthritis awareness: The Alpha Male Competition. 

"It's a real pageant, but for guys," said Lauren Perez, the AOII philanthropic chair.  

Seating for the pageant will cost $5 for regular seats and $7 for VIP seats during pre sales and $8 for regular seats and $10 for VIP seats at the door. VIP seats will be in front of the stage and come with free food and drinks. Doors open at 7 p.m. in the Graham Center Ballroom on Tuesday, Oct. 16.	

"We are so excited to have this event because we feel that this is a great way to raise money for arthritis research while putting on an entertaining show," Perez said in a press release. 

During the pageant, 14 male students will compete for the title. The first task for the 14 contestants is making their own toga to be worn during the pageant. Contestants will be judged on their creativity and execution of the toga.

"We normally do a comedy show," Perez said. "This is our first time to try this event."

The organization is still keeping part of their comedy tradition; one portion of the competition involves making the AOII sisters laugh. Naturally, the person who makes the sisters laugh the most will win that part of the competition. 

Tyrone Coleman, Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity brother, entered the competition to show support for a friend who asked him to enter, and his plan to win the title of Alpha Male is a rather simple one.

"I plan to be myself," Coleman said. "If everything goes the way it's supposed to, I'll win."

There will also be a talent portion and an arthritis trivia portion of the pageant, so looks and charm alone won't be enough to earn the title of Alpha Male, but it will be to earn the people's choice title.

To raise more money, the people's choice category allows pageant attendees to drop money into bins designated for their favorite contestant. The person who has the most money in their container by the end of the pageant will win the People's Choice award. 

Besides the cause and fun, the pageant is also a way to for the AOII to prove themselves to FIU as the youngest sorority on campus. 

"I want everyone to be aware of Alpha Omicron Pi," said Blanca Cuervo, an Alpha Omicron Pi sister who is helping put the Alpha Male competition together. "We want people throughout the community and not just the Greek community to attend." 

All proceeds of the event will go to sponsor juvenile arthritis and arthritis research. Perez hopes the event will be able to raise at least $2000. 

For more information on arthritis, visit www.arthritis.org and for more info on AOII and their first ever Alpha Male Competition, see their web site at www.fiu.edu/~aoii/.

Headline: Review: Radiohead - In Rainbows (Music)
Subheadline: Band releases album online without fixed price
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
So the other day, I did something crazy. I went online, downloaded a CD and didn't pay for it. 

I had no fears that a team of armed men would storm my dorm and find me hiding in my closet, a burned Memorex CD clutched in my arms. 

Nor did I think of the image of the distraught record company CEO, wringing his hands over declining sales.

Clearly, this was not your every day album release. 

In fact, this release, In Rainbows, Radiohead's seventh studio album, was released in anything but a conventional way. Following the completion of their six-record deal with Capitol, the band was free from the constraints of the modern record game. 

Taking advantage of this rare opportunity to control not only the distribution of the record, but by denying reviewers advance copies, Radiohead decided to set up a web site where their fans could literally pay whatever they wanted for the new record. 

More than a million fans responded in the first two days of release, with many paying nothing for the album, but with many others essentially donating whatever they felt was a fair price for the record.

But does the quality of the album match up to what fans feel they should be paying for it?

Beginning with "15 Step," a schizophrenic semi-dance track featuring a trip-hop beat, and on down to "Videotape," the album's plaintive closer, In Rainbows is well worth whatever price you spend on it.

Prior to the album release, the band said that the album was, at various times, the most  "lush, sparse, and  creepy" thing they had done, and while those descriptions might seem almost contradictory, the band finds a way to make them fit on almost every track. 

Take "Nude," the album's third track, for instance. 

The slow waltz-like pacing of the song allows room for the song to meander from a soft, methodical guitar intro that eventually gives way to ominous synthesized strings that bring to mind "Exit Music For A Film" from their 1997 release, Ok Computer, before fading out as silently as it began. 

In fact, all over the album, there seem to be references to their earlier work, with the outcome being something like one part great leap forward, one part greatest hits package.

"Bodysnatchers" features arguably the best riff Radiohead has written since The Bends, their last "conventional rock" album. So while it rocks in a very conventional sense, it also harkens back to "The National Anthem" off of Kid A, especially around the one minute mark, where the simulated sound of a spaceship landing sounds lifted straight off of that track, not to mention the frenzied Yorke vocal that matches the intensity of the last few minutes of "The National Anthem."

And speaking of Yorke's vocals, he has never sounded as good as he does on this album. From the way he rides the beat on "15 Step" with his signature falsetto, to the intensity of the vocals on the aforementioned "Bodysnatchers" to the echo-drenched "House Of Cards", with his pained plea "I don't want to your friend,/ I just want to be your lover,"  

Yorke dominates this album after consciously pushing himself into the mix to feature as just another instrument on recent releases.

Overall, In Rainbows is another strong addition to the impressive Radiohead catalog, proudly standing beside classics as Kid A and Ok Computer and giving further credence to their status as the most important band in rock and roll.

Headline: Review: Urinetown (Theatre)
Subheadline: Oddly titled musical delights the heart, strains bladder
Author: Ashley Capo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's hard to believe that the Miracle Theatre, a staple of the historical Coral Gables shops on Miracle Mile, is celebrating its 20-year anniversary this 2007-2008 season.

 It's even more shocking that the theatre decided to kick it off with a musical that admits its name alone would keep most theaters from placing it on their production schedule.

The staging of multi-Tony award winning Urinetown, the Musical (yes, you read correctly, "urine" town) was quite a feat to accomplish, according to its director and artistic director for the Miracle Theatre David Arisco. 

After nearly eight years of waiting, he was finally able to find support during the right season to introduce this satirical comedy to the typically mature, reserved audience that subscribes to the theater.

Set in a future where a 20-year drought has forced the people of a town in Any State, USA, to use and pay for public toilet usage. Officer Lockstock, the misogynistic, eccentric head of police and narrator of the show, introduces the audience to the dank streets of this apocalyptic place with, what else, an extensive line of filthy-looking townspeople who squirm impatiently as they wait for their turn to use the rest room. 

Although the musical seems a bit far-fetched, this show is anything but serious. As Officer Lockstock, played by Jim Ballard, quickly squashes in the beginning of the performance, referring to the musical as an entity of itself, this show is very much a "musical" about Urinetown, a place that is mentioned throughout the show but no one really knows what or where it is "until Act II;" even going on the say that the place is "filled with symbolism and things like that."

The story revolves around our hero Bobby Strong, played by Tally Sessions, a young everyman who works for the strict penny-pinching owner of the bleak and ultimately disgusting urinal in that particular part of town, Penelope Pennywise. After his father is denied a free entrance to the potty, 

Ms. Pennywise is quick to sing of the "privilege to pee" in which she details how the town's toilet system was changed by the politicians who "made illegal public urination and defecation." 

After Bobby's dad can't take the strain on his bladder anymore and relieves himself, he is quickly carried off by police to the ominous Urinetown.

The other hero, and love interest in the show, is Hope Cladwell: the daughter of Caldwell B. Cladwell who owns the Urine Good Company (UGC for short), the company that owns all the public toilets. Her purity of heart, and ability to understand their palpitations, are what drives Bobby to start a revolution to free the town of their bonds to paying for pee-pee time.

With government restrictions on everything from toothpaste confiscation at airports to our very own water restrictions, the symbolism of the big bad company hurting the poor townspeople didn't fall on deaf ears. 

The show is very much a comedy, but the writers of the show, Mark Hollman and Greg Kotis, didn't cut corners in their dialogue to make their point. Songs like "Don't be the Bunny," sung by Cladwell, and "Cop Song" are all in jest toward the ignorant people of the town.

Throughout the show it seemed that no one could avoid having the unnatural, yet very natural, urge to pee. Intermission was, indeed, a very real line at the bathroom where ushers collected funds for "The Greening of the Gables," a charity that provides plants and trees for the preservation of Coral Gables.

As much fun as the show was and as many times as the company had to pause for laughs, the musical is not a happy one. As forewarned by the narrator throughout the piece, the ending is actually realistic toward the politics of the town and fall to the death that Urinetown actually is. 

Urinetown, the Musical is most definitely an event to catch for the potential leaders, revolutionaries and businesspeople of the world. It's worth watching, if not to listen to an entire two hours of potty talk, then at least to appreciate an artistic interpretation of the political machine, as well as your own free-of-charge privilege to pee in your home.

Headline: TUITION INCREASE IMMINENT: Legislature cuts financial aid by $ 65 million
Author: Charlie Grau and Christina Veiga / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Full time in-state students are one step closer to higher tuition rates come Spring 2008.

In an effort to trim $1.1 billion from the Florida state budget, the Legislature approved a tuition increase, as well as cuts to financial aid, education and healthcare providers' budgets Oct. 12.

The legislation now goes to Governor Charlie Crist, who has opposed a similar tuition hike this past summer. It is not clear whether he will veto the Legislature's vote this time around.

If approved by Crist, university and community college students will pay 5 percent more for tuition beginning January 2008. The legislation also includes a technology fee of up to 5 percent of tuition and allows universities to automatically raise tuition every year based on the rate of inflation. 

In-state students will pay $55 more per semester for 15 credit hours, in addition to the technology fee. 

The increase will generate $9.5 million in additional funding for Florida universities, according to Bill Edmonds, director of communications for the Florida Board of Governors.

University President Modesto A. Maidique was pleased when he heard about the Legislature's decision to increase tuition.

"This is a great deal, but it ceases to be a great deal if the Legislature doesn't continue funding us properly ... our tuition is $2,000 less than the national average," Maidique said.

FIU stands to gain $2.5 million over the next year, according to David Wartzok, vice president of academic affairs. This will help offset the $3.7 million that Wartzok says FIU is slated to lose this year. 

In total, state universities budgets were cut 3.6 percent, which translates to a loss of over $94 million. The Legislature has offset these cuts to about $65 million by using non-recurring dollars. This non-recurring amount is available for one year only. 

This means that universities will be faced with making the same budget cuts again next year, unless the Legislature can find new money to fill the breach, Edmond said.

Tied into the tuition increase and the technology fee is a measure that would allow universities to increase the price of tuition based on the cost of living. The BOG believes that this a small step in the right direction but doesn't necessarily believe that it will help Florida public universities increase the quality of education.

"Inflation adjusting to tuition is not very much. In recent years, that would result in a 2 percent tuition increase," Edmonds said. 

That would mean tuition increase of $20, big deal. Twenty dollars, you might spend that shopping in one night ... you don't really hire that much faculty with that, that's not a lot of money."

Even though the University is slated to lose $7 million in state funding, its medical school may seem safe for this year.

The College of Medicine is expected to lose almost $170,000 in funding this Spring semester, but it is also expected to receive an equal amount of non-recurring funding. Though the medical school will not lose any money this year, FIU or the Legislature will have to come up with that money the following year, since the funds are non-recurring.

The Legislature also voted to cut financial aid by more than $65 million although the cut would have been deeper had the Legislature not used some non-recurring dollars. 

Edmonds said that 30 percent of the revenue that will be created by the tuition increase will be used to offset the cuts made to financial aid.

Edmonds said that the cuts are necessary.

"If we don't make these types of changes, we're not going to be able to provide the type of education that you or people who come after you need in a highly competitive market place."

Headline: Media spins comments out of context
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
One cannot go a day in politics, or any other medium under public scrutiny, without stumbling across a new controversy regarding semantics. 

Usually, one politician will make a comment regarding a current event. The media will then take that comment completely out of context and distort it so that it seems like something much more malicious than was intended.  For the next week, discussion of this comment will dominate the airwaves. 

If it seems like I've got this process down to an art, it's because it has  happened so many times.  And I'm sick of it. The latest instance stems from a Sept. 28 broadcast of the Rush Limbaugh radio show.  While speaking with a caller about media interviews with soldiers, the caller stated "[the media] never talk to real soldiers. They like to pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and talk to the media" to which Limbaugh replied "the phony soldiers."

 Limbaugh's comment can be interpreted in many ways.  The most vocal critics claim that he was referring to soldiers who believe in ending the Iraq War as "phony."

 Limbaugh's interpretation is different. 

 According to Limbaugh, he was referring specifically to Jesse Macbeth, a man who claimed to be an Army Ranger in 2006 when he gained media attention for telling about atrocities that his unit committed in Iraq.  Macbeth, however, never actually served in Iraq; he was actually discharged from the service before completing basic training. 

 He is, literally, a "phony soldier," and  Limbaugh did mention Macbeth during the same phone call during which the "phony soldiers" comment was made. 

 Less than a month ago, the political action group MoveOn.org bought a full-page ad in the New York Times which read "General Petraeus or General Betrayus?"  It was an attack at the military general in Iraq. The ad garnered criticism among those who thought it to be a cheap shot at a lifelong military man.  A similar lengthy national discourse ensued in which everybody possible felt the need to share their opinion on this ad.

 Earlier this year, talk radio host Don Imus lost his job after referring to the Rutgers women's basketball team as "nappy headed hoes."  One could not turn on the radio for a month without hearing the phrase being discussed.

 The interesting thing about these occurrences is the amount of hypocrisy involved.

 The same conservatives who lambasted the "Gen. Betrayus" ad for attacking military service also, during the 2004 election, launched a campaign by a group called "Swiftboat Veterans for Truth" which attacked Senator John Kerry's military service.  The campaign was so damaging to Kerry's image that the term "swiftboated" is now defined on urbandictionary.com as a verb meaning "to be unfairly and inaccurately attacked relentlessly in the media."

 Even Limbaugh, who now finds himself defending his words, has taken part in bashing those who agree with him.  Even though he called the "Gen. Betrayus" ad "contemptable" he had no problem turning around and calling Senator Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam Veteran "Senator Betrayus" 

 In 1954, Joseph Welch asked of then-Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was responsible for ruining countless reputations by accusing opponents of being communists "Have you no sense of decency, sir?" 

 This quote is often used in political rhetoric today when one person finds another's comments despicable.  However, the person offended by the indecency has often in the past been quite lacking in decency themselves.

 So I beg, please, let's all show some decency and not get so wrapped up in sound bytes and make a big fuss over nothing. 

 It's distracting us from the issues.

Headline: Editorial: FIU mixing up financial priorities
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The struggle for name recognition is among one of the greatest hurdles any young university must overcome. In an audacious attempt to bring FIU to the forefront of the nation's public universities, President Modesto A. Maidique treaded a path many other universities have traveled in the past. He sought to forge an athletics program that would attract top-caliber athletes, while creating a degree of prestige and student pride. 

While his intentions were benevolent, the allegations that have recently surfaced have threatened to tarnish fledgling FIU Athletics Program.

According to an NCAA memorandum sent to Maidique, the infractions in question took place during the 2003-04 through 2006-07 academic years. They included violations of NCAA mandates requiring athletes to be full-time students; the five-year rule, which prevents athletes who have been enrolled in the University more than five years from participating in sports. 

In addition, violations of the progress-toward-degree requirements, which specify the amount of credits a student should have completed prior to being allowed to participate in sports were reported. The NCAA has determined that 40 student-athletes competed while academically ineligible.

The violations signal an alarming lack of resources on behalf of FIU Athletics, which evidently did not possess the capacities to handle the transition to Division I-A in 2005. 

Even Athletics Director Pete Garcia has cited the lack of resources during the transition to Division I-A as a major determinant of the shortcomings highlighted in the NCAA memorandum. "The problem is that FIU lacked the resources, manpower and adequate personnel," Garcia told The Beacon in a recent interview.

Under previous Athletics Director Rick Mello, Athletics was equipped with merely a single  NCAA compliance officer, to oversee whether or not the NCAA regulations were being adhered to and implemented in the day-to-day operations of the program. Most well established Division I-A programs have three or more compliance officers.

 Garcia has remedied this to an extent by hiring three additional compliance officers. In lieu of this situation, questions of efficiency may lead to speculation as to whether this is enough for a program with such a large amount of funds being allocated to it. 

Aside from dealing a major blow to the imminent future of the athletics program, which faces penalties to be determined next year, the infractions pose the possibility of individuals within the program who are found to have had complicity in the infractions losing their jobs. This is something very precarious for a program that saw its fair share of firings, with the departure of several different coaches in a very short time span. The athletes in question also face the potential of losing their scholarships. There is certainly good reason in suspecting whether the credibility of the program will be able to withstand the volleys of retribution that are to follow.

While other young schools are struggling to find the venues to promote their athletics programs, FIU is taking impetuous strides to expand a floundering athletics program. In spite of the budget cuts, which have caused funds to be diverted from many different aspects of University, Athletics saw its budget grow and construction on the new Golden Panther stadium commence. 

Questioning whether or not this degree of commitment to a program harboring the football team with the longest losing streak in the country is certainly justifiable. The administration should avoid squandering money on a department that has not been run efficiently and instead, make greater efforts to support departments that starved for funds and recruit top-caliber professors and researchers to enhance the reputation of the University.

Headline: Commentary: TOUGH LUCK TOWN: South Florida sports fans don't have much to root for
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Cheer up, Miami.

So the Miami Dolphins are mired in their most hopeless season in 47 years of existence.

The Miami Heat are old and broken, with Dwayne Wade out for the first few weeks of the season and its marquee free agent signing being a player that hit his prime ten years ago.

The University of Miami football team, giving up 27 points in a half en route to a loss to a lowly North Carolina Tar Heels team and  out of the Top-25 polls.

The Florida Marlins have a fairly bright future and all seven of their fans are excited.

And then you have your very own FIU, whose football team has not won a game in nearly two years and whose athletic department is being charged with breaking NCAA rules concerning ineligible players that could wreak havoc on the department for years to come.

The South Florida fan base feels hurt, upset and hopeless.

Going out to see a last place Marlins team play the Washington Nationals on an overcast and rainy Wednesday afternoon is about as exciting as it sounds, which explains why there were just over 300 people at that game near the end of the season.

Still, all the complaining may be slightly unjustified when one remembers the success this city has had and the failure other ones have had for an almost unimaginable time.

As far ago as it seems, the Florida Marlins have won two World Series in the past ten years. 

It's taken the Boston Red Sox, the most supported and revered team in baseball (yes, even more than the New York Yankees), 86 years to do the same thing. 

Should the Yankees not win the championship next season it will be almost ten years since they have won, with a 195 million dollar payroll and all.

Sure, the Heat also give cause for concern. 

They are one year older, have no small forward, are questionable at point guard and will be led in the beginning of the season by a distracted Shaquille O'Neal who is in the midst of an ugly divorce. 

But you can be glad you aren't an Atlanta Hawks fan, who haven't made the playoffs since 1999 and have yet to make it to the conference finals, let alone the NBA championship, since moving to Atlanta in 1968.

	Ironically enough, the Miami Dolphins, the most beloved franchise in south Florida, have not won a championship since 1973, which is so long ago that it is irrelevant to nearly anybody reading this newspaper. 

The support is still strong and is always a hot topic in the press and on the airwaves.

Fortunate enough for them no matter how bad they try to be they maintain the backing of their faithful.

For the record, Philadelphia has not had a championship since 1983 in any of the four major sports and their fans are so bitter that they booed Santa Clause at an Eagles game once.

Meanwhile, Cleveland has not won a championship in football since 1964, in baseball since 1948 and never in basketball. San Diego's teams have never won anything.

These may be rough times. It is understandable that you, the fan, does not want to give your hard earned dollars or, even more importantly, your time to an organization that doesn't provide what you are looking for. 

But next time you are ready to wave the white flag and start looking for a new team, remember what attracted us to follow something that seems so trivial to an outsider.

It is the feeling of success upon victory; the feeling that makes you hug a complete stranger sitting next to you in the stands. 

That feeling that gives you a inexplicable connection these millionaire athletes who have no idea who you are. 

This feeling is only amplified a thousand times over when you have been with a team through those tough times when all hope seemed lost. 

Ask any Red Sox fan what the greatest moment in their life is and don't be surprised when they say the night of Oct. 24, 2004. 

It is the release of all those years of questioning decisions and angrily shouting at the TV. 

It is the satisfaction derived from knowing you weren't wrong in following a team all those years. 

It is why we remain faithful to our teams through thick and thin, because through all the suffering it makes the inevitable success greater. 

In the end, it's all the more rewarding.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Freshman scores two goals as team ends losing streak
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The inability to put the ball in the net had been the story of the men's soccer team this season. The lack of offense was the main reason the team had failed to pick up a victory through their first 10 games.

With just 6 goals in those 10 games, the offense had been the team's most obvious weakness.

The team's outlook was especially bleak after falling behind 2-1 to Central Florida in the 68th minute Oct. 10 at University Park.

However, the Golden Panthers (1-8-2, 1-2-0 Conference USA) bounced back and put up 2 goals in the final 22 minutes of the game, including from freshman Steven Jair Cabas who put up a goal earlier in the game as well, to give the team its first victory of the season.

The 3-2 FIU win drops UCF's record to 4-7-1 overall and 0-2-1 in Conference USA.

The Knights struck first in the 15th minute with a goal from Ryan Roushandel, whose low shot from outside the box snuck past junior goalkeeper Kyle Thomas to give UCF an early 1-0 lead.

The Golden Panthers fought back and almost tied the game in the 24th minute when senior midfielder Richard Martinez took a shot from 10 yards out that was turned away by UCF goalkeeper Sean Johnson. 

FIU finally got on the board just before the end of the first half as Cabas launched a free kick from outside of the box that found it's way into the back of the net for his second goal of his season.

The Golden Panthers came out fighting in the second half and nearly took the lead when senior defender Ainsley Deer worked his way behind the UCF defense before his shot went wide of the net. 

FIU missed another great shot to take the lead when sophomore forward Christian Caporaletti received a header opportunity from senior midfielder Edgard Correa but had the shot sail wide.

It appeared as though these missed opportunities would come back to haunt FIU. 

In the 68th minute, Roushandel would take advantage of a mistake by Kyle Thomas and put the Knights ahead with his second goal of the game.

But the Golden Panthers refused to go away. 

Just over a minute after the Knights took back the lead, Caporaletti struck back with his first goal of the season when he scored off a rebound following two saves from UCF's Johnson.

Caporaletti nearly put the Golden Panthers up for good in the 72nd minute as he received another header, but was denied by the  Johnson, who recorded his fifth and final save in the match. 

In the 85th minute, Caporaletti was again in the middle of the action, as he worked his way through the UCF defense before falling down. 

While he was fighting for the ball on the ground, Cabas took control of the ball and found the back of the net for his second goal of the game, the eventual game winner. 

The win marked first of head coach Munga Eketebi's career. 

The team will next take on Alabama-Birmingham on the road Oct. 13.

Headline: Commentary: TOUGH LUCK TOWN: Women's soccer faces cross-town rival UM in midweek home contest
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Anytime UM and FIU face off, images of crutches and helmets enter my head. 

More importantly, it's during these games that I see the most fans yelling and cheering on FIU.

The Golden Panthers women's soccer squad plays against the Miami Hurricanes Oct. 17 at University Park.

As of Oct. 12, the Golden Panthers are amidst a four-game losing streak that began when their record was 2-2 and their season showed some promise. Despite FIU's record, UM is not just another opponent on the schedule. Even if this game decided the fate of FIU's season, the intensity level would be the same.

Bragging rights for one year is reason enough for the Golden Panthers to treat this contest as if it were a championship game. 

And it will be a difficult game for the Golden Panthers as the Hurricanes have measured up against the top teams in the country. 

UM is coming off a 1-0 victory against No. 4 Boston College, giving the Eagles their first loss of the season.

The Hurricanes' defense will give FIU problems scoring because of goalkeeper Lauren McAdam, who tied the team record with 13 career shut outs after the BC win. The Hurricanes' defenders will add more pressure to the Golden Panthers' offense as well. 

Their physical style of play will disrupt the Golden Panthers' offensive flow. 

The Hurricanes' squad possesses taller players that will look to bully the smaller Golden Panther forwards and midfielders.  

Freshman forward Claudia Cardenas is the Golden Panthers' number one option on offense. Although she is not the fastest player on the team, she is the best finisher. She can expect double teams and hard tackles to wear her down and break her confidence. 

On the opposite side, another freshman leads the Canes on offense. Brittney Steinbruch has scored 12 goals in 13 games this season. 

Her ability to break free from defenders allows her to have numerous scoring chances. Steinbruch has recorded 77 total shots and 32 shots on goals compared to the entire FIU team that has a total 52 shots on goal.

They will have to limit the Hurricanes' scoring chances because the FIU offense has hit a rut in recent games.

The team's thin roster is beginning to affect the Golden Panthers. This season, coach Thomas Chestnutt has been trying to manage and preserve his team, but fatigue is catching up with the club.

FIU has been playing several games of catch up in their recent losses. Opponents have scored early to open Pandora's Box of goals. If the Golden Panthers is down early against UM, they will not be able to recover. 

They need to play a close, low-scoring game to have a chance against UM.

Only five games remain in the season and this season will serve as learning tool for next year's squad. Whether FIU reaches the Sun Belt Conference Championship or not, this game will gauge the team's resiliency and potential.

Perhaps the Golden Panthers' fans will give the team a much needed boost of confidence. And not only for the game against UM, but for the remainder of the 2007 season.

Headline: Japan fans invite others to join club
Author: Amanda Massa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Peeking into the excitement of popular culture, discovering the display of art and beauty in film and dissecting the intricacies of the Ramen noodle phenomenon have all been neatly bundled into the bimonthly meetings of the Japan Club.

"The topics are so versatile and you will be left wondering what you are going to talk about next time," said Emily Hutchinson, an assistant in the Asian Studies Department.

The club offers individuals interested in Japan a place to talk about the country.

"Some of the ideas presented in the Japan Club are easier to grasp if you are into Japan and its culture," Hutchinson said. "But there are so many things that are surprising if you don't know anything." 

Hutchinson saidthat one of her favorite topics covered in the meetings are Japanese films and their relation to the culture. 

Some of the films they watch deals with women's fashions, vampires, monsters and as Hutchinson says, "naughty Japan."

Juanna Garcia, a senior majoring in Asian studies, said that there are other benefits to being a member of the Japan club besides learning about the country.. 

"We do a lot of things outside of school and it is one of the best ways to network with other people," Garcia said.

The outside events usually focus on cultural activities according to Michelle Holtkamp, the Japan Club president. 

"For the most part, we focus on present-day cultural activities which range anywhere from food to host clubs," Holtkamp said.

Host clubs are caf&eacute;'s in Japan where women pay to flirt with the men who serve them. This type of caf&eacute; hit FIU last year when the Anything Goes Anime Film Club featured a show about host clubs. Despite the popularity of Japanese cartoons, the Japan club tries not to focus on them.

"We try to distinguish ourselves from Anything Goes Anime since there are so many interesting aspects of Japanese culture that are worth studying and discussing," Holtkamp said. 

Holtkamp took over leadership of the Japan Club when its previous officers all graduated.

"I wanted to see the club continue because I had so much fun the year before," Holtkamp said. 

The club will be celebrating their second-annual Halloween social Oct. 26 at 6 p.m. in the Panther Suite in the Graham Center. 

"We do it mainly for the Japanese exchange students to give them a taste of Halloween because they don't technically celebrate it there," Holtkamp said. 

The party will be free and open to the public.

Aside from social events and meetings, the Japan club also offers tutoring sessions for those interested in learning Japanese.

"In class you learn textbook Japanese, which most people do not always speak," Holtkamp said. "A lot of us are Asian studies majors and we learn about [Japanese] history in class, but then in the Japan club you get to supplement that with pop culture and other fun stuff they won't teach you in class."

Headline: Pip Brant: Political art displayed at Frost Museum
Author: Jessica Ariste / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Artists often use art to make political and social statements but Pip Brant's pieces like the Bush 'W'oodoo Parlor, which allowed viewers to pin curses and blessings to a Bush look-alike voodoo doll, differentiates her from the rest. 

FIU's Frost Art Museum opened its doors for the displayed art Oct. 12 in the Pip Brant: The Flying Carpet and Other Reusables exhibit. 

"The depiction of public tragedy on these domestic pieces of cloth, once used to shelter a piece of furniture used to feed a basic human clan, is converted into a narrative that seeks to relocate states of social disarray," Brant says on her Web site.

Brant's work has been described as straightforward and truthful. She portrays the things that anger her but uses mockery and wit.

"She uses technical skill of embroidery or sewing to create very contemporary pieces that don't fall under crafts," said Anna Scharnagl, a junior at FIU.

Brant's art includes fiber-based, dyed and embroidered tablecloths as well as weavings she has converted into social and political statements. She portrays her feelings of current issues in her art.

"Old tablecloths and exhausted carpets become time capsules for the absurd ways in which communities face compromising issues," said Brant to the Miami Art Museum.

By this Brant explains that she uses these objects, like weavings and tablecloths to show the terrible things that are happening in the world.

The exhibition consists of pieces she has worked on over the last three years and will include two large-scale interactive installations that have been deemed controversial.

One of these is a Persian rug with a map of Iraq and the word spelled out with little guns. 

This rug moves and is on the chassis of an American truck. It represents how the United States barged into Iraq because of the quest for oil.

"The flying carpet is a lesson in geography and then goes from there with meanings in both the imagery and materials," Brant said. 

The other is a cage-like giant veil entitled "Blood Veil" made out of doilies "women would have used to decorate their home and referring to the veils Arab women are forced to wear,"  said Susan Thomas, membership coordinator of the Frost Art Museum.

Previous exhibitions have varied including one with paintings that connected to her recollections of her upbringing on the Western Plains Indian reservations where her family was employed. 

She also had an exposition where she showed a series of vintage tablecloths that reflected her feeling on things like the Iraq war.

In her Tabled Reports: Natural Disasters and Other Stories her art presented some of her fears like Mad Cow Disease, SARS and Avian Flu. 

She also used the hurricanes that were so often hitting Florida as one of her main subjects for that exhibit.

In this exhibition "Pip is using clothes and objects that would [usually describe] family life and dyed over them, talking about what is happening in the world today while we are talking in the dinner table," Thomas said.

Her work portrays images of natural disasters, war, death and many other current issues and yet these images come from things like weavings and tablecloths that have usually been associated with femininity and peace. 

"Working with found fibers (doilies, rugs or table cloths) adds an additional layer of meaning and history," Brant said.

Some of her pieces are currently in museums in Wyoming and Florida but her art has been showcased both nationally and internationally including places like Kaunas, Lithuania, Belfast, Ireland and England

Pip Brant, a faculty member of FIU's College of Architecture and the Arts won the Florida Cultural Consortium fellowship in the media and visual arts in 2003, an award that recognizes artists who meet certain criteria like establishing a recognized body of original works following a discipline over certain period of time. 

The exhibition will be open to the public Oct 12 - Dec. 9. 

For more information about the exhibit visit www.frostartmuseum.org or visit Brant's Web site at www.pipbrant.com.

"I am hoping that the audience can play with the interactive installations and ponder what the issues these pieces address," said Brant.

Headline: Wall Street preps future millionares
Author: Vanessa Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sponsors for Educational Opportunity is holding an informational meeting at the University Park campus Oct. 16 for its summer finance internships in New York. 

Students who are accepted will be placed in a 10-week internship in a company in the financial district.

At the meeting, interested students will have the chance to interact with program recruiters and alumni who will provide them with tips for interviewing and getting into the program.  There will also be opportunities for one-on-one question sessions, resume critiques and mock interviews.  

"We look for people that are actively involved in the community and have a strong academic background," said Sari David, senior program coordinator and SEO Florida recruiter. " [The internship is for those] who want the opportunity to go through an intense and exciting internship program that will hopefully lead to a full-time job in New York."

SEO's goal is to diversify Wall Street by serving as the middle-man for a total of 4,000 Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian and Native American students.  Furthermore, SEO provides its interns with mentors and exposes to them to the CEOs and top executives from prominent firms in the industry.  

FIU has had a total of five students go through it; two are still active within the organization.  

"It's a very great internship," said FIU senior Daniel Diago, who completed his internship with Merryl Lynch through SEO this past summer. "They expected a lot from me, but when you're around people that have such ambition, it really encourages you to do the same."

The organization, which started off as a mentoring and college prep program for underprivileged high school students in 1963, began offering its career program in 1980 with the purpose of exposing highly successful students of color to paid internships within the nation's most challenging fields.

FIU senior Adriana Rodriguez, who will graduate next Spring semester, serves as the vivid example of SEO intern success. 

Shortly after returning home from her internship in New York, Rodriguez got offered a part-time position as a financial analyst in the Wall Street financial firm, JPMorgan Chase & Co. in downtown Miami. 

The meeting will take place Oct. 16 at 8 p.m. in the Graham Center 150.

FIU colleges of law and business rank high in Princeton Review 

FIU's College of Law and College of Business Administration ranked among the best in a Princeton Review report released this week. 

For the first time, the College of Business has been included in "The Best 290 Business Schools for 2008."

For the second year in a row, FIU's College of Law appeared in the review's "Best 170 Law Schools."

"These rankings are reflective of what we firmly believe we offer at FIU: a high-quality education at a great price in one of the most dynamic environments anywhere in the nation," said Provost Ronald Berkman.

The College of Business ranked number four in Princeton Review's Top 10 rankings of Greatest Opportunity for Minority Students. 

The College of Law ranked second for the diversity of its faculty and fourth best environment for minorities. 

"I am gratified that the Princeton Review has recognized our achievement in creating an attractive atmosphere for a diverse faculty and student body," said FIU College of Law Dean Leonard Strickman.

Ranking data was compiled over the past three years through surveys of hundreds of law and business school students and faculty members. 

The 80-question survey asks students about their school's academics, student body and campus life, themselves, and their career plans.  

The Princeton Review talked to 18,000 students attending the 170 law schools and 19,000 students attending the 290 business schools around the country.
