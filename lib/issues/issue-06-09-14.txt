Headline: Men's soccer earns first victory of 2006 season against Mercer
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team seems allergic to winning. 

Shut-out in three games and forced into overtime in its fourth, FIU was still searching for a win as the team faced Mercer on Sept. 10.

Thanks to two forwards finally connecting the ball with the net, the Golden Panthers (1-2-2) got that elusive 'W' in a 2-1 victory over the Bears.

"I'm one of the seniors in a line with younger players, so it felt good to get a win and get some of the pressure off my shoulders," Team Captain David Hope said. 

Hope gave FIU a 1-0 lead when he beat goalkeeper Roberto Cronenbold 10 minutes into the match. 

Cronenbold hesitantly challenged Hope, who inched past a defender and shot the ball into the bottom right corner of the goal. 

Freshman Christian Caporaletti then made it 2-0 early in the 29th minute. Cronenbold made an acrobatic save, but didn't secure the ball, and Caporaletti tapped in the rebound from six yards out before the goalkeeper could recover.

Despite the win, FIU's performance troubled Head Coach Karl Kremser. 

"Early on we played very well and put good pressure on them," Kremser said. "Then it seemed like [players] just said, 'let's take it easy,' and it turned into a free-for-all."

FIU held Mercer to three shots in the first half but the Bears earned nine shots in the second half. 

The most devastating shot came from Vicente Arze in the 67th minute. 

Moments after goalkeeper Shawn Crowe called for FIU to show heart, Arze outmaneuvered midfielder Richard Martinez near the left side of the penalty area. 

He dribbled into the box and sent a low shot past Crowe, setting the score at 2-1.

"One of the most inexcusable things in soccer is a backdoor goal and we had that happen today," Kremser said. "We cannot afford to do that because it's a basic, fundamental thing."



FIU 2, BINGHAMTON 2



It may have taken 318 minutes and a transfer student from Iceland but FIU finally earned a goal this season.

Junior midfielder Dadi Kristjánsson scored in a 2-2 tie against Binghamton Sept. 8 to end a three-game drought. 

In the 48th minute, Kristjánsson pounced on a deflected ball inside the penalty area and sent it rolling into the left side of the net.

"I was in the right place at the right time," he said "It came straight at me and I just hit it because there was nothing else to do."

Kristjánsson's goal evened the score at 1-1 but FIU couldn't celebrate long. 

Having already scored on a penalty kick in the 14th minute, Binghamton once again benefited from a handball foul in the 50th minute. 

Just as forward Barry Neville did in the first half, Peter Sgueglia blasted his penalty kick into the right side of the goal.

"It's the referee's call but I don't think either [foul] was intentional," Kremser said. "And the second one took a lot out of us because we had just scored and tied it up."

FIU answered back when forward Levi Coleman surprised the Binghamton defense in the 86th minute. 

Coleman soared over a Bearcat defender and headed in a pass from Hope that bounced off the crossbar, onto the field and into the goal.

It was Coleman's first goal of the season and a pressure-reliever for the sophomore. 

"I'm kind of frustrated - embarrassed in a way - because I feel the burden to score goals," he said. "I'm not finding the net right now but this is a start."

FIU's next match takes place Sept. 13 as the team faces rival Florida Atlantic at the University Park campus.

Headline: Football: Progress despite losses
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Twenty points. That's what Las Vegas thought FIU was going to lose by when they suited up to play the University of South Florida Bulls at Raymond James Stadium. Twenty points!

That means it wasn't even suppose to be a game, it was suppose to be a blow out.

Suprisingly, there they were, up 20-7 at halftime.

For those of you who watched or listened to the game, FIU blew the lead and a chance to score their first upset victory of the year. And not just any upset, but a victory against a Big East conference opponent who played in the Meineke Car Care Bowl last year.

They weren't the only Sun-Belt team trying to pull a fast one. Troy almost beat Florida State in Tallahassee and were also leading in the fourth quarter.

It just goes to show you that both these teams, and many other teams in smaller conferences, aren't quite ready to take down the big boys - not yet though.

Call me an optimist, but I think this should be something to build upon.

Unfortunately, I'm alone in thinking this way. All I hear around campus is how bad the team is, how they blew it, what if, etc. 

So maybe FIU would have won the game if sophomore running back Julian Reams wouldn't have fumbled the ball at their 30-yard line with 2:52 left in the game; or maybe they would have won the game if place kicker Chris Patullo would have made his first extra point. All of that shouldn't be the main issue here. It's all about progress.

And that's what I saw: a USF team that was only one point and one kick better than FIU. The same could be said for the game against Middle Tennessee, who  lost to Maryland 24-10. FIU plays Maryland Sept. 23.

The defense held the Bulls in check most of the game and the offense is beginning to find its rhythm and establish an identity.

You can't expect a five-year-old team to go undefeated in their second year in Division I-A.

Don Strock and his coaching staff are slowly trying to build a program and tradition at FIU. And with that, growing pains and patience should be expected.

Unfortunately, patience isn't something found in sports today; coaches are fired left and right, players are cut and fans cry for blood when a team goes 9-3, instead of 12-0.

During his first year at FSU, Bobby Bowden went 5-6 and now he holds the NCAA record for coaching victories. 

So a few losses this year shouldn't surprise anyone.

It hasn't surprised oddsmakers in Las Vegas because Bowling Green is favored to defeat FIU by five points. Is it finally time to pick the underdog?

Headline: Golden Panthers lose by one point again
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
TAMPA, Fla.-For the second week in a row FIU's defense played their hearts out. Also for the second week in a row, a lackluster offense and a missed extra point cost the Golden Panthers the game. 

FIU (0-2, 0-1) dropped their second game in nine days on the road as they visited University of South Florida (2-0) in Tampa's Raymond James Stadium falling 21-20 on a late Bulls touchdown with just 2:33 left to play in regulation. 

Coach Don Strock's men looked to have sealed the biggest win in the program's short five-year history as they lead 20-13 with 2:52 to go and the ball in their hands. Sophomore running back Julian Reams fumbled on the Golden Panther 30-yard line and from there Bulls quarterback Matt Grothe took over. 

On a night that saw Grothe start his first career game, the first-year freshman completed 15-of-28 passes for 174 yards and a very important late touchdown. Grothe connected down the sideline with Taurus Johnson for a 29-yard score, his second of the day. 

"We had opportunities without a doubt, and it's a shame," Strock said. "We just didn't make plays when we had a chance to."

Before that point it seemed as though everything was falling in FIU's favor. 

FIU, a 22-point underdog by the odds makers, took a surprise lead that stunned the crowd of 27,114 people when senior wideout Chandler Williams returned a punt for an 82-yard touchdown less than five minutes into the game.  

Everything looked to be in going their way until senior first year kicker Chris Patullo missed his second extra point in two weeks. Still early in the game it appeared as though the mistake that cost the team the one point loss against Middle Tennessee would be one they could overcome. Led by strong safety Chris Smith's seven tackles, FIU's defense played a stellar first half but could only see their lead disappear from the sidelines as USF punt returner Ean Randolph broke free of the special teams unit and returned the favor with a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown. After a successful conversion, USF led 7-6 - an ominous score for Golden Panther fans so far this season. 

"Our special teams didn't do much of anything," Strock said. "We have a lot of young guys-almost all freshmen who haven't played on the punt team-and they didn't stand up to the challenge real well. That stuff you work on everyday, so that's disheartening because I am trying to get these young guys into the game and get them some experience and I wouldn't call that experience."

Before long Strock's defense stepped up and turned the second quarter around. Free safety Robert Mitchell read Grothe perfectly and stepped in front of the pass and scored on a 14-yard interception return. Patullo connected for his first career extra point giving the Golden Panthers a 13-7 lead with 9:21 to play in the half. 

FIU's offense struggled visibly throughout the night. With a brand new offensive line, the Golden Panthers combined for just 50 yards rushing on 31 attempts. 

They scored just their second touchdown of the season with 20 seconds to play in the half thanks to a USF mental blunder with 4:12 to play. 

USF returned an FIU punt all the way back for a score, only to be called back for three penalties, which gave FIU a new first down to the visitors. 

Senior quarterback Josh Padrick, who finished the night 20- of -33 for 238 yards and a touchdown, connected on 4-of-4 passes and marched FIU down the field before finding senior tight end Samuel Smith from three yards out for a touchdown and a 20-7 halftime lead.

The lead quickly dwindled as the third quarter got underway.

On just the third drive of the second half USF cut the lead to six, 20-14 as Taurus Johnson, who seemed to be wrapped up for a six-yard loss at the FIU 20-yard line, broke free of defensive end Antwan Barnes and beat three other Golden Panthers en route to a 14-yard touchdown run. 

With its opening drive of the second half,  FIU tried to possibly seal the win as they found themselves on the USF 20 yard line. 

However, with little confidence in their kicker, the Golden Panthers chose to go for it on fourth down, only to have Padrick's quarterback keeper stopped short of the first down marker.

"Offensively we moved the ball but we couldn't get six inches," Strock said. "The offensive line had a tough day. They have a lot of work to do and we understand that ... It's a work in progress, lets put it that way."

With 10:33 left to play Grothe was intercepted for the second time on the night, this time by FIU defensive back Lionell Singleton on a miss run route following an audible call at the line of scrimmage. 

FIU managed to achieve a first down with under eight minutes to play as Padrick found freshman receiver Ashlyn Parker for a 27-yard gain out to the USF 46-yard line. From there however the failing running game cost FIU as they were unable to get anything else and were forced to punt with 6:12 to play. 

With a chance at the win, Grothe drove his men down to the FIU 30 yard line where they were unable to pick up a first down with 3:46 to play. At that point, the victory seemed to be in the books,  but less than a minute later Reams would cough the ball up. 

FIU's season continues Sept. 16 at 6p.m. in its home opener at FIU Stadium against Bowling Green.

I understand the importance of the bell [at the University Park campus]. It goes off on the hour, every hour, and I think that's nice. However, after the tenth dong, it's pretty much understood that a new hour has come upon us. 

For some reason, somebody has brought it upon himself to make the most horrible music out of these bells, which lasts for another four or so minutes. This is only my third week here and I find it beyond irritating already.

Author: Rusol Yasin / Senior / Biochemistry Finance Major
&nbsp;
The "On the Right" opinion article written by Christopher Necuze for the September 11, 2006 edition of The Beacon is adorably naive. His big point, the one that knocks the wind out of any question raised against the Bush Administration, is that all terrorist attacks on American soil have ceased since September 11, 2001. Then, his point is highlighted with a tender "Game Over." Pow! Just adorable.

After reading Necuze's article, I have begun questioning where I was during the unsafe Clinton years, before George W. was elected, making America safe again. A plausible, almost worthy, argument to Necuze's statement is that there had never been any attacks on the continental American soil until 9/11/2001 when his beloved #43 had been in office for one year, taking naps in the afternoons and spending a record time on vacation at his Texas ranch. 

Also, the arrests made a few weeks ago were made by British, not American, officials. 

Let's stop gracing the Bush Administration with so much undue credit. There were, in fact, 42 presidents before him; I think some of the others may have contributed to the security and morale of this nation.

Subheadline: New bus company off to bad start
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Throughout the course of the past year, FIU has hopped from bus company to bus company in search of someone to provide transportation for the shuttle service that runs to and from the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. In four months, the University has gone through three different companies. 

Two weeks into the Summer A semester, 7871 Buslines, Inc. dissolved its contract with the University.

Desperate to find someone to supply transportation throughout the summer and until it could find a suitable replacement, the University scrapped together a contract with Royal Limousine. As The Beacon reported over the summer, this proved to be a disastrous arrangement. 

 Royal's buses were small and in poor condition. This resulted in cramped seating arrangements and water leaks, among other issues. These problems were aggravated by buses that arrived late or sometimes not at all.

The beginning of the Fall semester coincided with the start of a new contract with another bus company, American Coach. So far, the transition has been anything but smooth. 

American Coach has failed in running its buses on time. On good days, lateness has been caused by buses leaving past their scheduled departure time. In one case, this was caused because the driver wanted to finish the sandwich she was eating before getting on the road. Other times, buses have simply not shown up at all. When students rely on this essential service to get to their classes, all this translates into tardiness and absences. 

Given that FIU is not organized into two separate, wholly independent campuses, but rather as one campus spread over two locations, adequate transportation between UP and BBC is indispensable. Many students need to take classes at both campuses. Because housing at UP is in short supply, students who take classes at UP have been housed at BBC. These students need a reliable means to get from one campus to the other. 

The need for a reliable mode of transportation between campuses is essential, yet so far the University has dealt with it only as an afterthought.

For FIU's "one campus" concept to work, the administration needs to take seriously transportation between campuses. 

The administration must take action to turn the Panther Express into an efficient and reliable bus service. This means finding a bus company that is willing and prepared to meet the needs of the University and its students. Finally, it also means that once such a company is found, it must be held to its commitment to the University, rather than shuffling through a series of second-rate providers.

Headline: Democrats will win midterms
Author: Chris Cabral / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the midterm elections approaching, the Democratic Party finds itself poised to gain control of Congress. 

This opportunity is born not of superior political maneuvering on their part, but rather from the utter failure of their opponents, whose so-called "leadership" pulled us toward domestic disaster and whose vision failed to foresee catastrophe in Iraq. 

America's growing contempt for the Republicans is more than just a momentary shift of public opinion. It is a historic rebuke and rejection of the policies of extreme conservatism.

 The rise of the Republican dynasty was hailed by its proponents as the dawn of a new American order: Their work to end regulation and cede control of our economic destiny to big business would yield a new era of prosperity; their slashing of social programs would usher in a golden age of personal responsibility; and the war in Iraq would be quick and relatively easy. 

This heartwarming fantasy nearly lulled us all to sleep, comforted by visions of a secure America, protected by the benevolence of major corporations and sheltered by the warm embrace of moralists who knew what was best.

Then we awoke one morning to find our government had grown too small, so small as to be rendered impotent, lost in the hands of people who disdained the institution of government itself. 

No longer checked by regulation or government intervention, the oil, health care and insurance industries could now milk consumers for record profits. Disaster struck the Gulf Coast and our leaders seemed paralyzed by indecision and apathy. As wages remained stagnant, Congress remained too fearful of interfering with the "free" market to raise the minimum wage, so instead they busied themselves with talk of banning gay marriage. 

Our troops came to realize that while the G.O.P. supports them in spirit, it would not hesitate to give them inadequate body armor and gut veterans' benefits. Voters have found themselves buried by an avalanche of broken promises.  A change in leadership has seldom looked more appealing. 

This election is about more than a change of parties; it's about a change of philosophy. Either we can take action as a nation to lift wages, help the poor, regulate profiteers and weigh new options in Iraq, or we can continue to cede control to people who would rather obey their fearless leader than serve their constituents.

Some say they would rather "stay the course." But "stay the course" implies that we've actually been going somewhere. This country is adrift, with no sense of direction or purpose. 

A  Democratic Congress will work to raise the minimum wage, expand access to health care and change policy in Iraq. A new direction is needed, and only new leadership can initiate it.

Some people believe that we cannot do any better. They see no hope for the millions who toil for low pay and lack health care. They see no hope for consumers ravaged by the greed of corporations. 

But this country can do great things. It has overcome greater problems before. Social Security, overtime pay, Medicare. These programs and reforms are monuments to what can be achieved through a government dedicated to serving its people. 

All we need are leaders who acknowledge these problems exist, and work to solve them. Electing a Democratic Congress may not be a cure-all for the nation's ills, but it will be a step forward for a country that has been in regression for too long.

Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Amid the crowds and bustle of the greek rush week, the administration of the Graham University Center organized a memorial service for the victims of the terrorist attacks that took place on Sept. 11, 2001 and for those currently in service.

The commemorative ceremony began at 8:30 a.m. with a Color Guard ceremony performed by the University ROTC and the National Guard 

Student Union Chairman Michael Jadoo  addressed a group of 50 students, faculty and staff at 12:30 p.m. about the significance of the day in American history.

"I thought the event went very well, despite rush hour and the activities going on at the Graham Center," said Jadoo.

Rabbi Levi Friedman, director and rabbi of the Chabad Student Center at FIU, delivered a speech on the importance of peace in the world.

"9/11 was a day that saw man at his worst and at his best," Friedman said. "Today, five years later, we've got to ask ourselves what we can take from that day. 

The lesson is to do something positive - To do a good deed. There is a lot of darkness in the world. We cannot banish the darkness with a stick. It has to be banished with the light."

To honor the victims of 9/11, Friedman performed a short piece on the Shofar, a musical instrument that is used in Judaism on the holy days of Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. 

Students from the Multi-faith Council also offered prayers in remembrance.

Maj. Wally Gallart, assistant professor of Military Sciences, who took part in the half-mast ceremony, thought the memorial was very well organized and heartfelt. 

"It was marked with a lot of dignity," Gallart said. "It was something to look for the good in people and a way to learn about the good things in life."

Senior Gabriel Perez, a member of the Catholic Student Union, was also appreciative of the GC administration.

"It was an event of love and respect," Perez said. "Also, we have to remember our faith. Our faith is very important to help the souls achieve piece." 

The event concluded with students, faculty and staff observing a moment of silence before a candlelight ceremony. Students and staff also signed the memorial on the GC Pit wall and at the Chabad Student Center table.

At the Biscayne Bay Campus, several students and staff also gathered to remember the lives lost. 

Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs Cathy Akens welcomed the group of few and BBC SGA Elections commissioner, Edgard Izaguirre read a poem he authored entitled "Behold! The Beauty of Tragedy."

As in UP, the group also had a moment of silence and a candle lighting ceremony.

Headline: Dinner raises funds for Islamic Relief charity
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
A fund raising dinner will be held in the Graham Center East Ballroom Sept. 15 at 8 p.m., to help the Lebanese and Palestinian families who have been displaced because of recent Middle East conflicts.

"The Humanitarian Crisis: Lebanon and Palestine" is the result of three organizations working together for the cause: The Muslim Student Association, the Pakistani Student Association and the Women's Studies Honor Society. The proceeds from the dinner will be given to Islamic Relief, an international charity that provides assistance for the impoverished and homeless and raises more than $50 million annually.

According to MSA President Nasim Ahmed, the idea for the dinner developed in early May at the start of the Summer A term. The sponsoring organizations collaborated and brought the idea to fruition.

"Everything just came together," said Ahmed. "The Muslim Student Association had an idea and was planning this dinner, and the Women's Studies Honors Society was extremely enthusiatic about the cause and wanted to help us out. The Pakistani Student Association offered to help as well."

Because of the amount of donations, though, the cost for putting the event together is hard to determine.

"It's really difficult to say because so many people donated things and put their effort into the event," said Ahmed. "For example, MSA put forward $200 for food, and the Pakistani Student Association is helping pay for decorations."

Aside from the FIU clubs, outside organizations are helping with the dinner to help promote awareness of the displacement problem affecting thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian people. Arabic food is being provided by Mediterranean restaurant Maroosh.

"The food is being donated by a restaurant in Coral Gables," said Pakistani Student Organizations Council Representative Beena Kazi. 

In addition, tables are available at the dinner for any person or group who wants to sell anything or pass out information about a particular cause. The cost for a table is $100. 

Besides the Arabic food being served and the information tables set up in the ballroom, there will be several speakers participating in the event. Naeem Muhammad, a representative from Islamic Relief, is the main speaker at the dinner and will be giving a presentation about the crisis in Lebanon and Palestine as well as bringing another speaker who has yet to be announced. 

"Naeem is going to do a presentation that has a purpose of hopefully motivating the guests at the dinner to donate more money for this cause," Ahmed said.

Muhammad has traveled around the world as part of Islamic Relief to raise money for children worldwide, including those affected by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. This summer, he was a part of the Evening of Inspiration tour that stopped in various states such as New Jersey and California to emphasize the organization's activities, attract volunteers and help gain new donors.

This is not the MSA's first time working with Islamic Relief.

"We worked with Islamic Relief last year for another dinner, and it worked out well," said Ahmed. "They send the money to people who really need it so we wanted to work with them again."

For the dinner, about 200 people are expected to attend and witness the presentation by Muhammad. 

"This is a pretty big event for all of us," said Ahmed. "We expect anywhere from 150 to 200 people to show up on Friday and support the cause."

The fund raising dinner is open to anyone, both students and non-students. However, students receive a discount -- admission for students is $10 while admission for the general public is $15. Babysitting will be provided.

Headline: Class notes available on the web
Author: Yesenia Forte / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
A company called Genius Notes, LLC, hires students to go to class every day and take notes that can be sold to peers so students can buy notes for their courses without ever stepping foot inside the classroom. 

"Ideally a classroom is about exchange of information and not participating in the class detracts from the experience," said Patrick Peacock, a PHD student and adjunct professor at FIU. "An important ingredient in a university education is interaction."

Peacock's American Civilization class is one of over 25 classes at FIU in which Genius Notes are available. However. he is worried this may discourage students from attending class because they can just buy the notes online.

"A class should be about oral communication and debate, it shouldn't be a professor lecturing the whole time," he said. "And a student who relies on the notes [and doesn't go to class] might be shortchanged."

Mark Adam, one of the company's founders, argues that "students that are already lazy would probably be discouraged from going to class, but the ones who are really interested in learning will go to class."

Genius Notes' services are generally offered for courses of more than 400 students, most of which are lower division courses.  

Student employees get paid a minimum of $200 per class/semester. They also can make commission on how well the notes are taken and how many students buy notes for that class.

"Maybe some people learn better if they just listen during class and then they can buy the notes to study from. Whatever works for them," said junior Jose Arias, a special education major.

Peacock agrees that the notes could be helpful in some applications. For example, if a student just listens and participates during class and then buys the notes as additional material to study from.

"If students are sick and have to miss class, they can buy the notes," said Adam.

 Adam, Antonio Rodriguez and Ryan Lipps, started the company in 2004.  They first set up the company at University of Florida where they are all currently enrolled as economics majors. 

Louisiana State University was their next venture, but after hurricane Katrina they had to close down.

This Fall semester, Genius Notes will be available for classes at Indiana University and FIU.

"The more options are available for students the better," said junior Valentin Beauliere.

Students can go online to their website www.GeniusNotes.com to submit an employment application or to purchase notes.

"The bus left 20 minutes late," Huntzicker said.

Two weeks into the Panther Express shuttle service with newly contracted American Coach Lines of Miami, students weren't the only ones facing problems.

"Driver's should be given orientation as to who we are as an entity. They should know who their customers are," said William Martinez, assistant director of Operations for the Wolfe University Center.

Martinez is a frequent shuttle user and suggests that the bus service has room for improvement. 

"One driver took us to the Hollywood Blvd. exit en route to BBC which shows they haven't been given a map of the best routes," Martinez said. "Some drivers have been leaving earlier than it says on the bus schedule or one will try to pack a bus to let the other driver leave early."

Transitional items like that in the first couple of weeks are normal according to Purchasing Director Stephen Millspaugh. 

"It is my experience with new contracts that after a two-week period we sit down with the vendor to see what's working out and what isn't," he said.

The morning of Sept. 8, Bill Foster, director of Parking and Transportation, made a conference call to the location manager for American Coach, Bret Brittemun, to discuss the problems that had been reported. 

"It's transportation and there's always a problem. Things happen, but it's a necessary service in order to link UP and BBC," said Foster. "We are trying to get things resolved."

FIU contracted American Coach to provide shuttle service between University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus beginning Aug. 28. 

The contract with American Coach was created for five years and will cost the University more than $500,000 a year, according to Foster.

The University will have to pay $53 per bus per hour, however, the total dollar amount will vary based on usage.

The price for students remains at $2 for a one-way ticket.

Other than the $2 per ticket charge, funding will come from monies collected from the various Parking and Traffic revenue sources, such as parking fees.

FIU previously used 7871 Buslines Inc. until the second week of the Summer A semester when the company ended its contract abruptly.

The company wanted a price increase because of rising gas prices, but their contract with FIU didn't allow that and 7871 gave notice that they were withdrawing from their contract.  

FIU negotiated with them and they came to an agreement but 7871 withdrew regardless, according to Edward Vasquez, associate director of Purchasing Services.

"I understand," Vasquez said. "If I were a businessman I would do the same. They should have built that into the contract, but who could have foreseen that two years ago." 

For a short time during the summer semester, the University used Royal Limousine Inc.

Students still complained that they felt unsafe and that the buses arrived late.

"We didn't keep Royal Limousine because they don't really have the equipment. We just needed someone in a hurry for the summer," said Vasquez. 

FIU put out a contract bid and decided to go with American Coach because they were the lowest bidder meeting specifications.

They also use the same motor coaches 7871 used. 

American Coach is run by the same people FIU used before 7871, a company that was called Coach USA. 

"We are very excited to be back with FIU and we look forward to a great five years," said Brittemun.

Headline: Hazing not a major concern among Greek organizations
Author: Jose Pagliery / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although recent hazing incidents at Florida A&M may have incoming 

students worried about such activities occurring at FIU, Danai Pestana, vice president of the Panhellenic Council, feels the need to convince them otherwise. 

"On behalf of sororities, I don't think hazing exists [at FIU]," she said. "We don't have that problem. Each chapter's headquarters would have to come down and revoke the chapter if it did." 

As VP of the council, Pestana oversees different committees, including public relations, philanthropy and athletics. She defines hazing as "anything that can break a person down," and believes that although it may not happen at FIU, other schools don't follow such strict regulations. 

"[It] definitely exists in more of the southern and traditional colleges, where the really old chapters are," she said. 

A recent incident at FAMU put five students in the spotlight after the brutal beating of a fellow Kappa Alpha Psi member during an initiation session. 

This will be the first hazing case in Florida since a state law was passed in June 2005 making hazing a third-degree felony. 

Although hazing is commonly understood as the practice of severe abuse and physical harm as a means for proving value during the initiation process, the actual term refers to almost any sort of exploitation or mistreatment. 

Humiliating behavior, such as being forced to swallow a goldfish or to walk around in the nude, could be categorized as hazing as well. 

"There are other ways of going about showing courage, brotherhood and sisterhood," said sophomore Stephanie Guedes, Risk Management coordinator for Delta Phi Epsilon. 

As of yet, FIU's slate seems to be spotless in comparison with schools like the University of Miami, University of Florida, Florida State University and FAMU.   

At FIU, every fraternity claims to abide by laws set about in the 

Interfraternity Council's Constitution, last revised in November 2004, which includes Article IV, a section dedicated solely to the laws pertaining to hazing. 

It states that "hazing means any action, activity or situation which recklessly, negligently, or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a person for the purpose of initiation or admission." Further on, it urges any person who suffers from or witnesses any hazing to "report the incident to the appropriate university officials and to the IFC Judicial Board Chair."

The National Panhellenic Council also has bylaws that pertain to hazing, characterizing it as "any morally degrading or humiliating games and activities." 

It does not, however, urge students to report such activities, although the sentiment seems to be implied. 

"It's our duty to report any hazing incidents to Greek offices, at whatever school it happens at," Guedes said. 

She, along with many other Greeks at FIU, believes that any hazing a student may encounter should be reported immediately, both for the safety of fellow students and the reputation of the university. 

On paper, FIU's records seem to contain no evidence of a hazing incident, much less one that ended in tragedy. 

However, some students still admit that the practice continues.

"I know that hazing still takes place, but I'm glad to say that we're not a part of that," said senior Reynaldo Wint, director of recruitment for Alpha Kappa Psi. "We realize the importance of development. Hazing is just a more backwards style of doing that."

Stephanie Mendy, a sophomore and sister of Alpha Xi Delta, recalled an incident with a family member. 

"In 1993, my brother-in-law was in a fraternity and they were abusing him really bad," she said. "But he contacted the National Council and they put a stop to it." 

Trying to comfort students that may still be worried about abusive activities, Mendy insisted that prospective members have a number of outlets for reporting such incidents, along with many safety nets. 

"We have a meeting during the fall term that talks about it, and they make it comfortable for a person to make the council aware of what's going on," she said. 

"Since the school's so small, it's more controlled," Mendy said. "You're joining an organization for what you get out of it, not what you do to get in."

Headline: Explicit Content...a sex and relationship column
Subheadline: Intimacy leads to enhanced enjoyment
Author: Dana A. Gruber
&nbsp;
Intimacy is a necessary facet to every sexual relationship. It is what leads up to the act of sex. There are, however, different forms and levels of intimacy, both dependent on the connection between partners and upon each person's turn-ons.

I find that the greatest sex occurs when you can connect with the other person on a spiritual level. Their pheromones, as you breathe them in, can drive you wild with desire. You play off of this person's energy and know exactly what they need. It can be as simple as caressing them behind their knee to make them shiver. 

An energetic experience can become tantric. Tantrism is rooted in Indian tradition and is a practice similar to yoga that allows us to channel energy and use it in emancipating ways.  In this situation, we could refocus our energy to have longer orgasms, multiple orgasms and also greater endurance and awareness.

Another example can be when you lust after someone on a physical level. Whether it is bulging muscles, a terrific smile, dazzling eyes, or a hot derriere, there is some reason you just cannot take your eyes off of them. There is a mutual attraction and, without even knowing much about this person's personality, you just want to rip their clothes off and watch the sweat ripple down their chiseled abs. 

Intimacy can also include foreplay. This can be kissing, touching, licking and petting. It includes things such as candle-lit massages, making seductive eye contact, whispering something sexy into their ear and even using toys.  

Some men may be intimidated by toys at first, but after they realize that it takes some of the workload off of them and makes you go wild, they will soon be down for whatever. Creativity is key!

When approaching an intimate affair, it is important to just relax and let things unfold naturally. Do not hesitate to communicate with your partner and let them know your likes and dislikes. If you spend too much time "fishing around," it may make your partner feel uncomfortable and it could hinder the experience. 

Ladies, if you like g-spot stimulation, tell him. If your clitoris needs to be rubbed at the same time, let him know. Not all women are pleased equally. And, men, if you want her to try something new, just ask - she may be open to it. 

Don't try to initiate anything unexpectedly - especially anal sex. I can assure you it will make her mad. Ease into it and she will be more responsive in telling you her needs.

To get the full experience of how great intimacy can be, plan an evening alone with your partner. Start with a romantic dinner, followed by a walk under the stars, a candle-lit bubble bath and lots of explorative kissing. Just take your time, do it right and thank me later!

Headline: From Here To There
Subheadline: Students find the shortest distance between two points isn't always the Panther Express bus route
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
As many students already know, there are two main campuses for students to attend classes: University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Located 20 miles away from each other, it's a simple matter for students to commute between the two campuses. Because the commute is particularly difficult for those without their own vehicles, FIU set up a bus service going back and forth between UP and BBC. 

However, depending on which student you ask, the bus service is either a blessing or a curse.

I myself had never ridden on the bus service before, so as an educational venture I bought the $4 round trip ticket and headed for the bus stop. 

The pouring rain I was being sheltered from under the bus stop was the first of several bad omens I would receive on this ride. 

Much to the dismay of many of the students waiting, the 8 a.m. bus never showed up. Or, if you want to look at it a different way, the 8 a.m. bus was 30 minutes late and the 8:15 a.m. bus never showed up….or was it just that the 8:15 a.m. bus showed up 15 minutes late? 

Regardless of how you look at it, two buses were scheduled to show up at 8:00 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., but only one bus arrived.  	  

Once students boarded the bus, all seemed to be going well. 

That is, until the bus turned onto 107th Ave. and stayed there for 20 minutes because of traffic. 

The bus driver obviously did not know that you could cut through FIU and turn directly onto 8th street, which is where the turnpike leading to BBC is located; it took two hours to reach BBC. Granted, a big piece of the delay was due to the rainy weather, but then again it is Miami, and it rains frequently. 

Does this sound familiar? 

According to some students, this is a regular occurrence. 

"This started in the summer. It's my second time missing class because the buses are running so late," said junior Jessica Nodarse. "I missed my class, why bother to get off?" Nodarse said when the bus arrived. 

She wasn't alone either: five other students were in the same situation as Nodarse. 

She, on the other hand, was determined to start a petition demanding that the university's previous bus service be reinstated. 

"We're paying more money for crappier service," said Nodarse. 

Not all students have such bleak opinions of the shuttle service, however. 

"It's really convenient. It saves gas, and the time is good for taking naps or eating breakfast," said Junior Amir Shahidpour while taking the bus from BBC to UP. 

When things go on schedule, students tend to enjoy themselves. 

"I either chill with friends or listen to music," said sophomore Natasha Qureshi. 

Some faculty members like Martin Quirke, professor of organic chemistry, insist that despite the bus service's drawbacks, it's a vital service. 

"I personally don't get any perks for teaching at both campuses, but it's really important to have the bus service," Quirke said. 

The wheels on the bus go round and round, side to side, and sometimes over the curb as was the case with my bus ride. 

At times, it felt as if the bus was going to tip over given how fast it was going in the pouring rain. 

"I'm glad I got here alive," Qureshi said as she left the bus.

However, this kind of driving is not exclusive to this bus service, according to student Vincent Pignatieello. 

"Last [spring] semester, my bus driver was pulled over and given a ticket by a police officer. I think it was for speeding in a residential area," Pignatieello said.   

Speaking from general experience, most bus services that provide this kind of daily service often sacrifice things like minor safety in order to stay on schedule as much as possible, hence speeding through residential areas and rain.

For many students and faculty, the bus service is a double-edged sword. 

Many pros students share about the service include: it saves on gas/tolls; gives students a carefree ride; and provides invaluable sleep/snack/study time. 

The cons that many share in common include: being late for classes; possible safety hazards; being on a bus when it breaks down and missing your classes altogether.

Whether or not you choose to ride the bus service, the simple fact is that using the shuttle service is cheaper than driving your car between both campuses. 

The real concern for students is whether or not to bring a helmet along for the ride.

Headline: Author's lecture addresses oil and corruption
Author: Fernando Anzoategui & Cristela Guerra / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Edwin Black, bestselling investigative author from the New York Times, kicked off The Middle East Society's Fall lecture series with a hot topic: oil.

It was his first of 500 stops in 30 cities in a national book tour to promote his new book, Internal Combustion,  a non-fictional novel in thick black binding about oil, corruption and the history of the Middle East. 

Seeming not the type to mince words, Black introduced himself bluntly.

"If you want to understand Middle East politics, you've got to understand oil and our dependency on it," he said.

His lecture, entitled "The explosion of Petropolitics in the  Middle East," confronted many issues such as terrorism and why the U.S. seems to rely so heavily on the petroleum it receive from the other side of the world.

Black attacked the root of the problem that according to him began centuries before using phrases such as a "century of lies based upon a millennia of manipulation" referring to the commercial oil industry. 

"It began in the cradle of civilization formerly known as Mesopotamia. I'd prefer to call it the cradle of commerce," Black said.

Black also touched on the history of foreign affairs within the Middle East from the Anglo-Persian oil company to the well-known, British Petroleum company or BP.

"There has always been oil in the Middle East,"according to Black. "Petroleum literally means the oil that comes from the rock."

An interesting perspective on the oil crisis was Black's insistence on new methods of energy and fuel.

The writer encouraged all to fax purchase orders to Honda and demand they produce more cars that run on compressed natural gas or alternative energy.

"We need to get off oil today, not be one imposed upon when we least expect it.  The car companies have sold us out," Black said.

Many in the audience, even those who arrived a bit late, felt the impact of his words.

"I heard about it in class and decided to show up," said senior Daniel Lubin.

"It sounds to me that he believes we should really put emphasis on the changes, but things aren't getting better." Lubin said.

To Mireille Mechoullmm, a North Miami resident and Israeli, the issue hit home. 

"He made a lot of sense about the conspiracies of corporations. They don't want us to have alternative methods, they just want money," she said.

Black answered some audience members questions after his lecture and emphasized why he wrote the book,

"All of my books have talked about a terrible past that can insure a better future. This book focuses more on preventing a terrible future and restore the good parts of our past," said Black.

Headline: Landing expected to finish in 12 years
Author: Fallan M. Thompson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A new entrance is planned as an add-on to the construction of the Biscayne Landing development project near Biscayne Bay campus. Yet, traffic is still an issue to be addressed.

As students drive in and out of BBC, the only road available to them at this point is 151 Street, half of which used to be blocked due to ongoing construction of the condominiums.  

Construction in the area is expected to continue for at least another 12 years, according to estimates from the Biscayne Landing website.

According to Nick Diciacco, senior director for facilities management operations discussions on a new entrance were agreed upon last year.

The road would be a larger route for students connecting Biscayne Bay Boulevard to 151 to hopefully ease traffic.

"There was talk about a year ago, and we more or less approved the idea. The road expansion would be widened as a part of the Biscayne Landing developments," Diciacco said.

"Traffic studies were taken of the street by the city and developer and found it would suffice for the traffic."

According to Diciacco, they also looked at drawings of the road to be widened and are considering new walls and a new sign announcing FIU and Biscayne Landing.

 The multi-billion dollar 'city with a city' condominium along 151 Street is planned as a family-friendly community, which owns the local school, David K. Lawrence K-8 Center.

The project began in 2003 and is not slated to end until 2015, according to the website.  Biscayne Landding developers were not available for comment.

The development that stretches from 137 Street to 151 Street will boast 6,000 residents and a 230-acre nature preserve.

According to the Biscayne Landing Sell Center, the development is planning 16 condominium towers, several town homes and perhaps some villas. 

The condos start at $500,000 and the town homes are going for $900,000 to $1,250,000.

 The complex will include a town center with shops and restaurants, the 25-story condo towers, which are 95 percent sold according to the website and a parking garage on premises. 

A new high school will also be built in the area east of the stadium. 

"The high school [is not a] charter school anymore," Pam Solomon, City of North Miami spokesperson said. 

"The plans have changed and it is now a [Miami-Dade School Board] project."

Kevin Patterson, senior tries his best as a commuter student to get to class on time, he looks forward to construction coming to an end.

"I hope they fix it soon," Patterson said. "I think that the construction really hurts the drive time associated with getting to school on time." 

Traffic is also caused by continual construction on the K-8 Center and up-and-coming high school.     

The K-8 school opened to the community Aug. 14 but continues to have construction occurring on site to create parking, drop-off and pick-up lanes, landscaping and other outdoor surroundings. 

Principal Bernard L. Osborn claims the construction for his school should wrap up this November.

Currently, traffic problems involving the school is between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. because students are being dropped off by both bus and parents. 

Parents have to park at the FIU Stadium parking facilities and walk their children across the North Miami Police Department's makeshift crosswalk. 

A police officer mans the crosswalk in the mornings from 7:30 a.m. to 8 a.m., according to Sergeant Robert Bage. 

"Currently, more than half [of our 900 students] ride the bus," Assistant Principal Blanca Correa-Cespedes said. 

"Our goal is to get 75 percent on the bus so parents don't have to take their kids." 

Currently, the only school zone in place is a giant traffic billboard that says, "Slow down; school zone."

According to Captain Wright who oversees public safety at BBC, North Miami police has been doing periodic strict checks of the area and has stopped numerous students for speeding already. 

There's also a plan to eventually establish official speed limits in accordance with a school zone as well as flashing yellow lights to warn students of elementary school children crossing 151.

"We monitor traffic though we can't predict the future impact of construction," Wright said.

"All in the University community should pay attention to the fact that there are children and their parents crossing and we're near a construction site."

Until the Department  of Transportation makes the area an official school zone, students face the issue of getting a ticket.

"We've been pulling over speeders, but not that many," Sergeant Bage said Aug. 28, of 151 Street's 25 MPH speed limit. "[The good thing is that] FIU doesn't start all at once."

Monique Mattiache, a junior who's classes are all at BBC summed up her opinion on traffic and construction.

"It's terrible, they're building all this near schools and it's just making more traffic," said Mattiache.

"I don't understand it, why isn't FIU expanding its own campus  rather than allowing all this other construction?  The area is so small and college campuses are expected to have traffic already," she said.
