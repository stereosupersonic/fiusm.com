TV: None
Radio: WKAT 1360 AM, WRGP 88.1 FM 
Record: FIU 4-6 (2-4 SBC), MTSU 4-6 (3-3 SBC) 

On offense, The Golden Panthers have to start where they left off against local rival FAU. Running backs Ben West, A'mod Ned amd Julian Reams combined for 269 yards on the ground. With a successful ground game, they make quarterback Josh Padrick's job easier.

On Defense, FIU will again need to begin where they left off in the Shula Bowl. A duplicate performance of last week will almost certainly guarantee victory. If the defense can force half as many turnovers, not to mention defensive touchdowns, it will be a good start for FIU's first  back-to-back wins of the season.

Headline: New version of NHL winning back hockey fans
Author: Tom Gulitti / The Record
&nbsp;
The new NHL is a hit.

After a season lost to a labor dispute, fans have flocked back to most NHL arenas this season to see what the majority believes is an improved game with more scoring, more skating and less hooking and holding.

Even in New Jersey, where the Devils have struggled to adjust to the rule changes and life after Scott Stevens and Scott Niedermayer, fans prefer this new version of hockey to the lower-scoring old NHL.

"I like it," said Karl Palzer, a Devils fan from Hillsborough, N.J. "The game is faster, quicker. There's more action. But I don't think it's helping the Devils at all."

With a mandate from the league with the intent of increasing scoring, referees have been keeping a close eye on obstruction fouls. 

As evidenced by the high number of penalties, some players are still adjusting, but by hindering defenders' ability to slow attacking players, the game has opened up.

The legalization of two-line passes over the center ice red line also has helped in this area, making it more difficult for teams to play the neutral-zone trap. 

The combination of all this has boosted scoring by 23.5 percent from 2003-04.

"To me, it's 10 times better than the old NHL," said Kevin Sinclair, a college student in Ottawa. "Talent is the most important thing. If you don't have talent, you shouldn't win. The teams with the best talent should be the best teams."

The most popular rule change has been the introduction of the shootout to break tie games. 

Fans are brought to their feet by the breakaway confrontation between shooter and goalie.

"It's great," Palzer said. "No one wants to watch for three hours and not have a conclusion."

Surprisingly, not all the fans like the increase in offense. Some still prefer the subtleties of a defensive battle.

"I hate games that finish 8-7. Give me a 1-0 goaltenders' duel any day," said Brandyn Babitskas, a Florida Panthers fan from Sunrise, Fla. "(More goals) make it more exciting when you watch it, but they're going to keep changing it to the point where it's like basketball and one goal doesn't count for much."

Some players also have been highly critical of the impact the rule changes have had.

"Everybody keeps saying this is great. It's not great," Detroit Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman told the Detroit Free Press last week. "It's not hockey."

Yzerman was bothered most by the high number of penalties, which turn some games into power-play contests.

"They've taken judgment out of it and I think it's somewhat made it easy on the referees just to call anything, because there is no judgment," Yzerman said.

Another common criticism from players and coaches is that most of the physical battles in front of the net and in the corners have been eliminated.

"The new NHL is awesome," Sinclair said, disagreeing. "The only people who don't like it are the old players who can't keep up with the game anymore."

If attendance is any indication, most fans agree with Sinclair. Entering this week, the NHL's 30 teams were playing to 91.1 percent of capacity _ a 1.1 percent bump from 2003-04 _ and 21 teams had experienced attendance increases.

The Devils are part of the minority. They averaged only 13,889 fans over their first 11 home dates, which is only 72.9 percent of Continental Arena's 19,040 capacity. That also represents a drop of 1.9 percent from the 2003-04 11-game average of 14,159.

But other teams are playing to packed houses.

 With rookie phenom Sidney Crosby generating interest, Pittsburgh's attendance is up 37 percent. 

Carolina, one of the teams that has benefited greatly from the rule changes, has experienced a 24 percent upsurge.

"I think fans in Canada like the NHL either way, but Americans were the ones that needed this to happen," said Michael Valentinuzzi, a Toronto Maple Leafs fan who lives in Ottawa.

"The people in Canada and the big markets in the U.S. like Detroit and New York were able to appreciate the game, but this has made it more exciting for the fans in the smaller markets in America where they needed their teams to do well to bring in fans."

Headline: Women's basketball squeezes by WMU
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team got its third win in a row Nov. 25 as they edged out Western Michigan in a nail-biting 66-65 victory.

After struggling throughout most of the game, the Golden Panthers went on critical runs in the second half, and center Lasma Jekabsone put the finishing touches with a put-back, off the glass, to give FIU the lead with 1.1 seconds remaining.

"I just thought I played so bad this game and at the end I had to make up for it," said Jekabsone. "I got my opportunity and I tried to make the best of it."

During most of the first half, the Western Michigan Broncos seemed to be having their way with FIU as they went on an early 11-2 run by penetrating the ball, getting key offensive rebounds and taking advantage of fast break opportunities.  

"The first half was terrible," said senior point guard Faeza Bouderra, who finished the game with six points, six assists and seven turnovers. "We shot the ball really bad and we had no offensive rebounds."

Led by Lindsey Brown's 11 first-half points, the Broncos took a 31-20 lead with just under four minutes to go in the half. But the Golden Panthers responded quickly and went on an 8-0 run with the help of freshman spark plug Iva Ciglar, and went into halftime only trailing by three.  She finished with 10 points and four assists in 19 minutes of play.

"[Iva] is a nice player; she came in with a spark and plenty of leadership and confidence," said head coach Cindy Russo. "She did a lot of things to calm us down."

The Golden Panthers got some much needed momentum in the second half, showed much more control on the defensive boards and were able to keep the game within reach.

"We had to [rebound],"  Russo said. "We told them that if they didn't start rebounding,  we weren't going to win the ball game."

After an up-and-down game for most of the second half, the score was 61-60, in favor of Western Michigan with two minutes to go. Broncos' guard Carrie Moore hit a fade-away at the baseline to put them up by three and Bouderra came back with a lay-up to cut the lead to one.  

Bouderra then came back on defense, drew the charge on Western Michigan and hit both of her free throws to put the Golden Panthers up by one.

Then Western Michigan center Lindsey Brown drove left on Jekabsone who appeared to make a critical block, but was called for the foul.

"I was so mad," said a frustrated Lasma Jekabsone. "I blocked that shot, it wasn't a foul!" 

Brown hit 2-of-2 from the line and gave the Broncos a 65-64 lead with 18 seconds left on the clock.  The Golden Panthers were down to one final possession.  

Junior Eva Makela had the ball and her shot was blocked.  Bouderra then picked it up and drove left but missed the lay-up.  Then, in a scramble for the loose ball, Jekabsone emerged and banked home the game-winning shot.

"It was just a scramble,"  Russo said. "She was just at the right place at the right time."

Jekabsone finished with 11 points, nine rebounds and three blocks on 4-14 shooting.

The Friday night win was very fulfilling and - to the satisfaction of Russo - demonstrated a lot of character early in the 2005-2006 season.

"It was a really nice win and I thought we played with a lot of heart and we came through in crunch-time when we needed it," she said.

Although the win was satisfying, the team knows its not where they want to be and have an idea of what areas need improvement.

"Our post-up players have to post up a little bit more," Bouderra said. "They need to get bigger inside and be a little bit more patient on defense."

The win advanced FIU to the championship game of the Thanksgiving Classic, where they beat Seton Hall 61-39 and improved to 4-0 to start the season.

The women's team goes on to play at Kentucky University  Dec. 1 at 7 p.m.

Headline: Rival Romp
Subheadline: Football earns first victory over FAU  
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The smiles on the Golden Panthers' faces said it all as they lifted the Shula Bowl Trophy on Senior Night.

FIU (4-6, 2-4 SBC) dominated from start to finish in record fashion, as it claimed its first ever win against local rival Florida Atlantic (2-9, 2-5 SBC), with a 52-6 win, Nov. 26 at FIU Stadium. 

The Golden Panthers tied an NCAA Division I-A record, set by the University of Houston in 1989, by returning four interceptions for touchdowns in just their second ever Division I-A and Sun Belt Conference win. 

Interceptions returned for scores by Keyonvis Bouie, Lionell Singleton, Nick Turnbull and Marshall McDuffie proved costly for the Owls as the Golden Panther defense completely dominated the fourth ever meeting between the two schools. 

Head coach Don Strock was pleased with his team's performance as he defeated his former coach, Howard Schnellenberger, for the first time. 

"The defense played well. They put a lot of pressure on the quarterback, made him get out of the pocket or sacked him and put him in long running situations, which is not something you want," Strock said. "We had the opportunity to make some plays and we played hard the whole game."

Ben West carried the offense for the host Golden Panthers as he and freshmen A'mod Ned and Julian Reams gained a combined 269 yards on the ground. West led all rushers with 26 carries for 140 yards and three touchdowns. Junior quarterback Josh Padrick completed 10-of-20 passes for 114 and did not even attempt a pass in the second half. 

"The whole team worked hard in all phases of the game," Strock said. "Special teams were very good, the defense, obviously, was excellent and offensively, we carried the ball very well."

FIU, who intercepted the ball five times for 205 total return yards, led 24-0 at half time before exploding for 21 points in the third quarter, fueled by Singleton and Turnbull interception returns and West's third score of the game.

"Tonight was definitely a team victory,"  Strock said, following the win. 

FIU moved the ball methodically, by way of the run, on their first series before the drive stalled at the FAU 14-yard line. 

Kicker Adam Moss then connected from 32 yards out to put the home side ahead 3-0 with 8:25 to play in the first quarter.

The Golden Panther defense, who forced seven punts in the win, forced a quick punt to give the offense the ball back. Ben West wrapped up a seven play, 63-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown to put FIU ahead 10-0 just five minutes later.

Strock's men didn't miss a beat as they started the second quarter on the right foot. 

They took their first drive of the quarter into the end zone for a 17-point lead. West once again broke loose, this time from 21-yards out; the touchdown capped off a seven play, 82-yard drive that spanned just 2:57.  

The defense then began their record setting night. 

Keyonvis Bouie, back after a two-game suspension, picked off a Sean Clayton pass and returned it 36 yards with just 3:46 left to play in the half, putting FIU up 24-0 as the route became official. 

The Golden Panthers came out of the locker room at halftime fired up and quickly put an end to any Florida Atlantic comeback hopes. 

"We tried to keep our composure [at halftime],"  West said, following his three-touchdown performance. "Everyone [was told] to keep their head up, [to] stay in the game because anything can happen in a football game; it's four quarters."

Clayton was intercepted for the second time that night on the first play from scrimmage of the second half, this time by Lionell Singleton, who returned the ball 51 yards for the second Golden Panther defensive touchdown of the night. FIU extended their lead to 31 just 19 seconds into the second half. 

FIU's only interception of the night that wasn't returned for seven points came on the following FAU possession.  

The defense kept up the pressure and forced its third interception as freshman Kent Henderson intercepted Clayton following a tip by senior Turnbull at the FIU 10-yard line.

West would get into the promised land for his last time with 2:22 to play in the third quarter as he took a fourth-and-goal carry from the one into the FAU end zone.  

When it appeared as though nothing could get any worse for historic college football coach Howard Schnellenberger, down 38-0, Turnbull got his name on the score card. 

With just 25 ticks left on the clock in the third period, the senior safety intercepted freshman backup quarterback McKinson Souverain as he came in to relieve Clayton. Turnbull raced untouched into the end zone in front of the student section from 33-yards out to extend the lead to 45 points. 

The NCAA record was tied in the fourth quarter as Marshall McDuffie returned Souverain's second interception 82 yards, with 6:52 left to play, putting the Golden Panthers up 52-0. 

With 2:13 left to play, FAU would score its only consolation points of the night. 

Souverain found sixth-year senior Thomas Parker wide open down the middle for a 65-yard touchdown. FAU's nightmare continued as the extra point was missed and the 52-6 score-line was complete.

The Golden Panthers finish off their first ever full fledged Division I-A season  Dec. 3 at 6 p.m. against Sun Belt opponent Middle Tennessee.

Editor:

C. Necuze's opinion piece on intelligent design (ID) is almost 100% unsupported allegation. Virtually all he says of intelligent design proponents is false.

This obfuscation is typical of the evolution movement today. From the outside, it resembles one big liars club with members entertaining each other by trying to spin the biggest yarn imaginable or set out a multitude of smaller lies faster than anyone can keep count.


If anyone wants the truth about ID, he must do what these critics only pretend to have done--go to the actual sources and see what they are proposing. It bears no resemblance to the miriad of major media strawmen.

Headline: Vice President Cheney among the few opponents of new anti-torture bill
Author: Adrian Diaz / Assistant Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
It's pretty ridiculous to argue against terrorism. It's a little like arguing against Jonathan Swift's modest proposal. There should be no talking points here. It's not abortion, taxes or even a national health care program, all of which you can reasonably argue for or against without seeming cartoonishly evil. 

However, recently it has become a question in American politics, thanks in large part to a bill pushing for regulations on the treatment of American military prisoners. The bill includes a ban on "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."

Vice President Dick Cheney opposed the bill on the grounds that it should exempt clandestine CIA activities. It might seem skewed or biased to say that Cheney supports torture, but I cannot see it any differently when he opposes this bill. 

Cheney is not the only one who opposed the bill. There were nine senators which voted against it. Those nine senators are: Wayne Allard of Colorado, Kit Bond of Missouri, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, John Cornyn of Texas, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Ted Stevens of Alaska. 

The vice president, however, has taken most of the political damage for publicly speaking against the bill. 

Cheney went to Yale (he dropped out, but at least he was accepted) so he has to be reasonably well educated. It's hard to think that someone who is halfway intelligent can support measures as extreme and heinous as torture, clandestinely or otherwise.

Cheney sat down with the three senators who have been the strongest proponents of the bill (Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and John W. Warner of Virginia, all Republicans) to try and change their minds. 

It takes a lot of gall for Cheney, who has never been a part of the military, to tell McCain, who was held captive for 5 1/2 years (two of which were in solitary confinement), beaten and tortured, to oppose a measure against the acts which he suffered. 

President George W. Bush, in Panama, said recently, "We do not torture." The president has been criticized for his choice of words and scant details. To many, it seems as the president is glossing over an important issue with simplistic language.

Mr. Cheney's actions coupled with reports by The Washington Post and Human Rights Watch, alleging that the CIA has run secret prison camps in Central European countries, however, are completely incompatible with the president's statements. If the administration did not torture, then there would be no reason to oppose the bill or to have secret prisons. 

Some have argued that torture would be acceptable in the "ticking time bomb" scenario; that is, if a bomb were about to go off, could we torture a suspect who had knowledge of the whereabouts of said bomb. 

This scenario is not very convincing to me because of how unlikely it is that it would ever occur. Even if it did happen, how could we be guaranteed that the suspect would know where the bomb is. There is still the risk of torturing an innocent man (or at the very least an ignorant man).

At a time when the Bush White House is not - to say the least - at the peak of its popularity, it is hard to comprehend why it would seemingly argue for torture, which is almost universally recognized as a grievous violation of human rights. It seems incomprehensible why they would not want to get behind something everyone could support. 

It does not seem as if Cheney is acting against the wishes of the White House. The administration has threatened to veto the vote, which is a presidential power.

Torture is a completely reprehensible and immoral act. I hate to even bring up the fact that many studies have shown that it does not work because the inhumanity of any kind of torture should be enough of an argument against it.

Headline: Intelligent design sparks new debate
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Since it was first introduced, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution has been the source of non-stop controversy among the ranks of scientists and theologians alike. When it was first published in 1859, Darwin's groundbreaking book, "The Origin of Species," caused quite a commotion throughout the global community. 

One of the biggest arenas for this debate is, and has always been, the public school system. Ever since the famous "Scopes Monkey Trial" debacle, as well as the ensuing legal battles, teaching anything but evolutionary theory in biology class has become a taboo. 

I am a devout Roman Catholic and try to attend church as often as I can. Ever since evolutionary theory was first formally introduced to me in the ninth grade, I have never had a problem reconciling it with my faith.  

I consider myself to be an evolutionary creationist, which means I believe the theory of evolution only explains, in scientific terms, what is already in the Bible to begin with. That said, I have never really been able to come to terms with a traditional creationist's interpretation of Genesis.  

Traditionally, the debate stems from whether or not public schools should be required to teach evolution rather than creationism. This creationist movement on a whole, however, was suppressed mainly because its advocates lacked the necessary scientific data to challenge evolutionary theory, not to mention their rather annoying tendency to condemn their opposition to hell. 

A new threat to evolution has emerged in recent years. Dubbed intelligent design, this is the newest and probably biggest threat evolutionary theory has seen in a long while. Where as advocates of traditional creationism have no influence in the scientific community - being mostly evangelicals - proponents of the intelligent design theory are, for the most part, scientists.

The intelligent design movement is not your everyday creationist movement. Intelligent design questions the holes which Darwinian evolution cannot explain. It uses science to attack the weak points of evolutionary theory in an attempt to disprove it. This movement has been gaining momentum since it was first introduced in "Darwin on Trial," a book published in the early 90s by Phillip E. Johnson.

Should anybody really be surprised? In a country which is overwhelmingly Protestant, any theory which attempts to negate evolutionary theory is bound to get the support of this majority. I don't think a biology class could legitimately call itself a biology class if there was not a study of the evolutionary premise. Why are we hesitating to present more than one idea to the youth of today?  

Intelligent design is, however loosely, based on facts. It is a theory that poses legitimate questions to traditional evolution, questions which should be examined and discussed, not ignored. Is it really that unimaginable to think that the children of today could possibly form their own ideas about how life, as we know it, came to be?    

Opponents to teaching both theories in school argue that teaching intelligent design is merely a way to indirectly inject religion back into the public school system, and that it is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. Interestingly enough, it is almost like the founders of the ID theory saw this coming.  

The theory of ID itself pledges no allegiance to any specific religion; it merely conjectures that life is too complex to have developed from an unguided process such as natural selection, and instead exhibits the characteristics of being developed by an intelligent cause or means.

This poses yet an even more fundamental question. Institutions such as the Protestant Church can fall under the Establishment Clause, but is God himself an establishment? We organize the world's faiths into complex businesses whose purpose is to spread the faith. Of the thousands of religions of the world, all have at least one thing in common: they acknowledge the existence of a higher intelligent being.

The institution of organized religion is an establishment and should be kept out of public schools. But, as aforementioned, ID does try to say that it was the Christian, Jewish or Muslim God, or any other god, for that matter, who was responsible for the creation of life; it just states that there was an intelligent intervention. It should not be forsaken simply because it allows for the possibility of a higher life form.  

Whether the theory is correct or incorrect is at this point undetermined, but the fact remains that it poses questions that should be discussed in a public arena. In my opinion, we should let the children decide for themselves what to believe or not to believe.

Headline: Grammar exam still problem for students
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
David Juhe breathed a sigh of relief when he received a final score of 79, finally passing the new grammar exam- a multiple-choice test that is administered to the School of Journalism and Mass Communication students through the Writing Strategies course, after taking the exam five times.

 "When you're taking it you always feel you're doing well because you have no idea what errors you're making ... you just have to know it all," Juhe, a junior majoring in advertising said. 

For over a decade, students enrolled in the SJMC were required to pass a grammar exam, in order to enter and exit Writing Strategies and move on to other courses.

The old grammar test, which was made up by The Word Association, a website that offered quizzes and practice tests, allowed students to study for the test at their convenience. 

However, because so many students were generating quizzes, the site began to crash and students who may have been in the middle of taking the exam were being affected, according to Allan Richards, interim chair of SJMC.

"Students were just taking the practice quizzes and not learning grammar," Richards said.

But to some students this wasn't any ordinary test- it was a monster.

Over 100 students signed a petition showing they were unable to study for the grammar test because of the website's failure. 

The faculty and staff then decided that it was time for a change, according to Richards.

"The grammar test had two major issues," said Richards, "the tests were computerized and there was too much testing without enough teaching." 

In order to advance to the next course students had to repeat the previous exam and get a higher score each time. 

Now, students are only required to pass the exam once with a score of 75 and the final score counts for 10 percent of the student's grade.

The problem was that grammar was only being taught in one course, Writing Strategies, making it difficult for students to obtain the education necessary to continue their college career.

"Before I took Writing Strategies, I had never taken a class where they taught me grammar other than in middle school, so passing the test was really hard," said Melissa Pino, a student majoring in print journalism. 

The new grammar test, which was modeled after a test from the University of South Carolina, is now on paper.

"You have to know the rules and take your time," Juhe said. "It's difficult because you don't know what's wrong with the sentences."

But not even test-taking tips are relieving the stress students feel from the exam.  

"The test has developed a reputation over time that is too big," Richards said. 

Giselle Quiroz, a senior who is having difficulty with subject-verb agreement, admits that the overwhelming stress is not only caused by the test, but also by other students. 

"You don't pass because no one else is passing and you go in to the test with a low morale," Quiroz, said.

Quiroz said everyone in her Writing Strategies class failed the exit exam the first time. 

She also doesn't understand how she passed the entrance exam without studying and is now struggling to pass the exit exam although she is studying.

"I use the website, but its hard because you never know what you're going to get on the test," Quiroz said.

According to Richards, the answer is simple. 

"The test gets harder every time you take it ... take this test seriously this is not punishment. It's just a refresher," Richards said.

Richards said that the demographics at FIU are changing and a university that was once predominantly Cuban-American has recently had an influx of South and Central American students.  

"Many students do not recognize that their grammar is bad and their language skills are not great," Richards said. "But, there are a lot of recruiters looking for Hispanic students."

Another issue students are faced with is the $15 fee required to pay prior to taking the exam.

"Why do they have to charge $15 every time we take the test? I don't have to pay $15 every time I take a midterm, so I shouldn't have to pay again once I'm in the class," Juhe said. 

Before, the fee was collected to run the Word Association website among other things, but now, the money is collected as an administrative charge, according to Richards. 

Richards has also written a handbook that breaks up the weekly class schedule. 

It also provides professors with ideas on what grammar tips to offer in class.

Instead of only teaching grammar in one course, "a little bit of grammar will be taught across the curriculum," Richards said. 

This semester, the school has offered three free grammar workshops, which have had a positive affect on students' scores, according to Richards. 

Students are also being offered a fourth and final workshop this semester on Dec. 9 at 9:30 a.m. in Academic II RM 110 to make up for time lost because of Hurricane Wilma.

"The grammar test is important, but if you let it terrify you, you will never know what a linking verb is," Richards said. His advice: "Keep it light."

Student gets accepted into Young Artist program of Opera

Mary Allen Assue, a voice student from the School of Music was one of six vocalists selected for the Young Artist program of Opera in Denver, Colorado. 

Hundreds auditioned nationwide. 

Before coming to FIU, Assue sang first soprano in the Grammy Award-winning Jazz Vocal I. 

This experience led to many opportunities involving commercial and studio work not only in South Florida but also as far as Japan. 

Assue earned her bachelor's of music in vocal performance and is in her third semester in studying towards a master's in voice performance. 

With her soprano voice, she has specialized in "coloratura" singing, which requires a grand amount of stamina and vocal flexibility. 

Assue can sing one of the highest notes able to be sung by the human voice. 

Since she came to FIU, Assue has studied opera and taken an active part in FIU's Opera Theatre. 

In addition to that, she was principal soloist at the Amici del arte Opera in Miami.

Bush plans to be tougher on illegal immigration laws

President George Bush promised to be more strict on illegal immigration, by enforcing better border protection and quick deportation to anyone trying to enter the country illegally. 

On Nov. 28 Bush spoke near one of the busiest illegal crossing in the U.S., 2,000 miles from Mexico. 

While Bush is becoming more strict on illegal immigration, he also renewed his efforts toward a temporary worker program designed for undocumented immigrants. 

This surprised a lot of his conservative supporters who seem to be very frustrated with the flow of illegal immigrant workers. 

Bush's popularity ratings are at an all time low and he cannot afford to loose his fellow conservatives' support. 

Bush insists that a comprehensive package includes both stricter border laws and a temporary workers program.

Parliament, which is made up of three opposition parties, claim that Martin's Liberal minority party does not reflect moral authority needed to lead the nation. 

The scandal involved the misuse of funds targeted toward a national unity program in Quebec. Martin will continue to govern along with his cabinet until Jan. 23. An election will take place to fill all 308 seats in the lower House of Commons.

Martin's push to legalize gay marriage was unpopular with the republican's but is well respected for his neutrality and open arms toward immigrants.

Headline: Club focuses on leadership, service
Author: Jackie Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Service for Peace Campus Corps, initiated in 2004 by FIU students Harold Silva, Wilbur Portalatin, Sabrina Mendez and Cassandra Andrade, has made itself recognized locally and internationally. 

Painting facilities, constructing gardens, building alphabet murals for needy children and helping in the post-construction of an elementary school are just some of the deeds the organization has accomplished. SFP received the "Outstanding Service Award" from the Student Organizations Council for its contribution to the community in just one year. 

The Service for Peace Campus Corps' motto is "Service and learning with a global peace perspective." Through several annual activities involving community service, members hope to reduce and eliminate tension, communication barriers and misunderstandings among the diverse cultural groups in the community and around the world. 

Members of SFP have been working on an ongoing project for the past two years with Camillus House, housing for homeless families, in the Summerville residence. Here, the organization works with residents in creating a community garden where they can raise their own crops to use for their meals. 

"With the residence home we worked with them; the actual purpose was to let the residents feel ownership and have them engaged to do things on their own," said Sabrina Mendez, a senior and SFP president. 

The Hope Center, a home for citizens with disabilities in Little Havana, is another one of SFP's ongoing projects. Here SFP also created a community garden and helped paint the facility; along with planting trees to help the "beautification of the city" plan at the center. "We try to make a bigger impact by starting small," Mendez said. 

Members also take part in Summer of Service, a ten-day program where college students mentor high school students through educational activities, service projects and reflections -a time when volunteers reveal themselves through group discussion or journal keeping.  The focus of this program is leadership, team building and communication. 

"It was an amazing experience being a mentor to these students. They learned that you don't necessarily have to be older to make a change in the community," said junior Cassandra Andrade, and member of SFP. 

In 2000, SFP focused on providing universal education and is working on achieving that goal. Countries around the world also adopted a set of goals, called the "millennium goals," to be accomplished by 2015. Among these goals are stopping extreme poverty; gender equality and empowerment of women; combat AIDS, HIV and malaria; ensuring environmental stability and reducing child mortality rate. 

Internationally, SFP, along with Silva and Portalatin, went to the Dominican Republic in June 2005 for 12 days and worked in conjunction with Dominican college students from Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo (USAD), and Fundacion Global. The project involved helping in the post-construction of an elementary school 20 minutes away from Santo Domingo. 

The school was painted, tiles were put in, books were donated and materials for arts and crafts were provided. The Dominican ministry of education, health and agriculture also lent a hand. 

The ministry of education helped supply the school with computers and Fundacion Global helped train Dominican professors on how to use the computers on site by having American professors teach them. There was also a lack of vegetation so the ministry of agriculture helped grow plantations. 

"The main focus was the have them create ownership of the project, so they can continue when we left," said Portalatin, senior and SFP treasurer. "A good example of this is the USAD professor of the athletics department now makes his students do community service as part of [a] requirement." 

SFP goals were achieved; after members left. The Dominican college students stayed motivated to continue service projects. 

"The main goal was called 'Culture of Service.' They were very appreciative of the help, but they now realized that they could do this themselves and that was a major accomplishment," said Silva, senior and SFP director. 

SFP will also be working internationally throughout the holidays this year. From Dec. 26 through Jan. 8, SFP will be supporting the project Nicaragua December of Dreams, where schools and orphanages from Granada and Managua will be provided with school supplies and fundraised money that SFP has been raising since the summer. 

In efforts to collect supplies for the children of Nicaragua, a contest will be held among sororities and fraternities, honors societies and clubs. The winner will be the one who donates the best supplies counted by a point system and will be awarded $100. 

"We have some items but it's still not enough to reach our goal of 1,500 children," Christian Jarquin, coordinator of Nicaragua December of Dreams, said. The competition will finalize Dec. 15, if interested, contact Christian at Christianjarquin@yahoo.com or stop by one of the meetings at University Park campus at 8 p.m. Thursdays in GC 278A. Service for Peace Campus Corps is always looking for individuals interested in volunteering. 

"With more people we can make a larger impact in the community," Mendez said.

Headline: Gas testers to aid in poison prevention
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
After the death of two FIU students from carbon monoxide poisoning last year, the Student Government Association has taken it upon itself to provide carbon monoxide awareness to the FIU community by planning a series of activities during Cram Jam, Dec. 12 and 13.

During Cram Jam, SGA and the families of the two students, are hoping to give out free carbon monoxide testers to students. 

In addition to that, Dr. Martin Marrero of the Florida Poison Information Center is scheduled to come to the university to talk to students about carbon monoxide poisoning and information regarding testers.

Carbon monoxide is an odorless and colorless gas produced during the incomplete combustion of fuel. 

 Testers are meant to prevent tragedies, such as the death of Janelle Bertot, 19, Phi Sigma member and boyfriend Anthony Perez, 25, president of Pi Kappa Phi. 

They were found dead in a minivan outside the parking lot of the Weston Town Center due to carbon monoxide poisoning in November 2004. 

Since then, SGA, the Greek student community and the Janelle Wishing Well foundation, started by Bertot's family, have dedicated time to raise awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide.

On Nov. 7, three Hialeah teenage girls were found dead inside a parked car in a motel garage. 

The cause of death is thought to be from carbon monoxide poisoning. 

Since Hurricane Wilma, two carbon monoxide related deaths have occurred. 

A 61-year-old man staying in a C& F Marine Repair shop was found dead Oct. 31; a generator was found running nearby. 

A week before this incident, a 48-year-old man was also found dead in his Deerfield Beach home.

According to Alfonzo Leon, FIU student representative-at-large, SGA is looking into ordering 500 to 1,000 carbon monoxide testers with a company called National Safety Products. 

NSP has sold testers to other universities. 

The testers should last three to four months and SGA hopes to reorder testers for students every semester. 

"We want to reach everyone and put away money every year toward testers, our future goal is to distribute a tester with every student decal," Leon said.

SGA will lobby to the state legislature for all new cars to come with carbon monoxide detectors already installed. 

Some car companies currently give customers the option of buying cars with the detectors. 

Michigan has a Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week, which gave SGA the idea of possibly lobbying for a similar week in Florida.

SGA assures Bertot and Perez's families that a bench area on campus is set aside in memory of the two students.

Pi Kappa Phi and Phi Sigma will create a rose garden is memory of the two as well and are accepting donations from all fraternities, sororities and school organizations who would like to make a contribution to the memorial. 

A vigil was held on the one-year anniversary of Bertot and Perez's death at University Park campus. 

The Janelle Wishing Well Foundation works alongside SGA, supporting carbon monoxide awareness. 

The foundation will host a series of events during the Spring semester. 

According to Gisela Granado, Janelle's aunt, the activities will take place by the end of January. 

The activities were rescheduled due to  Hurricane Wilma. 

The foundation plans to bring guest speakers promoting car safety awareness and to give out a scholarship in honor of Bertot to a student aspiring to a career in the medical field. 

Bertot wanted to be a physician. 

Bertot's mother, Barbara Bertot, met with the Miami-Dade County School Board about adding carbon monoxide awareness in driver's education classes in high schools.

Without a carbon monoxide tester, the only way to tell if a car or generator is releasing harmful carbon monoxide is if visible gas turns blue, orange or yellow in the presence of carbon monoxide.

According to the Journal of American Medical Association, carbon monoxide is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America.

1,500 people die annually caused from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and 10,000 seek medical attention regarding poisoning.

Subheadline: Fighting fat effectively through burning calories
Author: Edwin Ryan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It is often said that the key to weight loss is balance. This means that if you consume the same number of calories as you use, your weight remains stable. 

In theory, this sounds simple, however, in practice this presents an ongoing challenge for most people who have tried to lose weight.

 The pursuit of fat loss can be a rather daunting task, and to many the act of achieving this precarious balance of the energy equation seems impossible. 

A calorie may simply be defined as a unit of energy. Calories are used by the body to produce energy for bodily functions and during exercise. The calories you ingest by eating food and drinking beverages are referred to as your caloric intake.

 Those you burn by doing physical activity one referred to as caloric expenditures. The practice of reducing one's caloric intake and increasing caloric expenditure is where most people lack understanding and inadvertently have problems. 

To truly understand how to maximize on weight loss efforts, a good understanding of factors affecting daily energy expenditure and techniques to increase daily expenditure is important.

According to Dr. Liz Applegate, a registered dietitian, there are three factors which contribute to daily calorie expenditure - the most important one being your resting metabolic rate. Resting metabolic rate is the amount of energy your body uses for basic functions such as breathing, thinking and pumping blood and oxygen through your body, and accounts for approximately 60-75 percent of total calorie burning each day. 

The speed of your resting metabolic rate depends primarily on your body composition. The more muscle or lean muscle mass you have, the faster your metabolic rate. 

According to Applegate, women typically have proportionately more body fat and less muscle than men, so they end up with metabolic rates roughly 10 percent lower than men. Metabolic rate for both men and women drop as they grow older, due in part to loss of muscle mass.

The second factor in the caloric expenditure equation is physical activity which accounts for 15-35 percent of total caloric expenditure. Any activity you perform (walking, fidgeting, running) burns calories above your resting metabolic rate. 

It is obvious that continuous activities, such as running, burns more than fidgeting, so this factor varies according to the type of activities you do and how long you do them for.

The third factor, the thermic effect of food (TEF), is the energy your body expends while processing food. Digesting, transporting and storing protein, carbohydrate and fat requires energy and accounts for 75 to 200 calories burned per day. This factor usually accounts for 10 percent of your total calorie needs per day. Keep in mind that small fluctuations in TEF can add up over time. 

According to Applegate, some people who are obese usually have a decreased ability to take advantage of this factor of caloric expenditure and may contribute to their propensity of weight gain. 

Studies have shown that when factory workers change from day to night shifts that they gained weight, even though their total daily caloric intake did not increase.

 The same study demonstrated that people who do most of their eating in the evening and at night tend to put on more weight than those who consume the bulk of their calories in the morning and early afternoon. 

It appears that the TEF is higher in the morning than in the evening, so more post meal calories get burned earlier in the day than later. 

Accordingly, it may be a good idea to bulk up your breakfast and lunch - with health meals, and consider a mid morning and mid afternoon snack - preferably fruits of veggies. This may leave you less hungry by nightfall, so you'll take in fewer calories when your body is not as good at burning them.

Subheadline: Poker's popularity reaches new heights 
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Poker has recently received an enormous amount of attention from media outlets and players nationwide. According to industry estimates, anywhere from 50 million to 80 million Americans play poker. This statistic should come as no surprise due to the Internet and television stations being flooded with poker coverage, and players of all skill levels  honing their poker strategies to increase their chances of winning money.	

Three versions of poker are commonly played: Texas Hold 'Em, Five Card Draw and Seven Card Stud. Each variation follows its own set of rules but the fundamentals remain the same. Players make bets based on their combination of cards, or hand, and the player with the best combination wins the bet.

Poker can either be played in person or online, but there are several differences between the two forms. 

When playing at a casino or with friends, body language becomes a major factor in the game. The slightest gesture can give away a person's hand and completely turn the game around. In online poker, however, body language is no longer a issue. Nonetheless, skill and strategy play an integral role in winning.

"If you play online, a certain strategy is needed. If you play at a casino, a different strategy is needed. Each form of play has its advantages and disadvantages," said sophomore Christian Rojas. 

  One reason for the increased allure of the poker scene is the various free poker websites which allow players to practice their skills before heading to the casino. On most free sites, a fake amount of money is registered to each player's online account and the money can be wagered according to the user's preference. As a result, both casual and experienced players can improve their skills without having to worry about using actual money.

Although free sites are popular among players, there are also websites which allow the use of real money. The vast variety of both free and paid poker sites on the Internet shows the impact that poker has had on the population.

Aside from its prominence on the Internet, poker's increased television presence has contributed to its rising popularity. Television shows such as the Travel Channel's "World Poker Tour" and Bravo's "Celebrity Poker Showdown" showcase poker games and even include commentators and stirring camera angles to enliven the experience for viewers. The media's glamorization of poker has spread the game's appeal to a wider audience.

Because of the intense coverage surrounding poker, its legitimacy as a sport has become a controversial topic. Some people consider poker to be a sport, just like basketball and football, for it requires a certain amount of skill.

"I believe poker is a sport because you can't go into the game without knowing what you're doing - you need skills. Without a strategy, you're going to lose your money," said sophomore Daniel Estevez.

Others, like freshman Angela Reaves,  argue "that poker is not a sport because it's based on luck and you aren't being physically challenged in any way." Since players have no control over the cards they are dealt, some aspect of the game is attributed to chance. Also, poker is not physically demanding like other sports.

 Regardless of poker's standing in the sports world, its popularity has spread onto college campuses across the country. It has become a typical pastime for many college students.

"Poker is a nice break from academics," added Reaves.

Unfortunately, poker's widespread exposure comes with a serious consequence: compulsive gambling.According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, most Americans gamble responsibly, but about two million U.S. adults meet the criteria for problem gambling.

Despite the risk of addiction, poker is played regularly among friends and strangers. Nevertheless, people who choose to indulge in poker should do so responsibly.
