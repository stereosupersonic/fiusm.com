Headline: Soccer coach discusses future of program
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Karl Kremser, head coach for FIU's men's soccer team, seems as energetic as his players during pre-season training at the University Park soccer field. Sporting a wide-brimmer hat and thick shades, the award winning trainer paces back and forth across the grass, shouting instructions and sometimes running beside the players, despite the scorching heat.

Kremser, who is now entering his 26th year as the men's soccer coach, has led his team through various milestones - including the move to Division I status in 1987, two victories in the NCAA national championship game and most recently, the team's transfer to the prestigious Conference USA.

The coach recently talked with The Beacon during a break from his exhausting training sessions to discuss his love for the sport, the future of FIU soccer and his personal career ambitions.

Q: How did you get involved in soccer?

I was born in Germany, which was East Germany at the time. My parents were originally from Latvia, and after [World War II], they kept moving, trying to stay one step ahead of the Russians. I didn't see much soccer in Germany, though. I came over when I was seven and then learned to play in junior high school up in Pennsylvania. I don't think I was ever that good, but I started to get better. Then I went to West Point, where I played soccer , and we went to the final four in 1965, and that's where I got started. I did a lot of things when I was young, but it's just the game that was so much fun.

Q: Why do you enjoy this sport in particular?

Well, the beauty of soccer is that this is not a coach's game. You can prepare the team, you can do as much as you can, but once the game starts, it's not like you can call time out, draw Xs and Os and prepare specific plays. Each one of the players, when they get the ball,  have to make a big decision with what to do with it. That's the big part of the game, that everyone gets to touch the ball, that everyone can decide what to do on their own.

Q: How did you get started at FIU and what were the biggest challenges you faced during your first years here?

When I was at Davidson College, I found out that [former FIU men's soccer coach] Bill Muddle was going in with the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers, and he had a little camp during the summer and he asked me to run it. At the time, they were looking for a new coach and Nancy Olsen was the athletic director so I talked to her and she gave me the job in 1980. Now, the thing is that no one knew the level of FIU. In those days, FIU had established a tremendous reputation and my greatest concern at the time when I came here was to continue that success. I didn't know if I was up to it or not. That first year was still a lot of fun. It's still one of the most enjoyable seasons I've had just because, well, we lost two of the first three games we played and then we went all the way to the national finals. Also, I had come from a four year school, and at that time, FIU was an upper level school, so we were recruiting many junior college kids. So the challenge there was that every year you had a 50 percent turnover rate in your squad. So that was challenging.

Q: What do you think of the professional careers of former FIU players like Bobby Boswell and Men's Soccer League All-Stars Tyrone Marshall, Steve Ralston and Greg Vanney?

Yeah, those guys I certainly follow. They're all great individuals, outstanding people. I take a great deal of pride in having been associated with them, and hopefully they got a little bit of something when they were here. Also, they stay in touch, which is nice. I make an effort to watch them when they're on TV, and you could tell, even in those days, that they were special players, and to see them be successful is a tribute to them. I'm happy with what they've accomplished and I continue to cheer for them.

Q: Last season, you won your 300th career game, and this year, it seems as though the FIU team will reach their 400th game since the start of the program. How do you feel about that?

[Laughs for several seconds] Well, I don't know about that, but hopefully, hopefully. It just means you've been around a long time, you know. But really, that's just a mis nomer. You've never really won a game, you've just been associated with the team. It's the players who win the games and you just get credit for them. 

I think it's a tribute to all the players who have been here, a tribute to Munga Eketebi, who has been a tremendous assistant coach. He's like a head coach, and [volunteer assistant coach] Joe Massi has been here for a long time, too, and I've had a great deal of help in that regard. Like I said, this just shows that we've all been here awhile.

Q: Are there any standout players this season?

Yeah, I think more so than anything else. We have Lucas Scudeler, since they changed some rules for international students. [It] used to be that he was from a foreign university and never took the SATs. But they've changed things around, he can qualify another year and he should be a very good player for us. Also, we expect a lot from [team captains] Jared Rose and Paul Kolovos, who are seniors. And also Shawn Crowe, if he plays to what he's capable of, he can be one of the most outstanding goal keepers in the country. We have some talented newcomers here we're looking forward to, especially since we lost Bobby Boswell, Allen Handy and Zachary Peoples, and those guys were a formidable defensive line back. One of the new guys in the back, Sheldon Jardine, we're expecting an awful lot from him.

 If he plays to his level, that could help us a lot. Ainsley Deer is also another player, and then we have Chris Handy, Allen Handy's brother. Those three are critical. If they come play well, then we'll have a successful year because we have a lot of talent in the field and a lot of talent up front.

Q: What do you think will be some of the more difficult teams you'll play against this year?

Probably the teams in [Conference USA]. I mean, we were pre-season pick number seven in the conference out of the 10, and it's been a long time since that happened. I think that's a little low. We're usually in the middle, but we've lost a number of people.

 I can see that. But obviously, we'll find out early. We'll play University of South Florida, which has a really good team, and then we go out West before our conference game. We'll play the two top 10 schools out there and find out exactly what we have when we play Santa Clara and San Francisco. We have a tremendous schedule ahead of us and it's a tribute to FIU that they've asked us to come in as an associate member

Q: What do you plan to accomplish this season? Where do you see the team headed?

As always, we have to be a bit more realistic. In past years we've always expected to win the conference, which we've done for four years. This year, the top eight teams in the conference qualify for the tournament, and obviously we want to do that. Realistically, what we want to shoot for is to finish at least fourth in the conference so we can host the first round of the conference tournament. 

The second thing is that this will lead to the next step, which is to qualify once again for the NCA tournament, which you only get an automatic bid for if you win the conference. We want to get in there and we want to dance. We want to see it happen.

Q: You've been at FIU for quite awhile. What are your future plans with the school and how long do you plan on staying here?

Well, I'm in a program that says I have two years left, so that probably has a little something to do with it. I wouldn't mind to keep working; I mean this is not like real work. But I guess I want to go back to the national finals. That's what I'd like to do.

Q: Even if you don't stay at FIU for long, what do you see in store for the future of the men's soccer team?

I think we had a very good recruiting year, which sets the tone for the future. Also, the fact that we're in Conference USA is a step in the right direction. The fact that the athletic program is putting an emphasis back into the sport sends a pretty good message, as well. But mainly, the future's in the recruiting we've done. 

We have a lot of kids and we had a lot of success with local players, which is also good for us. I think this program will always be successful just because of where we are. We have a great talent base here in Miami. It's a great place to play soccer and we're in a great conference. I think the stage is set for the continuation of a very successful soccer program here.

Headline: Intramural and club sports  keep FIU students active
Author: Joshua Rey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It's still the first week of the semester, but are you already searching for a way to conquer the stress of reading, writing and standing in those never-ending Bookstore lines?  

If your answer is yes (and I have a hunch that it is), then you'll be happy to know that FIU has a vast array of Intramural and club sports in place to keep you active during the Fall semester.   

Coordinating these intramural and club sports is Matthew O'Connor, a fresh face at FIU who brings experience and an open-minded outlook to Golden Panthers athletics. 

O'Connor cites FIU's evolution from a commuter school to a more traditional university as the significance of intramurals.  

"It has been one of the only activities where two students can actually meet with each other and talk out of the classroom,"  O'Connor said.  

Among the activities lined up for the fall are flag football, volleyball, softball, racquetball, golf, soccer, tennis, kickball and basketball tournaments. For sharp shooters, there are free throw and 3-point shooting contests.  

If you love the long ball, then you may be inclined to sign up for FIU's very own Home Run Derby. Intellects can enter the sports trivia contest, multi-talented athletes can try their hand at the fitness challenge and rule buffs can attend clinics to become referees.  

The beauty of intramurals is that there is something for everyone. Leagues are designated for men, women, fraternities, sororities, residents and coeds. 

Winners will be awarded highly regarded "Intramural Sports Champion" T-shirts and have their pictures posted on a bulletin board in the Rec Center and on the Campus Rec website.   

For more information and a full calendar of intramural sports, visit www.fiu.edu/~camprec. 

If you are on campus, stop by and see Matthew O'Connor in room RC103.  

Club sports at FIU complement intramurals by allowing athletes to participate for their entire college careers. 

Three of the most successful clubs at FIU are the tennis, soccer and ultimate Frisbee clubs.  

When junior Francisco Musalem joined the FIU Tennis Club in the Spring of 2004, he was simply looking for an outlet to continue playing tennis after high school. 

Within weeks, he was contributing on the court as the team compiled a 6-1 record at the national championship in Daytona Beach, winning the silver medal.  

"The Tennis Club has great communication on and off the courts," Musalem said. "It's really fun, competitive and an easy way to meet cool people like me."  

Since their success at nationals, members of the Tennis Club have traveled to Orlando, Gainesville, Charlotte and San Diego, racking up victories over schools as close to home as the University of Miami and as far away as Seattle University.  

"The best thing is going on trips to other universities to play against their tennis clubs," said junior Marina Djerekarova. "If you love playing tennis, this is the club for you."

Practice for the Tennis Club is held Monday and Thursday from 5:30 p.m. until sundown at the FIU Tennis Center.  Men and women of all skill levels are welcome. Those interested in joining can contact the club via e-mail: tennis@fiu.edu.

Great footwork is not found exclusively on the tennis courts.  It is also on display each time the FIU Soccer Club takes the field. 

The FIU Soccer Club is a member of a newly formed Florida league along with UM, Florida State, Central Florida, University of Southern California and Florida A & M. 

Plans are underway to play each of these schools both at home and away, according to senior Alejandro Caceres, the club's founder.    

 "I founded this club because we are Florida International University," said Caceres, a senior. "What sport is more international than soccer?"  

In just over a year, the FIU Soccer Club has amassed 130 members from over 35 countries. The club welcomes new players, both men and women.  To find out about practice dates and to join the FIU soccer club, send an e-mail to soccer@fiu.edu.

 A longtime favorite at college campuses nationwide, ultimate frisbee made its way to FIU two years ago in the form of the Ultimate Club. Since then, President Fabio Beltramini has fostered exciting weekly pickup games at Tamiami Park. 

With shades of American football and soccer in the playing style, ultimate frisbee is one of the most unique sports in the world. 

 "Anyone can quickly learn to play ultimate frisbee," Beltramini said. "Our club fosters a very welcoming atmosphere that is designed to welcome and integrate newcomers, both socially and as a player."

Drinks, frisbees, cones and all other necessities are provided at practices from 9-11 p.m. on Thursday nights.  

A complete list of FIU sports clubs can be found at www.fiu.edu/~soc. 

Be on the lookout for sports clubs recruiting new members during the upcoming Club Fair on Monday, Sept. 26 from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. in the Graham Center. And if you can't find a club sport to fit your athletic needs, contact Matt O'Connor and let him know about it.  

A world of fun, friends and fitness is out there, Golden Panthers. Now, put down your cell phones for an hour or two and come out and play.

Headline: Dissatisfaction with physique ups
Author: Christine Borges / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Clothing has to look just right, hair must be in place and if something doesn't look perfect in the mirror, it just has to be fixed. No matter the cost. But why? Who gets to decide who is beautiful and who isn't? Who put these images of what perfection is in our heads? Who made giant, skinny women the goddesses of the future? 

Women constantly compare themselves to supermodels, and researchers believe that it is this exposure to idealized body images in commercials and women's magazines that lowers a woman's satisfaction with her own attractiveness. 

According to the National Institute on Media and the Family, by age 13, about 53 percent of American girls are unhappy with their bodies. That figure grows to 78 percent by the time girls reach 17. This should all be blamed on the media. 

"I think most women want to look like a Barbie doll or the models on the covers of Vogue that appear flawless and perfect. They think [that] by looking this way, they will be content and they feel that plastic surgery is one of the ways to achieve these aesthetic goals," said senior Eli Otero. 

But at what costs? The amount of cosmetic surgery procedures performed on women ages 19-34 are through the roof. More than 1,450,000 women had major cosmetic surgery in the United States in 2004 and over 8,000,000 women had minimally invasive cosmetic procedures done, as per the American Society of Cosmetic Surgeons.

Many would argue that the rise in plastic surgery is due to the media. Some stress that perfection is a necessity. Commercial after commercial, we see women with perfect hair and perfect bodies going on shopping binges and looking as if they are perfectly happy.

Everything from perfectly proportioned, wrinkle free faces to rail-thin bodies that fit in the tiniest of clothes is hallmarked in these ads, telling women that they too can have it all ... if they look perfect. 

But who defines perfection? Why do we all have to follow these standards? Normal women usually can't have their cake and eat it too - in this regard. Money doesn't fall off  trees for the average woman, so why does the media make it look that way?

"The media puts pressure on women and makes them think they need to be beautiful in order to succeed in life.  If women took the time to look at the beauty they already have, they'd probably save themselves a lot of time and money," said senior psychology student, Sabrina Mendez. 

But women don't see that beauty, and that's the problem. Women feel that being beautiful is a must, and many of them go by any means to get there. If shopping sprees and cosmetic surgeries are added up, women would realize that they've been spending small fortunes trying to attain what society says is happiness. 

Many magazines and fashion designers form unnatural ideals of beauty, making society think that thin is in and curvy is out.Women need to be freed from a lot of these unreasonable expectations. A lot of women think that if they don't have the precise measurements of "Victoria Secret" models, they aren't perfect.

This shouldn't be the case. Beauty shouldn't be defined as how perfect a woman looks (by the media's standards), but by how beautiful she feels naturally; without that extra unnecessary push. 

True happiness should be the new perfection, not extreme thinness and unrealistic goals. If you don't think you look great when you look in the mirror, then get a new mirror, or think about changing your attitude.

Headline: University welcomes Public Safety 'King'
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
After Public Safety Director Jessie Campbell retired, the university went through applicants and interviews to find the best-suited person for the job and Bill King was hired as FIU's new Public Safety director. 

"[King is] the best qualified candidate of one of the most competitive and qualified applicant pools I have seen in my time at the university," said Harlen Sands, executive director of Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology.

An expected increase in athletic attendance and in residential areas on campus has resulted in hiring five new officers between the two campuses. This will take place within the next month, making a total of 45 officers.

"More activities on campus, and as well as the increased residential life brings more students on campus and that adds to the burden on public safety both along the lines of criminal activity and traffic congestion around the campus. More people have a direct impact on us and the service that we provide," King said.

Prior to FIU, King worked at Wayne State University as Chief of Police for three years, before that, he was Deputy Chief of Police for the Ypsilanti Police Department in Michigan. He has a bachelor's degree in public administration from WSU and Western Michigan University combined and is in the process of finishing his master's at WMU. 

King has noticed similarities between WSU and FIU. Both are located in urban areas, have hot summers, and are diverse.

"From the very first time I drove on campus it seemed like a perfect fit for me. I've enjoyed the city and the diversity I've encountered," he said. 

King has felt welcomed into the university by faculty and staff in the short time he has been on campus.

"I have been totally impressed by how helpful the faculty and staff has been here in my first week on campus. Everyone is extremely friendly and courteous. The students I have encountered have been very positive and have such a good attitude around the university," King said.

In his spare time, King is avid about sports, particularly basketball and baseball. He played both in college and enjoys playing golf. Although he is still a Detroit fan - Pistons, Tigers, Lions and Red Wings - he is looking forward to watching the Miami Dolphins, Miami Heat and Florida Panthers play. 

He listens to jazz and doesn't care too much for rap music. 

"Other than rap I have a very eclectic taste in music. I like Kenny G a lot," King said.

He likes actors Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. However, he did not like Tom Cruise's latest movie War of the Worlds.

"The special effects were good, but the plot was weak," King said. 

One of King's hobbies includes traveling and he has been to almost every state in the U.S. He has taken cruises to eastern and western Caribbean, lived in central and west Africa for two months. He would also like to visit Central and South America.

"The exposure to people, in a third world country was a very eye opening experience," said King, about his experience living in Africa.

Public safety is currently evaluating traffic movement. Traffic congestion is expected during the first couple of weeks into the Fall semester and public safety is keeping pedestrians and students who travel in vehicles  safe with speed bumps and lighting crosswalks.

Headline: Maidique addresses FIU in China, accounting errors
Subheadline: Part two of a three-part series
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Q. Last year, the university sealed a deal to build a hospitality school in China. How is that project going and when is it set to open?

I just saw pictures from construction a week ago. They are proceeding at the rate of a floor per week. Right now, they are in the third floor of an eight-story building. The expectations are for June of 2006. I will be in Tianjin and the [city's] mayor will give me the keys to the building.

Q. The university decided to pay an $11.5 million settlement with the Department of Energy because they were investigating FIU due to "accounting errors" within the Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology. How was the settlement reached, and why specifically $11.5 million (the energy department originally said $50 million were missing)?

They made an exaggerated claim and we decided that some of their claims they were making were unjustified and we were able to get them to come down - not to where we wanted, but we wound up a lot higher than what we expected.

Q. How is the university paying off this $11.5 million settlement?

We are paying this off over five years. The funds are not coming off any current university account, but from changing the way we have invested our working capital. We found that we can go up from 2.5 to 3 percent return to about 5 percent return. That deferential of 2 and 3 percent, which is something we have done because we've had a devolution of authority that have allowed us to invest that money with whoever we wanted rather than with the state. That gave us a very significant job in return. That's how we are paying this off.

Q. As more construction keeps taking place at the University Park Campus, there is less and less space for the development of future buildings. Will the university ever try to persuade Miami-Dade County legislatures to give a portion or the entire Tamiami Park to FIU?

Ultimately, whether it's under my administration or some president at some point in the future, Tamiami Park has to become part of the university. That requires a county-wide referendum with a majority vote saying yes. We think that at some point, that will happen and that area will be completely built.

Q. Now that you mention the words "some president at some point in the future", how long do you plan to continue at FIU?

I feel great. I feel that the challenges here are extraordinary, so there is never a boring or dull moment. This is the first year that we will have Division I-A football and the first year that our students get their bar results back. There are still so many exciting things that I have trouble thinking that I will not be here.

Q. Are the challenges what drive you to continue as president?

The ability to contribute in a significant way to this community. We've made a lot of progress and I'm real proud of all the people that have been on the team and their contributions.

Look for part three of the interview in Monday's edition of The Beacon.

FIU business program ranks No. 7 in nation

FIU's international business program has moved up two spots on the U.S. News & World Report's national ranking.

The College of Business Administration is ranked number seven in the nation - still ranking among the top 10 undergraduate programs in international business, side-by-side with New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California-Berkley and others.

The college is the largest of  FIU's professional schools with more than 25,000 alumni and some 6,000 students enrolled in its undergraduate program.

Audit finds accounting problems at FIU

FIU's Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology was recently under fire after auditors raised serious financial questions - leading a $11.5 million settlement with the U.S. government.

HCET allegedly hired outside consultants without approval from university officials, didn't keep employee time sheets, paid employees with grant funds allocated for other research assignments, paid millions of dollars in travel expenses and paid some 20 employees over 50 percent more than comparable employees elsewhere at FIU, according to a report in The Miami Herald.

HCET director Harlan Sands was not available for comment at press time.

SAT math scores hit record high on old SAT, higher on new one.

Officials at The College Board said Tuesday that SAT math scores in 2005 hit a record high, jumping from 518 points in 2004 to 520 out of a possible 800. But preliminary reports show high school students in the class of 2006 taking the new SAT averaged 536 points on the math portion - 16 points higher than scores from students taking the old SAT. Students in the class of 2006 began taking the new SAT last spring.

Harvard scholars may find cure for anemia in fish; humans may be next

Scientists at Harvard Medical School believe they have found a cure for anemia in fish. This was discovered after finding out that animals have a different process in their systems to make hemoglobin. The scholars studied zebrafish to make sense of the way the molecule works. While there are several types of anemia in humans, the scientists at the school claim that the most common form of anemia in humans is the low level of hemoglobin. This can lead to a possible cure for anemia in humans. 

Anemia is a serious and potentially fatal condition that can make people feel tired and ultimately affect the heart and other parts of the body.

College survey looks at freshmen's world

For this year's college freshmen, the Starship Enterprise has always looked dated, Starbucks has always been around the corner and Bill Gates has always been worth at least a billion dollars, according to the annual Beloit College Mindset List released last week. 

The survey says new college freshmen were generally born in 1987 and grew up with voice mail on their phones, pay-per-view television and have always had the right to burn a flag. However, according to the students, most of the men entering college still don't know how to tie a tie.

The survey aims at providing professors with a look at the lives of their younger students. It is conducted by Beloit College, a private school of 1,200 students in southern Wisconsin.

Headline: Banquet raises funds for astronomy observatory
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Joan MacDonald looked through a telescope on the roof of the Kovens Conference Center and realized a dream of many decades.

"I saw Jupiter for the first time in my life," MacDonald said. "It was very exciting." 

MacDonald was one of 50 or so people to attend the Guitars under the Stars fundraiser, hosted by Dr. James Webb on Aug. 16. 

Through the fundraiser, Webb, a professor at FIU's physics department, hoped he could begin to realize his own dream; the construction of a decent student observatory at University Park.

"You can't really call it an observatory," Chris Ceron, an FIU physics student who attended the fundraiser, said about the current cement pad cramming telescopes next to the Chemistry and Physics building at UP. "And it's hard to look at the stars with so many lights from other buildings surrounding the pad." 

The construction of the new observatory - which would be located on the south side of the CP building and connected to it through suspended walkways - would cost $1 million. 

Webb describes the project as a four-story tower, tall enough to raise a platform above buildings and their blurring lights, while having space for high-tech telescopes, indoor laboratories, as well as lecture and observation rooms.

 Caroline Simpson, an astronomy and Honors College professor at FIU, said she hopes the new capabilities will help make science more popular.

"Very few Americans are attracted to the field," Simpson said. "They think science is geeky and scary. The telescope is an avenue to connect people to the greater world we live in and dispel fear and loathing." 

The night of the fundraiser, guests at the Kovens Conference Center watched a slide presentation that gave them a taste of what the observatory would look like and offer. 

For $125 a ticket, they could also gaze at Jupiter and the moon through several different telescopes, choose from a large selection of drinks, have a refined meal and dessert and experience live musical performances - including one by MacDonald's son Rod, a folk singer.

According to Webb, the fundraiser cost about $5,000. Catering services got $60 of each ticket sold, but the College of Arts and Sciences and the Department of Physics offset some of the total cost by paying for the usage of the conference center.

The guest list at the center featured President Modesto Maidique and Student Government President Alex Prado. At one point, they both took the podium to make surprise announcements.

Maidique complimented Webb on his efforts.

"I honor commitment and I honor persistence," Maidique said at the banquet. "And that's what I want to do tonight."

The honor came in the form of prospective dollars. Maidique offered to raise $333,000 toward the project once Webb comes up with $666,000, completing the million.

Prado then said he'd allocate $17,000 for the project into the next Student Government budget. That would lower Webb's burden to $649,000.

Since the state of Florida would match every dollar raised for a public program like this, all Webb would have to raise for the new observatory is $324,500.

"It's an excellent naming opportunity for potential benefactors," Webb said, referring to companies that would be willing to contribute and possibly baptize the building.

Maidique later explained the importance of the future observatory to the university and the whole city.

"It'll be a rattling point for people who are interested in astronomy in Miami," Maidique said. "And as far as FIU, enrollment would probably increase."

The observatory would make higher quality astronomical events possible, he said, attracting a variety of FIU alumni, scientists and other science aficionados  - including members of the Southern Cross Astronomical Society (SCAS), who use the university as headquarters for their meetings. 

The state-of-the-art facility would also make more courses available and thus draw more students to the university, while catching the eye of investors.

"Money follows money," Maidique said.

Maidique might get the money he offered for the project from a combination of capital and operating funds, but sources have not yet confirmed.

"The observatory is needed," said SCAS' Barb Yager, who also attended the fundraiser. "It's long overdue."

Webb has raised $2,000 so far, all of it at the Aug. 16 fundraiser. With this money, he said he has fulfilled the requirement to open an account with the FIU Foundation, a non-profit organization that administers a fund for university projects.

This is only the first step, but Webb shows no signs of backing down.

"I have to face everyday teaching students who don't have an observatory," Webb said. "I'm doing this for them. It's the right thing to do."

Headline: Students receive opportunities given by Invitational Scholars
Author: Andrew Leins / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For more than twenty years, the Invitational Scholars Program has provided students with financial and academic help. Founded in part by the current vice-president of Student Affairs, Dr. Rosa Jones in 1982, the scholarship program was meant to give low-income children a shot at receiving financial support without necessarily having outstanding academic achievements. 

The program has grown over the years from a small class of thirty students in 1982 to now currently assisting more than three hundred students. 

"Although the award money has gone up very little over the years, from $500, originally, each semester to $600 each semester; the program can now assist more students," says program director Lisa M. Walther-Austin. 

The scholarship lasts students throughout their 120 hours of course work. The Invitational Scholars Program is available to students who complete the Partners In Progress program (PIP) while they are attending high school and elect to attend FIU. 

The PIP consists of two parts: First, the students take a six week SAT prep course between their 10th and 11th grade years, they then take a mock SAT exam each week right before they take the actual SAT which takes place at the end of the six week course. 

"The course gave me a lot of tips on how to be a better test-taker," said Andrew Kameka, who is a journalism major at FIU and a PIP alumnus.  Kameka goes on to say "All the repetition with the mock SATs helped me to get used to the test and have a lot more confidence going into the exam. I went from a 1090 in the beginning to around an 1190 at the end." 

Kameka found out about the program through his CAP advisor in high school. His CAP advisor was a graduate of the Invitational Scholars. 

The second portion of the Partners in Progress program is given to students between their junior and senior years, and that allows the students to take college level courses at FIU. 

Students can take two college level courses, usually Math and English, to helps the students take care of some early requirements. The courses are taught by FIU professors. 

Students must maintain at least a 2.5 GPA or risk losing the scholarship. If a student's GPA falls below a 2.5 in a semester, there is an appeal process where students can be given a second chance. Students in the program receive academic support strategies like tutoring, counseling and CLAST preparation. 

The Invitational Scholars Program is also in the process of developing a book lending program, where students get hand-me-down textbooks from other students. 

In addition, there is a peer mentoring program where a student is paired with a recent graduate  in a similar field of study. The Invitational Scholars also has a club at FIU, where the program staff coordinates activities and helps new students in the program. 

Vice president Abah Hamilton is a peer mentor, she helps incoming students with any questions and concerns they have coming into college. 

"I was once in their place and I know there can be a lot of anxiety coming into college, so I am glad I can help them get acquainted with the college experience," said Hamilton. 

The Invitational Scholars has had several success stories; Kameka had heard stories of graduates who went on to get good paying jobs right out of college with major companies like Microsoft. The Invitational Scholars hosts several functions throughout the year, including fundraisers and award ceremonies. 

At their annual award ceremony, the Invitational Scholars invites a guest speaker, usually a graduate of the program or someone of prominence in the community. 

The program is now trying to send out current college students to high schools to recruit potential students.

"Current students, along with program staff, are really enthusiastic about getting out to the schools and getting the information out about the program, because we feel [that] the most effective way to show kids that this program can help them  is for them to see their peers  success by being a part of the Invitational Scholars Program," Walther-Austin said.

"We accept the love we think we deserve."

"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky is perhaps one the most inspiring books I've read in a while. This coming-of-age tale follows the life of Charlie, a social outcast in his freshman year of high school, as he learns how to live, love and laugh.

 Through intimate letters to an unnamed source, we begin to experience the bittersweetness of teenage angst and the beauty of friendship through Charlie's eyes. As the narrative begins, Charlie explains, "So this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be." He is the fictional embodiment of what all of us are and what we wish we were. 

Caught between childhood and adulthood, Charlie drifts through the world with nothing more than sex, drugs and The Rocky Horror Picture Show to look forward to.  In a world where mix tapes are a religion and you live for that perfect song to come out on the radio to make you feel infinite, this account of life is not only for teenagers.

"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" is without a doubt one of the most moving books you could read. Charlie's letters are not only witty and beautiful, but can also be devastating and heart wrenching. Charlie deals with everyday things like family deaths and arguments and shows us "how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other... [and how] the fights are always the same."

This MTV book is a worthy read for all ages. It is an easy read that you will find yourself picking up time and again for one last read. This 213 page novel makes you feel immediately connected to Charlie. "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" teaches you innumerable life lessons and will forever touch your heart. It will truly make you feel infinite.

Headline: Do's & Dont's of College Fashion
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
These days, it's almost impossible to walk around campus and not see at least one half naked girl walking to class. In their ultra short mini-skirts, high heels and the tank tops ... it's like they're getting ready to go clubbing. 

How can those girls possibly be comfortable wearing that stuff? There are certain things that should be kept off college campuses. Among that list are heels, mini-skirts and an assortment of other skin-bearing, uncomfortable clothing. When you have to walk a lot and sit in freezing classrooms, it helps to wear the proper attire.

Miami is a very image-conscious city, and because of this, girls feel the need to dress up to do even the most mundane things. Going to class is in no way excluded. Nothing screams "I need attention!" more than wearing skimpy outfits to school. 

You can expect a good number of female students to be decked out in their finest clothes on the most average of days, but for what? It's only class! Apart from the wardrobe being out of place in this kind of environment, it looks quite uncomfortable to be walking around in all day. 

Horror stories are told every year of how heels have broken midday with still more walking to be done, unfortunate "cleavage slips" leaving the victim trying desperately to pull herself together, and strong winds blowing up countless skirts and countless underwear shown to the general public for their viewing displeasure. If you're wearing the right clothes, this shouldn't happen to you. 

Broken heels can be avoided simply by doing one thing: Not wearing them. It's as simple as that. If you feel like you may accidentally "come out of your shirt," then maybe it's not such a good idea to be wearing it to school where you may be too preoccupied to notice your boob hanging out. Although how that happens is beyond comprehension, it has happened before. Wearing longer skirts, although not completely safe from wind-related accidents, are a better alternative than a mini-skirt.

"Girls should not wear  skirts that allow everyone to look up and see what kind of underwear they have, or lack of. They shouldn't wear shirts that have their boobs hanging out, just to keep their integrity intact and to keep everyone from looking at them, 'cause not everyone might want to look at them," said freshman Rosalynne Singh.

Walking to class can be exhausting and wearing heels everyday does not help. Sure, it may seem plausible to survive the day in heels, but once you get to walking around FIU for a full day on hard concrete, that thought slowly slips away. 

Heels look great, but the blisters you'll receive after a full day of walking don't. At the end of the day, limping around in heels is embarrassing. Wearing sneakers to school is the more comfortable alternative. If sneakers are not your thing, a pair of flats, (like ballet flats or flip flops) are fine - although they have considerably less support than sneakers.

School is a great place to meet people, but that's no reason to dress like you're going to a night club when you're attending class. Short skirts, ultra low-cut pants and skin-bearing tees seem to be a staple among FIUs female population. 

"I think girls should wear clothes. Seriously, girls should be able to wear whatever they feel like wearing, although sometimes at FIU it seems like girls are more interested in what they look like in class, instead of caring about what's going on in it," said junior Ivanessa Arostegui.

There are girls who walk around this enormous campus in clothing that even the most self-confident girls wouldn't wear. Leave something to the imagination and wear something tasteful - like a nice full skirt with a cute top, or the ever popular jeans and t-shirt. Layering is also a good way to stay comfortable throughout the day. Depending on whether you're indoors or outdoors, just remove or put on a layer to best fit the situation.

Personal style is always a must, so feel free to express yourself and your personality with your clothes. Just keep in mind what you're dressing for - school. You're dressing for class, not a music video, photo shoot or runway show, so the stiletto's can stay at home along with the sequined tube top. It may be hard to believe, but it is possible to look cute without the aid of club-wear. 

The important thing is that you stay comfortable while on campus. Many students don't have time to leave campus just because their feet hurt or because they forgot their sweater at home. First and foremost, We're all here to learn, not to fuss about how we look while on campus. This is why proper clothing is a must, because realizing that you're freezing in your psychology class and not having a sweater with you is not going to help you ace your next test.

Headline: Freshmen orientation a helpful experience for incoming students
Author: Yamilis Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"From the green fields of Tamiami, to the north shores of Biscayne Bay ... " 

The words still rang in my head as I drove home from my first day of freshmen orientation. 

Several students apparently found freshmen orientation boring, as I noticed several of them quietly talking on their cell phones or trying to take a quick nap. 

I, on the other hand, found freshmen orientation to be a very helpful experience and a big step towards easing my transition from high school to college.

As I arrived at FIU at 7:50 a.m., I drove around in circles wondering exactly where it was that I was supposed to park. 

After finding the Blue Garage, I parked my car and made my way down the stairs. 

From there I didn't have the slightest idea where to turn, so I decided to follow a group of girls ahead of me, who looked as lost as I did. 

I finally reached the Graham Center and then followed a trail of big blue signs, which had arrows on them leading to the GC Ballrooms. 

At the ballroom, I was given a sticker with my name on it along with a student handbook, an itinerary and a grey FIU shirt (I don't think I will ever wear it.) I found a few high school friends to sit with while I wondered what could possibly go on for the next nine hours.

Thirty minutes later, a group of students ran into the room and introduced themselves as our 2005-2006 peer advisors. Next thing I knew, they had all of the freshmen standing up and trying to sing and perform the FIU fight song. 

I found this part to be quite fun but at the same time, I hid so I would not be picked to go on stage. After the fun was over, a few guest speakers welcomed us to FIU and gave us some information on the university, which I hardly remember. 

We were taken on a campus tour where student organizations like Student Programming Council, Panther Rage, Student Government Association and others were awaiting to welcome us and give us specific information on what each does. 

Fraternities and sororities also gave a separate presentation as well. I always enjoyed being involved in high school and know that I will feel the same way, if not more, in college.

After a lunch break in the afternoon, I went to a designated room where I received information on my major, nursing. Then I met with an academic advisor and got more information about how to register for my classes and which ones I should take. 

You are usually advised to write down at least two or three other options for every class you are intending to take. This is something that I did not worry much about but then, on my registration day, I realized how quickly classes get filled and how important it is to have other options.

The second day of orientation started off with a few presentations about general things, like registration and information about logging on to PantherSoft, which is important for those who are accessing the system for the first time. I was once again taken to see my academic advisor to present a list of classes I wanted to take. 

The advisor then approved the list and I was directed to another room to register for my classes. 

I thought I was about to be done for the day, when a big problem arose. All of the classes I was hoping to take had been filled up and I had absolutely no clue what to do. I started to search the other available classes but all the times were horrible. 

I saw my academic advisor in the distance and hurried quickly to inform him of my problem. 

He then suggested that I join a FIG (Freshmen Interest Group) and took me to the FIG room. I was given a list to look at, and miraculously found a FIG with the exact three classes that I was hoping to take. 

A minute later, a staff member registered me into the FIG that I wanted and I was given a printed schedule of my classes. 

After two long exhausting days of processing a ton of new information, I am finally set to begin my journey at FIU and am well prepared thanks to the help of freshmen orientation.
