Headline: FIU prodigy dies in motorcycle accident
Author: Betsy Martinez & Reuben Pereira / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Derek Jacobs was a child prodigy.  At age 12, he became the youngest person to receive Microsoft certification, allowing him to run a professional computer network. 

He was also one of the first people in the world to recieve a medical identification chip implant. 

This year, he was scheduled to graduate after only two years at FIU's School of Engineering. 

However, Jacobs, 18, died around 4:40 a.m. Sept. 30, in the 8000 block of the westbound Palmetto Park Road, according to a Palm Beach County Sheriff's report. Jacobs was driving a 2005 Yamaha motorcycle when he lost control, slid along a guardrail and struck a wooden pole, the report said. 

Jacobs was wearing a helmet when the crash occurred and wasn't believed to be speeding. The Sheriff's office did not rule alcohol a factor in the crash.

For the last few months, Jacobs had been examining medical school options. 

He wanted to pursue a career in neurosurgery. 

Friend Jillian Gerena remembered the night Jacobs found out his medical entrance exam scores. 

"It was an unforgettable night full of good times," said Gerena. "He was an inspiration because I believe he truly lived his life to the fullest."

She said he partied hard, but worked harder academically. 

"The loss has opened my eyes and shown me that life is something to cherish because it could end in a second," Gerena said. 

Not only was Jacobs described as "an amazing friend," he was also a devoted brother to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, commonly known as FIJI.  He served on various FIJI committees and was committee event coordinator, scholarship chairman and recruitment chair assistant.

A few months ago Jacobs devoted hours of preparation to host a party for his brothers at the Ohio Sports Bar in Miami. 

Before moving into the FIJI house about a year ago, Jacobs lived in Everglades Hall for about 18 months.

That's where he met Andrew Chin, the FIJI president at the time of Jacobs's initiation into the fraternity and his residential assistant. 

"When they told me I was getting a 16-year-old I was like, 'What?'" Chin said. 

But Chin was surprised at Jacobs's helpful spirit and eagerness to become involved. 

"He always wanted to get his hands in the cookie jar," Chin said. 

The FIJIs will be hosting a ceremony Oct. 12 to celebrate Jacobs's life.

The time and place of the ceremony have not yet been set.

Headline: Football suffers another loss
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Before FIU took on the defending Sun Belt Conference Champions Arkansas State Indians (2-2,1-0), who were riding a five-game conference win streak,  one could have argued that the Golden Panthers had played worthy enough to have their 0-4 start be at 3-1 or even 4-0. 

Following the second home game of the year Sept. 30, however, there is no doubt that FIU is a 0-5 team. 

The Golden Panthers (0-5, 0-2) suffered their fifth straight loss as they were humiliated on their own field by ASU 31-6.

Right from the start there was no doubt that it would be a long day for FIU as on the first play of regulation, senior quarterback Josh Padrick stepped back and found a wide-open Tyrell Johnson at the FIU 30-yard line. Unfortunately for Padrick, Johnson was the Indians' starting safety.

Padrick finished the night 18-of-35 for 177 yards with no touchdowns, three interceptions and a fumble.

ASU, who had intercepted the FIU signal caller four times in a 66-24 whitewash in Jonesboro, Ark., last year, wasted no time and quickly rolled down the field before freshman backup running back Cedric Wilkerson capped off a quick eight play drive with a one-yard touchdown run. 

"Games are won in the trenches," coach Don Strock said. "They won the trench game and congratulations to them. We've got a long way to go but we have a lot of improving to do. We'll come back to work Monday just like we do every week and work to improve. Believe me, we have a lot of improving to do in some areas."

Down 7-0, FIU's first chance came with under three minutes to play in the first quarter. Following prior drives that ended in punts, Padrick found his groove by completing a quick 20-yard pass to senior wide receiver Chandler Williams at midfield. From there, the Golden Panthers would reach the ASU 19-yard line before the drive stalled.

Freshmen place kicker Dustin Rivest attempted a 37-yard field goal only to have it blocked at the line of scrimmage.

ASU, who ran a two pronged attack at quarterback with freshman Corey Leonard and sophomore Travis Hewitt, took a two-touchdown lead with 6:01 to play in the first half as Leonard ended an 11 play 67 yard drive with a seven yard scamper. 

Down by 14, the Golden Panthers got a breath of life from sophomore defensive lineman Jonas Murrell who tipped a Hewitt pass at the line of scrimmage and returned it himself 25 yards to midfield.

Padrick's nightmare start to the season, one which has seen him throw just two touchdowns coupled with eight interceptions, continued as he threw another interception with 50 seconds left in the second quarter, ending the Golden Panther drive and crushing any momentum that could have carried over into the second half.

"Our quarterback didn't play well," Strock said. "We didn't make catches when we needed to. We had our opportunities but it didn't happen."

On their opening drive of the third quarter, the Indians rolled down to Golden Panther 23 before ending their drive with a 40-yard field goal attempt miss. 

On the ensuing drive, the young, inexperienced Golden Panther offensive line gave way to ASU's Koby McKinnon who flew in and sacked Padrick and caused a fumble. Fellow ASU defensive lineman Jamarrow James recovered the ball at the FIU 19. 

With little field to work on for the second time following a turnover, the Golden Panther defense was unable to contain freshman running back Reggie Arnold, who rushed 26 times for a blistering 146-yards on the night.

Three plays later, Hewitt rushed for 7-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 21-0.

The FIU offense, which managed just 186 yards all night, including nine yards on 19 carries, was unable to produce anything and looked primed for their first shutout of the season. 

"After playing pretty well for the first four weeks and having opportunities to win in the fourth quarter, we didn't have an opportunity from the first play of the game tonight. It started there and ended with the last play," Strock said.

With 5:47 to play in the third quarter, Arauco was blocked, this time from 37 yards, and the Golden Panthers looked to have gained some momentum with a big hole to dig themselves out of.

They took advantage despite of terrible field position and drove 84 yards before A'Mod Ned punched in the first FIU points of the night from five yards away with 1:40 to play in the third. Rivest's extra point attempt was blocked, bringing the score to 21-6.

ASU place kicker Josh Arauco opened the final frame by connecting successfully for the first time in three attempts from 19 yards out, putting FIU in a 24-6 hole.

A second Hewitt touchdown, this time from two yards out with 4:14 to play, would seal the game but not before Padrick was intercepted for the third time that night by Dominique Williams, his eighth turnover against the Indians in two career games.

Chandler Williams, who coming into the night was leading the Sun Belt in receptions and yards, solidified those league leading numbers with seven catches for 72 yards. Samuel Smith grabbed six for 65. 

ASU dominated all facets of the game as they dominated possession 35:57 to 24:03 and out rushed FIU 222 to 9. The Golden Panthers also shot themselves in the foot, committing 12 penalties for 121 yards; four of which were personal fouls.

The kickoff for the Oct. 14 tilt between FIU and Miami at the Orange Bowl was also announced. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

Headline: New stadium brings more than recruits
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU Stadium at University Park is about to get a face lift and coaches, players, administrators and students are buzzing about the possibilities it can bring to the 5-year-old football program.

"Our students voted for a football program that all of us can take pride in," said University President Modesto A. Maidique. "This is a major step in that direction."

FIU's Board of Trustees unanimously approved the construction of a multi-purpose university complex Sept. 29 that includes renovations to FIU Stadium and construction of a student center.­­

The stadium renovations are expected to approximately cost $34 million while the student center will be $24 million.

School officials are hoping to have the project completed by 2010 and have broken the project into four phases.

Phase one will be completed before the start of the 2008 football season. It will include a wrap-around concourse with a full field view, 14 luxury suites, 1,400 club seats, a video score board and a stadium club.

Following the completion of phase one, FIU Stadium will be able to accommodate 20,000 fans and 45,000 upon the completion of the entire project.

 "I'm excited about it," freshman running back Devon Freeman said. "We'll have a lot of fans coming in by then."

FIU football home games will be played at the Orange Bowl next year while renovations are being made.

The second phase of the project includes the construction of a six story 100,000 square-foot student services building that will house undergraduate advising, admissions, financial aid and a welcome center. 

Many of these offices and departments are currently located in Primera Casa and will be moved to the new student services building when construction is completed in the Fall of 2009.

Once all of the student services have been moved to the new student services building, all the empty office space in PC will be converted to classrooms, which will open sometime in 2010.

During the last two phases of the project, 25,000 additional seats will be added to the stadium.

Coaches and players believe that the renovations made to FIU stadium will give the Golden Panthers more of a home field advantage when opponents come to play.

"All the freshmen are looking for to it," said freshman quarterback John Paul Fraites. "That was one of the big keys that they told us about on our recruiting visits. [The stadium] should give us more of an edge noise wise and it will also make it more fun for the fans."

Coaches and players are hoping that stadium renovations and improved facilities will help bring in more talent to the program.

"To be competitive in [Division] I-A, you have to have facilities," said FIU athletic director Rick Mello.

Besides its uses for football, Mello said that the renovations will allow FIU to bid for high school football playoff games and even soccer games.

The University has even had preliminary discussions with Major League Soccer about using the stadium if another soccer franchise were based in Miami.

Officials are hoping to break ground in March.

Headline: Men's soccer nearly upsets top team in nation
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU nearly overcame the absence of two starters and its head coach, but an overtime goal from SMU forward Scott Geppert crushed the Golden Panthers's bid to upset the top-ranked Mustangs.

No. 1 SMU (11-0-1, 1-0-0 C-USA) won 3-2 thanks to Geppert's strike in the 102nd minute. The golden goal preserved SMU's undefeated record and ended a volatile Sept. 29 match that included 39 fouls, five yellow cards and three ejections.

FIU (4-4-2, 0-1-0 C-USA) played more than 30 minutes with only nine men. Senior forward David Hope received a red card for fouling an SMU defender in the 67th minute, and so did head coach Karl Kremser when he protested the call. Sophomore defender Phill Fisher joined the pair four minutes later after he was sent off for a hard tackle.

"I'm still at a loss of words because of the officiating," Kremser said. "I thought we had turned the game around and were starting to take it to them before those calls. It's unfortunate  that the game ended that way."

FIU fell behind 1-0 in the 39th minute after junior defender Raoul Voss fouled an SMU forward 25 yards from goal. On the subsequent free-kick, forward Chase Wileman arched a shot that bent around the defensive wall and into the top left corner of the goal.

FIU later equalized when SMU defender Leone Cruz accidentally knocked in a cross from Hope in the 66th minute. Moments after players celebrated their own goal, the series of ejections began.

Despite the two-man disadvantage that followed, FIU went ahead in the 77th minute. Junior midfielder Dadi Kristj&aacute;nsson fired a penalty kick straight into the top center of the goal to give FIU a 2-1 lead.

"Oli [Birgisson] was fouled and I just wanted to take the penalty kick more than anybody else," Kristj&aacute;nsson said. "I had to put it away when we got that chance."

SMU quickly answered with a goal from midfielder Bruno Guarda in the 79th minute. Guarda booted in a loose ball inside the penalty area and sent the match into overtime.

SMU then out-shot FIU 5-0 in the two overtime periods. The Mustangs held a 29-9 shot advantage in the game, as well as a 9-2 lead in corner kicks.Though FIU put up a brave fight, SMU's two-man advantage and pressing offense proved too powerful to overcome. After stopping several advances in the first overtime period, the Golden Panthers allowed the game winner to Geppert, who knocked in a pass from Guarda seven yards in front of the goal.

"We worked so hard and played 30 minutes 9 on 11 against the No. 1 team in the country," Kristj&aacute;nsson said. "I don't think we could have played any better than that, but we shouldn't have lost like this. Those calls were just wrong."

Many FIU supporters shared Kristj&aacute;nsson's frustration with the referee's decisions. Following Fisher's ejection, loud chants of obscenities in both English and Spanish nearly resulted in a penalty being assessed against FIU. Police officers later escorted the officiating crew to their cars after fans hurled insults at referee Reggie Rutty.

Despite the uproar, Kremser stressed the value of his team's performance and perseverance in the match.

"I told them all that I couldn't have been any more proud of them," he said. "The effort of every player on the team has to be commended. Anyone who stepped on that field for FIU - I'm extremely proud of them."

Headline: Volleyball undefeated in Sun Belt
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The volleyball team continued on its best start in Sun Belt Conference play after three straight road wins over Troy, South Alabama and Florida Atlantic Sept. 29, Oct. 1 and Oct. 3, respectively.

The victories put FIU 14-4 on the season overall and 6-0 in conference play. The Golden Panthers have won seven consecutive matches - the team's longest winning streak since 2001.

"This team doesn't care who they're playing against," said coach Danjiela Tomic. "They take it one game at a time and they're out there to win."

The Golden Panthers have swept seven matches this season, including four of six conference matches.



FIU 3, Troy 0



The only positive thing to come out of the 3-0 sweep for the Trojans (7-13, 1-3) was that they out-blocked FIU 4-3. 

Freshman Yarimar Rosa led all players with 21 kills in the match and an outstanding .515 hitting percentage. 

Freshman Olga Vergun added seven kills and junior Keila Oliveira set a match-high 39 assists.

"We have one of the best setters in the nation [in Oliveira] and that makes a big difference in the success of your team," Tomic said.

FIU out-attacked its conference foe hitting at a .358 clip, while Troy hit just .080.



FIU 3, USA 0



Rosa again led all players in kills with 14 and recorded nine digs.

"[Rosa is] one of those players that you come across once as a coach," Tomic said. "The excitement that she brings is just contagious to the rest of the team."  

Oliveira again led all players in assists with 38 and added 12 digs and six kills. Junior Alyse Santisi had a match-high 16 digs and junior Anita Szymanska had three service aces, also a match-high.

As a team, the Golden Panthers had seven service aces and out-attacked the Jaguars (5-12, 0-5) .276 to .152.



FIU 3, FAU 1



Oliveira laid proof to her coach's words as she recorded a career-high 71 assists - just two off the school record - and a match-high 19 dig, as well as seven kills.

Freshmen Arasay Guerra, Rosa and Vergun recorded double-digits kills with  24, 29 and 16, respectively. 

As a team, FIU had 91 kills to beat the Owls (7-9, 4-2).

The Golden Panthers will return home and continue conference play Oct. 6 at 7 p.m. against North Texas and Oct. 8 at noon against Denver.

Headline: Golden Panthers should not be surprised by results
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The first play of the game should have been a sign of things to come for the FIU in their 31-6 drubbing at the hands of Arkansas State.

Senior quarterback Josh Padrick's interception set the tone for a game that was all-around ugly.

Coach Don Strock said after the game that there was enough blame to go around, so it would be unfair to put all the blame solely on Padrick, who threw three interceptions in the game.

The defense didn't come out nearly as effective as it had against its four previous opponents. Senior linebacker Keyonvis Bouie admitted to players becoming complacent after the close call against Maryland. He said they were over-looking the Sun Belt Conference opponents because they had kept the game so close against an ACC opponent.

Obviously, a team that is 0-4 cannot afford to be over-looking opponents, but this team did and now FIU is 0-5.

Even when the game was well within reach at 21-6 in the third quarter, FIU players were noticeably out of the game - kneeling on the sidelines with their heads down. Apparently they were shocked to be losing to a team that beat them 66-24 last season.

At the post-game press conference, both Strock and Bouie said that they knew the Indians were going to try and run the ball. And the Indians still amassed 222 rushing yards - compared to nine from FIU.

That definitely sounds like a team who was overlooking its opponent.

So the fact that you're 0-4 can't motivate you. The fact that you lost to this team by 42 points a year ago can't motivate you. Then, what will?

Now, I'm in no way saying every player was over-looking ASU; there had to be some players giving it their all. But if the captain of the defense says there were players doing just this, I'm going to believe him - especially if FIU showed some signs of it.

At this point, it's hard to try and stay positive about this team, especially with Miami and Alabama coming up on the schedule.

With the team 0-5 and not even half-way through the season, you would think it can't get any worse than this. But looking at the seven remaining games, which also features a Troy team that almost beat No. 17 Florida State, it quite possibly can.

It's really hard to pinpoint what this team needs to improve on. One week it's the special teams, one week it's the offense and now, this week it's a bit of both combined with the defense.

All those issues have been addressed, such as the place kicker, but FIU doesn't have enough personnel to make changes at every single position and some players aren't ready to take the field full-time yet.

So what to do then?

There's really no definitive answer, but Strock did say something else at the post-game press conference.

"The game starts and ends with both lines," he said. "They blocked us and we didn't block them."

Basically, for the team to be effective, both the offensive and defensive lines have to be effective. According to him, no player did anything different. The protection just couldn't pick it up.

Strock says he is staying with the same game plan for the next game against North Texas.

Now let's hope that North Texas will be the ones to make the mistake of overlooking its opponent.

Subheadline: FIU should cater to students, not businesses
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Student organizations have long used pizza sales as a source of revenue. With arrival of Bène Pizza on campus, these organizations are now being told by the University that they must find another means of fundraising. 

According to Felicia Townsend, director of Business Services, allowing students to sell $1 slices of pizza just a few feet away from Bène is a disrespectful gesture towards the University's business partners. 

What's disrespectful is Bène's profits taking precedence over student clubs' opportunity to raise funds.

Pizza sales provide a steady flow of funding to organizations such as the B-HIVE Project, which educates students about HIV, and other student-run non-profits at FIU.

According to Student Government Council at University Park President Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, SGA hopes to find a common ground to make sure students can somehow fundraise without "offending the pizzeria or the University."

One solution suggested by SGA is that clubs sell pizzas in locations other than the Graham Center. However, the traffic through GC during lunchtime is higher than in any other part of campus.

Another proposed solution is that Bène sell student organizations boxes of pizza at wholesale prices. In view of Bène's retail prices, it is hard to envision their wholesale prices being anywhere near those of the outside vendors where clubs buy their pizzas now.

SGA's solutions are toothless and ineffective, and they seek to please the administration rather than find the best possible solution for the students. 

If Bène - a well-funded, well-equipped professional operation - finds itself in a bind as a result of competition from student food sales, it must be doing something wrong.

If a few students hawking cold pizza for $1 can bite into Bène's profits, its pizza must be either overpriced or undercooked. Simple economics  dictate that, by selling a quality product for a reasonable price  - a goal presumably within its reach - Bène should have nothing to fear.

More importantly, it is not the University's place to shelter Bène from the consequences of doing mediocre business in a free-market economy. And under no circumstances should that come at the cost of the livelihood of student clubs.

Granted, Aramark, Bène's  parent company, might be a good business partner and financial donor to the University, but the administration needs to understand that, as an educational institution, its primary goal should be to benefit the students and not the University's pocket books.

Subheadline: Turnpike location best site for proposed FIU Metrorail station
Author: Steven P. Williams / Senior /  Music Performance
&nbsp;
As a student of FIU and someone who has attended the public meetings concerning the placement of the station as well as the alignment of the proposed east-west extension of Metrorail, I feel confident that the 107th Avenue alignment is not the best choice for FIU or the overall community. 

If the 107th Avenue alignment were to be followed, the station at FIU would become an end-of-the-line station. Those stations tend to be the busiest stations on transit lines. The design for the 117th Avenue station called for creation of parking for roughly 1,200 cars. Under the 107th Avenue alignment, we would lose the parking lots south of 16th Street and east of the parking garages and the Wertheim Performing Arts Center to transit parking. 

Security in the lot immediately to the east of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center is already a problem. On the UP campus alone, during 2005 there were over 90 incidences of burglary or auto theft. By placing a Metrorail station on campus, the campus police would be stretched even thinner than they are already. As the closest police entity, no matter where the station is placed, they would be the first responders. Placing the station on campus, though, would open up our campus even more to outsiders who may be there for unjust reasons.

A transit station on the FIU campus would make traffic worse. If one imagines the traffic FIU faces already, plus transit-related traffic, the image becomes one that is very frightening.

Already, parking is at a premium on campus. As mentioned earlier, FIU would lose two constantly filled parking lots to transit-oriented parking. In other end-of-the-line stations on the current Metrorail system, such as Dadeland South on any morning during the week, the station quickly fills with cars. When that happens, people travel the half a mile to the next station, Dadeland North, and park there. When that lot fills, drivers end up parking in the Dadeland Mall and Dadeland Station parking lots. If a station is built on campus, when the two proposed parking garages fill, drivers will instead park in campus parking. 

Additionally, transit officials want to eventually extend Metrorail further south to the ever-growing Kendall area. The 107th Avenue alignment does not make extending the line beyond FIU possible. 

All of this alone is reason enough to consider the turnpike/117th avenue alignments. When coupled with those arguments made by the City of Sweetwater and its surrounding municipalities and communities, it becomes less and less practical or feasible to build a Metrorail alignment on 107th Avenue.

Headline: America's MORAL CRISIS or lack thereof...
Subheadline: CHRIS ON CHRIS: A POLITICAL DEBATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
Author: Christopher Cabral and Christopher Necuze / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Chris Cabral ~ On the Left:

There are some who would have you believe that America has descended into a satanic epoch of moral depravity.

Don't be fooled. The moralists who are proclaiming our imminent smiting at the hands of a vengeful god are the ideological descendants of those who said the exact same thing in the early 20th century. Back then, they claimed the key to our salvation was prohibition. Today, they say we need a more "Christian" government that is committed to banning abortion, stuffing homosexuals back into the closet and stopping schools from teaching "evil-lution." The truth is that American society is not in "moral decline," and, as history has shown us, breaking down the separation between church and state will not make us more godly - it will just politicize religion, corrupting both the church and the state.

First of all, to state that America is in moral decline implies that this nation was once a bastion of morality. Most of the moral doomsayers point to the 1950's as the high-water mark for American values. In reality, self-proclaimed "Christians" in government supported segregation. Lynchings were also very common. Women were widely treated as inferiors. Hispanics were treated unequally, even in Miami, where many businesses displayed signs that read "No Pets, No Kids, No Cubans." This country has actually drastically improved in its morals when it comes to its treatment of women and ethnicities.

When some claim this nation has become too secular and that we must become more "Christian," they're not talking about Christians like Martin Luther King Jr., with his support of liberal social policies and his opposition to the Vietnam War. What they really want is "conservative Christianity." The effort to convince Americans that they're all depraved miscreants is nothing more than a political tool. Religion should not be politicized in such a way. After all, religion can be twisted to justify any belief. In the 1700's, some used the Bible to justify slavery, citing Genesis 9:22 (the curse of Ham). Atrocities from the Spanish Inquisition to the Taliban government have been perpetrated in the name of morality.

Our forefathers deliberately included a clause in the Constitution protecting religious freedom. After all, they were fighting for independence from a monarch who claimed to rule by "divine right." Many of our forefathers were far from fundamentalists. Ben Franklin was a deist. Thomas Jefferson edited his Bible by cutting out all the parts he disagreed with. He once said: "Question with boldness even the existence of God." Were Pat Robertson alive in their time, he would have dismissed their ideas as the musings of "godless heretics."

This country is filled with moral and immoral people of all religions. We're not in moral decline, and to say this country was once entirely moral is incorrect. Moreover, to say that we are too secular and must become "more Christian" in order to end this decline implies that people who aren't Christian have made this country less moral.

If laws were passed based solely on the religious beliefs of a certain group, be them Christian, Muslim or Buddhist, it would violate the religious freedom of all other groups. Even the beliefs of different Christian denominations contradict each other. 

The fact is, this country has thrived as a secular democracy for over 200 years. I see no reason why we should abandon the constitution that has served us so well to become a theocracy. 



Chris Necuze ~ On the Right:

The United States is at war; it is at war with secularism. In our personal lives, we Americans enjoy the freedom of religion promised to us by the First Amendment. Publicly, however, this is not the case.  Unfortunately, our nation's morality is at stake. 

The issue of morality in the United States is complex and intricate. Its story is not so much about the fall of morality, but about the rise of secularism: a political philosophy that rejects all forms of religious faith and worship. As God is removed from our public life, it is no surprise that morality among the youth of this country and the citizens in general has begun to deteriorate.

A study conducted by the Josephson Institute of Ethics documented the deterioration in moral conduct of American youth. The study, administered in 2002, found that students were 13 percent more likely to cheat on exams than they were 10 years ago. The study also found that 93 percent of teens admitted to lying to their parents, up 10 percent from 1992.

The rise of secularism in America has almost single-handedly undermined traditional moral values in America. Liberal lawmakers and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union distort the constitution to suit their agenda. They strive to destroy any reference to God in the public eye, calling it separation of church and state.

The framers of the constitution included in the constitution a clause barring the government from exclusively endorsing a specific religion. The problem herein lies with the fact that God himself is not an establishment. The Catholic Church is an establishment, but God is not.

Few can forget the ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California, which ruled that the word "God" in the pledge of allegiance was unconstitutional, or the proposed idea of removing the phrase "In God We Trust" from American money by those on the left.

Around 90 percent of Americans believe in some type of higher deity, or God. Can somebody please explain to me why the vast majority must conform to accommodate the views of a few? 

I am not suggesting in the least that anyone be forced to believe in anything; everyone is entitled to his or her own beliefs. However, just because you don't believe in God does not mean that you are entitled to keep others from professing their faith, even in a public arena.

In the United States, a relatively secularized society, religious ways of thinking are seen as inferior to science. People who speak out against social standards that they believe to be unethical are shunned by society as fanatics, and, in some cases, are viewed as hindrances to the advancement of technology.

The deterioration of the American family can also be blamed for the erosion of morals in America. With divorce rates through the roof, children are not receiving the proper care, supervision and morals necessary to become a functioning member of society.

The separation of church and state is indeed an essential part of this country's tradition. However, when the actions of a few violate the views of the masses, something is wrong. 

The fact that we are even discussing morality is evidence that something has changed.

The more we remove God, the deity - not God the church - from society and the more we ignore His impact on the lives of the vast majority of Americans. If this continues, we have only ourselves to blame for the decline of morality in the United States.

Headline: Gulf oil find threatens the alternative fuel development
Author: Roque Corona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A group of geoscientists led by Chevron tapped a petroleum deposit four miles beneath the ocean floor and 270 miles south of New Orleans in the early days of September.  The company estimated that the region contained between 3 billion and 15 billion barrels of oil.

While this discovery may sound like great news in light of the high gas prices and instability in the Middle East, the discovery in the Gulf of Mexico makes it unlikely that we will move away from oil any time soon.

Chevron's oil discovery, which is expected to become operational as early as 2010, could boost U.S. domestic reserves by half and decrease our dependence on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. 

However, that independence from foreign sources may not last long, according to government figures.

The U.S. Energy Department estimates that the U.S. consumes roughly 5.7 billion barrels of crude oil a year, while its reserves currently exceed 29 billion barrels. Combined, that makes for a maximum of 44 billion barrels.

 Assuming that our oil usage remains stagnant, the country will still only have a little less than eight years' worth of supply. Then we're back to foreign dependence and more involvement with Middle Eastern politics.

And though lower gas prices may be met with enthusiasm, it's important to think in the long term. Higher gas prices will present more incentive for people to switch to alternative fuels, which is the only true solution to the oil crisis.  

Keeping prices at $4 per gallon will help the United States remove itself from its oil addiction and make the switch to alternative fuel sources, but that seems improbable with the new find.

Oil has many possible replacements. Biofuels, electric automobiles, renewable-source electricity generation, fuel cells, and various other technologies exist and are waiting to be improved. 

These technologies cannot contend with our addiction to cheap and available sources of energy.

As a Miami resident, I witness the shocking nature of America's oil addiction every day.

The daily sight on the Palmetto or I-95 is the horde of giant automobiles-occupied by only one passenger - stacked in traffic and spewing exhaust all over the city. 

It's an immensely inefficient and dirty system, and one that we must remove ourselves from quickly.

The sooner our country begins to move away from oil, the better off we will be in the future.

Do we really want our children or our grandchildren to be dealing with the same oil crisis we face now?

Headline: SGC-UP reinstates student readership program
Author: Christopher Lazaga / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For the third time in as many years, the Student Government
Council of the University Park campus will be reinstating the FIU College Readership Program.

This time around, the New York Times will be the newspaper offered to students. 

The FIU Readership is a program put together by the Student Government Association in order to make national newspapers available to students at little cost to them.

"It would be an amazing way to bring the news to FIU students," says Melissa Sabatier, Academic Affairs Committee chair.

She is working with Alfonso "Alfie" Leon, SGC-UP president, and representatives from the New York Times to make the Readership Program a reality.

When implemented, the New York Times will be available for daily purchase at University Park via coin-operated vending machines, or from a student working at a newsstand in the Graham Center.

"The newsstand idea would be great because it will open up more jobs for students on campus," Sabatier said.

The cost of the papers is yet to be finalized, but Sabatier asserts it will be between 25 cents and 75 cents per copy. The rest will be paid for by SGC-UP.

All deals with the New York Times should be finalized within the coming month, and then the two week trial period can begin.

The main goal is to publicize the program as much as possible. "It would be fantastic if we can sell up to 1,000 copies," Sabatier said.

The main problem with the Readership program in the past was that not enough students knew about it.

Consequently, the program was pulled after an unsuccessful
first semester in 2004. The program wasn't brought back for the 2004-2005 academic year but went through a trial period under the adminstration of former SGC-UP President Alex Prado in Spring 2006.

The outcome of the current trial period will determine whether or not the program is axed or expanded.

As of now, the only paper available through the service will be the New York Times, though other national papers like the Chicago Tribune, the Washington Post and perhaps even the Miami Herald may be added to the program.

FIU students seem to have mixed feelings about the program.
Some have higher hopes for the program, whereas some have more of a pessimistic point of view.

"I think its good that [the newspaper is] available here because many students spend a great deal of time at school. I don't have time to watch the news on TV," said student Sarah Doe.

Student Caonex Abreu disagrees.

"It doesn't sound bad, but I don't see FIU students really reading that many newspapers," Abreu said.

Headline: Non-credit program addresses debated issues
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students from diverse disciplines come together every week to discuss hot issues in public policy.

The Student Honors Mentor Program, part of the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship Studies, offers students non-graded, non-credit learning experience each semester.

This Fall semester, students are focusing on either low-scoring high schools and educational reform or national security and the American media.

Past topics include DNA testing, environmental policy and civic engagement. 

Small groups of students, generally in the single digits, meet weekly for two hours with a professor who has expertise in the specific topic.

Meetings should not be called classes, however.They resemble more informal conversations where ideas and opinions are freely and sometimes hotly exchanged.

At the fi rst meeting, Sept. 28, students engaged in a debate about the achievement levels of immigrant children with their mentor, Professor Brian Peterson of the history department.

"Parents who come to America want their kids to partake in the American dream, and they want them to do well in school," said Peterson.

Students immediately disagreed, some passionately stating that many poor families encourage their children to work and place work above education.

The dynamic of the conversation remained ardent throughout the rest of the meeting, as Peterson and his students tackled other issues, including disciplinary problems in schools, uniforms and school vouchers.

Instead of bending down to take notes, students raised their voices to debate, and in the place of a lecture outline, Peterson's contact information was placed on the board, including his home telephone number.

"This is a nice change from the usual large classes," noted senior Sharayna Rolle, one of the participating students.

"[I decided to participate] to be with people from different disciplines and be exposed to some current issues in education." Rolle said.

Junior Tanesha Rankine agreed.

"It's just different," Rankine said. "I like the mentoring aspect of it, too, and want to learn about problems in high schools in the area."

This particular group will focus on three area high schools: Jackson Edison and Central, which many of the students participating are familiar with.

"I wanted to do this because I realize that it's something that is a real problem in South Florida," said Junior Charisse Hurdly, a public administration major.

Rankine, who wants to work with high school students once she graduates, was hopeful about the future impact of the program on participants.

"Hopefully some us can then go out  there and make some changes," she said.

The Student Honors Mentor Program recruits small numbers of high-achieving students to participate every year.

It works with the Registrar's Office to obtain a list of juniors and seniors with a minimum 3.2 GPA and consequently contacts them via e-mail to tell them about the program.

Admission into the program is limited, as it aims to keep the groups small. Spots are fi lled on a fi rst come, fi rst serve basis.

By working closely with students and professors from different academic areas, the program seeks to achieve the larger objectives of the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship Studies.

The institute was founded in 1985 by Senator Jack Gordon.

Its mission statement says that it intends to "help students and faculty understand the impact public policy has on their daily lives and in their career pursuits."

Though in his department Peterson specializes in European history, he is also interested in policy analysis dealing with public schools in Miami.

Peterson explained his participation in the program.

"This is just what I do," Peterson said. "Beginning with my participation in the civil rights movement during the 1960s, I have always had an interest in public policy and trying to make things better."

Professor John Stack serves as director of the Institute and teaches in the department of political science.

He specializes in public law and domestic and international politics, and this semester will serve as the mentor to
the National Security and the American Media group.

Although the program is not for academic credit or for a grade, students are expected to make a commitment and be engaged.

Headline: Gandhi event brings record crowd
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A group of FIU students recently participated in the largest studentled volunteer event ever recorded in Miami-Dade County history.

National Gandhi Day of Service took place Sept. 30 around the nation. Nationally hosted by the South Asian American Leaders of Tomorrow, the event was locally coordinated by area universities which succeeded in also making the Miami NGDS the largest in the country.

NGDS's goal is to embody the famous quote by the Indian leader, "Be the change you want to see in the world." It does so by bringing together large groups of people to volunteer and celebrate in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi.

Since 2003, FIU's cross-town neighbor, the University of Miami,
has organized the event. In what began with only a few dozen studnts, National Gandhi Day of Service has expanded tremendously. Last year, UM had over 600 students come together for the event. This year, over 900 UM students gathered along with over 400 students from FIU, Miami-Dade
College and Nova Southeastern University combined. 

Assistant Director of the Center for Leadership and Service Patricia Temino explained how FIU came to partake in NGDS.

"This year we got involved because [UM's Butler Center for Volunteer Service and Leadership Development] called us and asked us if we wanted to be a part of this event they were hosting," Temino said. "They really wanted to reach out to the college-wide community."

FIU accepted the invitation and began recruitment in early September. Over 70 students from FIU signed up to attend, but only 30 actually showed up.

Two buses took students from FIU to UM. The event was kicked
off by Mayor of Coral Gables Don Slesnick as he said to students, "You are the ones to make a change in the world!"

Breakfast and t-shirts were given out as groups dispersed to various volunteer sites around Miami. 

Sophomore Mikana Maeda was among the 30 students who volunteered. 

"I feel that service is very important and I wanted to be a part of honoring Gandhi, who was such an important part of the world peace movement," Maeda said. "I will definitely do it again next year."

Other FIU students served as site leaders to one of the 26 locations where groups volunteered. Site leaders received special training prior to the event. 

Junior Lillian Marquez, co-director of Alternative Spring Break, was one of three FIU students who received training.

"This was a lot like ASB since the training covered education, conflict resolution and refl ection time to help us go over the service with participants," Marquez said.

Marquez's site took twenty students to Oleta State Park in North Miami, minutes from the Biscayne Bay Campus. There, volunteers helped clean up the shoreline onthe bay by picking up trash.

Marquez commented on the positive impact the experience has beyond temporarily achieving a cleaner shoreline.

"This is really cool to do because you don't realize how much trash people throw in the ocean until you see it…and a lot of people didn't even know where Oleta State Park [was]. Now that they know, they'll hopefully become more active in visiting and volunteering, and that brings more attention to it from the government, which can bring more funding," she said.

Among the other organizations volunteers ser ved are the Community Partnership for the Homeless, Camillus House, Citizens for a Better South Florida and Roots in the City, a community garden project in Overtown started by FIU psychology professor Marvin Dunn.

Once students fi nishedtheir community service projects, they returned to UM for lunch and a cultural showcase. Over jasmine rice, vegetable pakora and other Indian specialties, students
enjoyed special performances by UM students.

Behind the magnitude and success of the event, there was a lot of work and money involved.

Keith Fletcher, director of the UM's Butler Center for Volunteer and Service Development, estimated the total cost of the event
to be at $18,300, in addition to in-kind donations received.

To help offset the costs involved in transportation, supplies and other incidentals, UM relied on a massive group effort.

"UM put in about $9,000, and then a lot of it was donated or subsidized. We called on a number of different companies
and this year, other colleges too," Fletcher said.

In addition to its 30 sponsors - including Pizza Hut, Imlee Indian Bistro, Publix, Costco, and Krispy Kreme, to name a few - the event was partially funded by participants, who were asked to make a $5 donation.

UM student Shawn Shah, an executive board member of Be the
Change: NGDS - the club that planned the event -explained the process.

"We started planning in the spring of last year and continued on into the summer, fundraising, getting sponsorships, making all the materials and recruiting sites," Shah said. "We wanted to increase the caliber of Gandhi National Day of Service this year and to empower others to get involved and make it a huge Miami-scale effort."

Neither Shah nor Temino discarded the possibility of FIU one
day hosting NGDS on one of its campuses, both saying that they hope it happens.

"I think starting next year FIU will get more involved in the planning aspect and take more of a leadership role," Temino

Headline: Clubs asked to move pizza sales
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Like many other student clubs, BHIVE Project, an organization dedicated to HIV education, depends largely on pizza sales to reach its fundraising goals.

Members of the B-HIVE Project set up tables in the Graham Center at University Park almost every weekday to sell slices of pizza. Although they participate in other fundraising activities, losing pizza sales as a source of income would be devastating to their budget.

"If we're not allowed to sell pizza, we will not be able to raise funds. We will have no money, basically," said Tamara Marryshow, co-founder of B-HIVE.

However, student organizations that depend on selling pizza in the GC to reach their fundraising goals may need to rethink their business plans due to a recent initiative from the FIU Business Services office.

Director of Business Services Felicia Townsend approached Student Union Board Chair Michael Jadoo a few weeks ago with the suggestion that student organizations fi nd ways to raise funds other than selling pizza in GC.

According to Townsend, allowing students to sell $1 slices of pizza only a few feet away from Bène, the recently opened pizza venue in GC, is a disrespectful gesture toward the University's business partners. Bène sells a slice of pizza with
one topping for $2.69 plus tax.

"I want to make sure that we fulfill our contractual agreements and act in a way that is respectful and sensitive to our business partners," Townsend said.

Bène is operated by Aramark, the company that provides most food services on campus, including Fresh Food Company. Aramark is the University's largest business partner, according to Food Services Consultant Jonathan Garcia, as well as one of its largest financial supporters. It gives FIU about $2 million annually in contributions, and in exchange, the University
grants it the right to sell food on campus.

Aramark has a contract with the University, which grants it exclusive rights to most kinds of for-profit food sales on
campus, according to Garcia. The contract does not cover non-profit food sales on campus, which leaves room for student
organizations to sell food for fundraising purposes, since the proceeds are immediately invested back into students' educational, social and philanthropic activities.

What specific changes clubs will need to make in their fundraising activities, and when and how the University will implement and enforce the initiative, is still to be determined.
In fact, the initiative is only an idea at this point, which Townsend plans on developing in cooperation with the Student Government Council at University Park.

"However this idea formalizes will be a joint effort between our office and thestudents; we want to try to fi nd a happy medium," Townsend said.

According to Townsend, developing the initiative may include fi nding out how other universities have handled similar situations, or perhaps a forum in which students can offerideas. The end result could just as well come in the shape of a new university policy regarding student food sales or a set of recommendations for students to follow.

What is certain, Townsend said, is that the intention is not to deprive student organizations of fundraising opportunities, or even necessarily of the chance to sell pizza. 

Possible solutions could include relocating pizza sales to places such as the Green Library, which are further away from Aramark's venues, diminishing the amount and frequency
of student food sales and encouraging students tosell other products that do not compete with Aramark's products.

SGC-UP members have ideas of their own. Jadoo and Leon see a feasible option in negotiating with Aramark so that student organizations can sell Bène pizza to raise funds. This could involve Bène selling boxes of pizza to student clubs at wholesale prices, so that they can later resell them at higher prices by the slice.

Aramark Resident District Manager Jeff Nadlman, who represents Aramark on campus, could not be reached for comment.

Despite the imminentchanges in student food sales policies, members of the B-HIVE Project are already discussing possible
changes with Leon.

"SGA has assured us that we will fi nd a way to make this work, even if it makes a compromise. Right now, we have to trust that they will work to fi nd the best situation for students," Marryshow said.

SGC-UP's plan involves communication with students and clubs to determine which solutions are best for the clubs, and negotiating with Business Services to fi nd a solution that is acceptable to the University.

Headline: The Clean Up
Subheadline: Janitor's salary increased after struggle with administrators
Author: Maria Chercoles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In between scrubbing toilets and picking off chewed gum from the Green Library carpet at University Park, Maria Isabel Frias, one of many janitors who help keep FIU clean, attended union meetings at the UP English Language Institute's Labor Center.

She worked for Vista, one of the companies FIU has been outsourcing its cleaning services from for the last 10 years, and received a minimum wage payment of $6.40 per hour with no benefits.

"In the four years I've worked here, I had no vacation or sick days," Frias said. "I have a small girl, so I had no choice but paying my own health insurance. If I ever had to take her to the doctor, I just wouldn't be paid that day," she said.

However, after FIU announced Sept. 27 that it would turn janitorial jobs in-house instead of outsourcing them, life for the approximately 150 current employees who work for Vista and Best cleaning companies is changing.

The decision will cost the University an estimated $1.8 million a year, setting a new custodial worker's starting wage at $9.58 per hour.

"We have decided to make this significant investment because this is an opportunity to leverage existing operations and address employee concerns simultaneously," said CFO and Senior Vice President for Administration and Human Resources Vivian Sanchez in a press release.

After investigating similar situations around the country, Sanchez persuaded the administration that hiring the workers as FIU employees was the best solution.

The decision was reached after pressure from workers, student clubs like United Students Against Sweatshops and representatives from the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, Federal and Municipal Employees, who began organizing meetings last summer to improve workers' benefits.

Still, some janitors were scared.

"I knew about the union meetings," said Ary Crespo, a janitor who has worked for Vista for four months, "but I feared losing my job, so I never went," she said.

Frias was not so fearful.

"I knew I could get in trouble," Frias said. "But, if we didn't get together on this, we would never get any benefi ts, so I went to a couple of meetings."

After union talks last summer, more than 80 percent of the cleaners at FIU wanted to form a union - making SEIU their bargaining agent.

In early September, the FIU Joint Labor Council sponsored a meetingfor faculty and others to hear out the janitors' demands. About 30 - all immigrant, Hispanic women - attended the forum during their lunch breaks.

"These women were not experienced public speakers by any means," said Alan Gummerson, president of the United Faculty
of Florida chapter at FIU. "But once they got over their shyness and started speaking, they had no trouble communicating."

On Sept. 27, nearly three weeks after the hearing, a group of cleaners marched to the President's offi ce in the Primera Casa
building at University Park. However, the administration had already made its decision that very morning and University President Modesto A. Maidique announced to the workers that they would once again become University employees.

The decision will transform into an almost 50 percent salary increase for some workers, going from a $13,000 yearly income to a $20,000 a year state job, which, with all the benefi ts - including vacation, sick leave, disability, retirement plans, tuition waver for the employee and family members and a health insurance plan - may reach an estimated total compensation of $29,000 per year.

FIU's decision follows recent efforts from unions to raise workers' compensation in South Florida after the state granted
its universities the authority to negotiate contracts and determine terms and conditions of employment.

In February, the University of Miami faced worker strikes, student protests and pressure from SEIU, which led to the university granting better compensation to its workers.

At Nova Southeastern University, workers were not that successful. President Ray Ferrero Jr. announced Sept. 29 that the university will rebid a contract involving 300 workers, which
could make them have to re-apply for their jobs.

"It is important to highlight the role of the students in giving a voice to the workers," said Senior Pablo Avendano, a political science major and member of the FIU United Students Against Sweatshops club. "They are part of our University, so
as students, we are responsible for their well being."

The transition will take place immediately. However, state laws require that these positions be posted and opened to any applicant. Current workers will be granted the first interviews, but some worry that the positions could be filled by other applicants.

"We need to be vigilant that cleaners who were outspoken and emerged as leaders in the struggle for a union do not be
victimized," Gummerson said.

"I think the University reacted fast to avoid negative publicity,"Avendano said. "Before I call this a victory, I want to see all these employees who struggled so much actually being hired by FIU."

Vista representatives were unavailable for comment.

Headline: Early investing influences future finances
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When it comes to finances, students such as freshman Janell Benzaquen feel that societal pressures encourage the idea of "spend now, save later."

"Today's society gives us the idea that spending excessive amounts of money at a given time gives us some sort of self worth," Benzaquen said. "People that identify with that type of wasteful mindset are in for a surprise when we get older."

Others predict a bleak future without government aid, such as sophomore F. Mauricio Artavia.

"Unless balanced by an analogous system, [this] would damage the population of our country in the future," said Artavia. "If we do not plan for our financial futures now, we will never be ready when the future comes." 

Whether it's depending on aid or investing early, the experts - including professor Shahid Hamid of the finance department - feel planning should start now. 

The first step to getting ready is knowing just where your finances stand in the present.

"Use a spreadsheet to build a budget for yourself," said Hamid.   "Include what your expenses are and how much debt you have. It's a simple exercise but you learn a lot from it." 

Once you have a budget set up, you're then ready to start navigating the oft-confusing waters of investment. 

One option is purchasing bonds, which essentially means lending money to a corporation. 

Overall, bonds can be somewhat less risky than stocks, but also have less potential for accumulating over time. 

The second option is stocks. Upon purchasing stock you now own part of a corporation. 

Professor Hamid advises students to give them preference over bonds.

"In the long run, stocks pay a lot more than bonds," Hamid said. "Purchase between five and 10 stocks."

Financial planners emphasize the importance of doing your research before investing in a particular stock, since educated decisions will prevent you from making investing any riskier than it needs to be.

They also stress the need to diversify one's portfolio, balancing the types of stocks purchased, for example between large-cap and small-cap stocks.

Large-cap stocks are those in big, secure corporations, while small-cap stocks belong to newer, fledgling businesses. 

Large-cap stocks are safer, but small-cap ones may come with greater potential for increasing returns.

 Whether you choose stocks, bonds or just a simple savings account as your mode of investment, it's recommended that you save 15 percent of your pretax income every year, unless you've started investing later in life, in which case you should raise that figure to 25 percent. 

Saving this much, or any amount, is difficult but not impossible, as Artavia and Benzaquen show by example. 

"My sister does bankruptcy law, so it had been instilled in me to save, save, save," Benzaquen said.

Artavia admits he could do more, but is still saving in two different ways. 

"Currently, my planning for my financial future is confined to bonds and savings in the bank," Artavia said. "Other resources, in a few years, will be most profitable and efficient in securing my financial future."

Headline: Students turn to fake news programs for information elements
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
For students like sophomore Arnold Colina, watching the evening news can be a bore.

"It's just not interesting," he said. 

The next time you're flipping through channels because you're trying to find an  interesting newscast, you might find one in an unlikely place: Comedy Central.

"Fake" news shows and periodicals such as "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" and The Onion offer the public an alternative to the hard news format of shows such as "CNN Newsroom" and MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris Matthews." 

One way that fake news differs from serious news is the comedy aspect, according to international relations professor Christopher Brown. 

"The shows are attractive to college students because they mix entertainment with real news," said Brown. "I think there are so many serious media outlets for people that it helps to have a bit of sarcasm in your news."

While someone (or something) like Kermit the Frog would not be a special guest on a serious show like "Meet the Press," the opposite holds true on "The Daily Show," where host Jon Stewart sat down with the famous amphibian and asked him some questions; comedic situations such as these random Muppet guest appearances are common sights in satirical news shows.

The same humorous elements can be seen in print media. 

The Onion uses sensational headlines such as "Report: Majority of Americans Unprepared for Apocalypse" to capture audiences' attentions. 

In the world of fake news, nothing is sacred. 

Even though fake news has comedic elements, it does have a serious side. 

While The Onion is mainly composed of made-up news stories, both "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report" - another Comedy Central faux news show - deal with real events, albeit comically. 

When Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot his hunting partner Henry Whittington earlier this year, "The Daily Show" lampooned Cheney by using the situation as a running gag.

Because fake news programs parody real news, should such shows be considered a valid news sources? 

Brown believes so.

"I consider these programs real news sources because you're gaining information even though you don't realize it because you're being entertained," he said. "While the shows aren't in-depth, at least they offer some information that viewers can later research for themselves."  

Sophomore Alejandra Ramirez agrees that such cynical news sources can be just as informative as other authorities in news reporting.

"If a person only watches stuff like 'The Colbert Report,' I think they're just as informed as someone who watches CNN," she said. "Both put their own spin on the news, and both inform people of events."

Despite their similarities, both mediums are set apart by a particular trait: tact. 

While authentic news is intended to be unbiased, fake news often attacks topics from every imaginable angle, consequently  resulting in the audience's surprise and laughter.

Although fake news consistently pokes fun at certain political figures such as President George W. Bush, FIU students such as junior Juan Vega do not believe that the coverage is biased.

"Sure, fabricated news constantly targets specific people as the butt of jokes, but I don't think it's biased because the insults aren't limited to a particular group," Vega said. "Everybody is a target."

Regardless of whether fake news is biased, individuals such as Brown still  believe that such news is another source that the public can use to get their information.

"This type of news appeals to people who don't have the patience for regular news," Brown said. "Real journalists have to learn to respect it because it's here and that's what people watch."

Subheadline: Halloween Horror Nights fails to make skin crawl
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Universal Studio's Halloween Horror Nights attempts to turn horrible dreams into life, but the reality is, after sawing off an arm and a leg for sub par scares, what you'll have left in your wallet is the true nightmare.

Granted, the elaborate design, atmosphere and makeup for the park is top-notch and it has come a long way since it's humble beginnings in 1991 as a three-night stint called "Fright Nights." 

However, with the million-plus dollar budget allotted to the event, the money seems as though it's spread out too thin, not focusing enough on the actual operation of the haunted houses, the event's flagships.

"We use the park's landscapes to influence design," said T.J. Mannarino, leader of entertainment art and design for the event, explaining the use of Universal Studios this year versus Islands of Adventure, which is where the event was held for the past two years.

Mannarino said the sets of San Francisco and New York allowed for better and more realistic "scare zones" - which are places in the park where "scareactors" are free to jump out from behind just about anywhere to scare patrons.

The scare zones did in fact make up for what the houses lacked. In the "Deadtropolis: Zombie Siege" area, the pasty-faced undead sneak up on you pretty well. But the costumes mostly makes you want to stop and say "Cool!" instead of shriek.

Once you circle the park after avoiding the 100-minute wait times for the haunted houses, the clear inferiority of Universal to IOA is apparent. The few rides that were open were not impressive. While it was scheduled to operate, the Revenge of the Mummy rollercoaster was out of commission, leaving the mildly amusing Men in Black: Alien Attack as the next best ride. The other attractions are barely worth mentioning, especially as severely outdated rides like Jaws and Earthquake weren't scary 10 years ago, much less now.

This places even more of an expectation for the haunted houses to be terrifying, and unfortunately, they did not live up to it.

In "Psycho Path: The Return of Norman Bates," you are accosted at nearly every corner by men in drag talking about their mothers ­- nothing that you couldn't get in certain areas of South Beach at 4 a.m.

"Run: Hostile Territory" attempts to recreate the horrifying scenes of movies like "Saw" and "Hostel." The only thing this house was hostile to were my heels as they tried to jam too many people through the house at the same time. This was a sign of disorganization that was apparent in the houses as well in the express lane, which led you to the middle of the line only to wait another 20 minutes to get through.

 Despite these flaws, the park actually succeeds in one vital area - it knows what's scary. From men with chainsaws to creepy old ladies, the park tries to reach all bases and cover as many niches as possible (even the author refused to go anywhere near the clowns).

However, it's this desire for mass appeal that results in shoving as many people as possible into a haunted house to reduce wait times, as well as the goriest scenes in movie history played on a loop in the middle of the park. Eventually, you become desensitized and the novelty of the concept gives way to reveal the annoyances that come with attending any amusement park. 

The ticket cost is $59.95 without tax, and the park is only open for five and a half hours on random days. With wait times averaging at an hour, the average attendee can expect to only see four out of seven haunted houses, and that's with forgoing any show like the Bill & Ted horror show or Bettlejuice's Graveyard Revue. 

Yet, the experience is not all bad and as a group activity could be quite fun as long as you have about $200 to spend overall. But, the scares are nothing you couldn't accomplish by having a horror movie night in a friend's living room.

Headline: A.N.S.W.E.R answers questions
Author: Jessica Solis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A.N.S.W.E.R, a new organization at the Biscayne Bay Campus, aims to provide students with "information professor's don't have," according to its president Muhammad Malik. 

Started in 2001 right after the Sept. 11 attacks, A.N.S.W.E.R - which stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism-is a nation-wide activist group that opposes racism and military occupation in foreign countries and supports civil and immigrant rights. 

The chapter is brand new, but FIU chapter president Malik already has many ideas about what A.N.S.W.E.R. would like to accomplish.

"The A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition creates the social space for students to develop their own ideas about what's going on in the world," Malik said. "We want to raise awareness on these issues and act on [them]."

According to Malik, A.N.S.W.E.R. creates a space where students can debate.

The organization is known for its anti-war demonstrations and will be taking part in several protests; including one Oct. 28 where several A.N.S.W.E.R. chapters will hold a rally in front of the North Miami Navy Recruiting Station to protest military occupation in Iraq.

In their first general meeting held Sept. 29 at the first floor of the Green Library at University Park, the organization showed "Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land," a 2004 film that investigates the different ways in which Israeli politics is influenced by the American media.

The film focuses on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and states that American media gathers support for Israel through public relation efforts and propaganda and what the general public perceives as objective news is actually a "hidden occupation" by Israel on the U.S. media.

During the film, the dark room buzzed with comments as graphic depictions of death and violence were scattered throughout the documentary.

After the film ended, a heated discussion ensued between members of the audience, many of whom strongly agreed with the film's view points. 

"We're here to see finally the other side in depth," said Roger Williams, a graduate student. By the other side, Williams was referring to the Palestinan perspective. 

Mark Seaton, a North Miami resident, was the lone dissenter. He questioned the film's lack of objectivity and its failure in giving both sides of the story.

Seaton told the audience that by not being objective they were becoming what the film was condemning: unfair and biased.

Members of the audience continually debated with his opinions, saying he did not comprehend the true nature of the film.

"I was just asking legitimate questions. If we're here to discuss the truth, we ought to show both sides of the story," Seaton said. 

 "This is not to show who's right or who's wrong," said A.N.S.W.E.R. Vice President Lina Alqaddoumi. "There's a lack of Palestinian voice in the media."

Headline: Kovens Center serves as chapel for couples
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
When Sabrina Gonzales, a self-proclaimed "bridezilla," was searching for the perfect place to hold her wedding reception, the Roz and Cal Kovens Conference Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus was the last place she would ever consider.

"When you hear FIU, you think 'Ugh, I don't want to get married on campus,' but when you go to see the place, you understand why it's so popular. It's really beautiful," she said.

The conference center is not only known for hosting corporate events. Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, theme parties, retirement parties, sweet sixteen parties, Quinces and proms can also be held there. 

And every so often, the sounds of Felix Mendelssohn's "The Wedding March" resonate from within when former FIU students are able to marry at a fifteen percent discount.

Gonzales met future husband Jonathan Gonzales in graduate school at Notre Dame and they later wed on March 25 at the St. Francis De Sales church in Miami Beach.

The couple decided to have their cocktail hour and reception at the conference center mainly due to the scenery it offered.

"We wanted a wedding by the water," said Gonzales. "The view was so beautiful. It was a perfect fit."

Gonzales and her husband had a cocktail hour for their 250 guests after the ceremony on the terrace of the conference center.

Guests were able to dine on hors d'oeuvres while listening to a flamenco guitarist as the sun set over the bay.

Following the cocktail hour, the guests were ushered into the inside of the conference center to wine and dine.

All of the tables were decorated in fuchsia and sage green, and the vases of the centerpieces were lined with lime slices.

"The people who work there are wonderful and very professional. Everything ran so smoothly. It was the best day of my life," she said.

The conference center boasts 5,508 square feet of wedding space, a sweeping terracotta-tiled terrace for weddings and wedding receptions, accommodations for up to 300 people and panoramic bay-views.

Couples must first draft a contract with the center prior to planning their event and give a deposit of $500. There is a separate deposit of $1,000 for catering.

The conference center requires of every wedding they host to use their catering service, Thierry's Catering and Event Design.

"We have a beautiful location here and the location itself makes a beautiful venue and the perfect setting for a special occasion like a wedding," said Seenu Ramalingam, director of conferences for the Kovens Center.

Leslie Germana Elie, who held both her wedding and reception at the center, said it fit everything she requested for her wedding, but the "icing on the cake" was the view of the Biscayne Bay.

"Every window you opened had a view," she said. "It was an amazing view."

Elie planned the wedding with the conference center 10-months before the event was to take place.

The conference center helped Elie get in touch with a decorator, put together the candle centerpieces for the tables, and go over the budget for the wedding. 

"They were really very helpful. They were very courteous at all times and understanding of our needs, she said.

The FIU alum married Gregory Elie on July 8. The ceremony took place at the first floor entrance of the center. 

A gazebo decorated with red and ivory roses was constructed in front of the altar where the couple said their vows.

Elie said she would recommend the conference center to anyone who is planning a wedding, especially with treatment she received from the staff.

"You get to know them and they get inside of your heart like family," she said.
