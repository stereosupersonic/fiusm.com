Headline: Club helps maintain Jewish identity
Author: Jennifer Roiz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Hillel Second Generation is a national organization that began in September 2004 with the goal of bringing Jewish college students together in a social setting. 

H2G offers events and activities on and off the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. H2G gives students the opportunity to learn about their Jewish roots and traditions. The main vision behind H2G is to inform the younger Jewish generation about the importance to preserve the Jewish people. The organization is not exclusive to FIU; members also plan activities at the University of Miami and other universities. 

"We would never turn anyone away. However, the program is geared toward Jewish students. H2G is a place where Jewish students can socialize with their peers," said Leaha Widrowicz, program director at H2G in Aventura. 

Members describe the club as welcoming. 

"They had a table on campus. I thought it was cool, so I gave them my phone number. They called me right away and I attended an event," said Gily Zimmerman, a public relations student at FIU who recently began attending H2G's events. 

H2G hosted a welcome back party for its returning students at Novecento Restaurant in South Beach on Sept. 6. The party was a time for students to meet new people or spend time with friends. 

H2G focuses on social activities to give Jewish students the opportunity to socialize.

"A lot of Jewish clubs that are out there deal with the religious aspect for the most part, but our organization is more social," Widrowicz said. 

Student members agree that the social aspect of the club is attractive. 

"I think H2G is necessary because the normal social atmosphere of college is fun and great, but being a part of a Jewish group is imperative to maintaining the Jewish identity" said Jonathan Alpert, an FIU student and H2G member. 

Widrowicz said it is encouraged for Jewish people to date and marry within their culture because it will result in the growth of the Jewish people.

H2G does not require membership or event fees. However, contact information is required. 

Events planned for the fall include Shabbat dinners, family gatherings on Saturday nights, the day of rest in the Jewish religion; a campout; a poker night; various athletic games such as soccer, basketball and tennis; and speed dating with students from other universities, an event where students talk for about a minute to their date. 

"I met a girl who had just moved here from Israel at one of our meetings," Widrowicz said, "She was living here, [in South Florida] completely alone, and after attending one of our events [last July], she had a boyfriend and five friends by the end of the week."

The club also promotes a free 10-day trip to Israel for Jewish students. The trip, Taglit Birthright, is sponsored by Taglit-Birthright Israel, a partnership of philanthropists, Jewish communities and the citizens of Israel.

Members must be between the ages of 18 and 26, and never have been on a peer trip, Any trip that is an organized group trip to Israel, such as a Jewish youth group trip for more than five days, Widrowicz said. 

Registration for the December trip opened Sept. 5.

H2G's building is located on 20488 West Dixie Highway, where students can take lessons in salsa dancing, cooking and Hebrew, among others.

H2G is funded by donations contributed by members or groups of the Jewish community.

Headline: BBC Library: Librarian still helping others after 29 years
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
An author and painter, Susan Weiss has also become the Biscayne Bay Campus's South Florida encyclopedia since first becoming a librarian on June 1, 1978, according to Scott Kass, the BBC Head of Reader Services Department. 

"She developed a true interest of South Florida," Kass said, "When we have a question we go to her." 

Kass said he has never regretted the decision to hire Weiss. She does not regret accepting the job, either.

"It's a very interesting job," Weiss said. "I get to help people with many different subjects. As the campus has grown, it's gotten more interesting." Weiss received her undergraduate degree in History from New York University in 1971, a Master's in Library Science from Southern Connecticut State University in 1975 and a Masters in Public Administration from FIU in 1986. 

When she was approached by FIU for a possible job, she took a flight from her home state of New York to Miami where Kass greeted her.  

Weiss herself takes a more humble view of her skills and knowledge. Her passion for Florida history culminated in the publication of her book Miami Bibliography, which was published in 1995. 

The book is an extensive bibliography of different books, magazine articles, journals and other resources about South Florida. Weiss said it took her about 12 years to complete it. 

Weiss said that there are many entries in the book that do not appear in general search of the FIU library database because of their age.

"This was before computers," Weiss said. "We didn't just have the databases. There are also older resources you probably won't be able to find online."

Her book is now available in its entirety on the FIU database.

Weiss's current project is her "South Florida Studies and Reports Online" Web site. Unlike her book, this reference Web site is open to the public; only those with access to the FIU library network can view her book online.

Weiss's idea for the Web site came about when affordable housing issues were raised and no one could find resources on the subject. She set out to find them and instead compiled much more such as references for topics on education, art and housing.

Kass said that, for the most part, Weiss has remained in the background as far as leadership is concerned. Her passion is for learning about Florida history and helping anyone who needs help finding information.

"She is always very supportive of my work," said Therese O'Connell, a senior library technical assistant. "Weiss is always helping me learn about the various collections at the BBC library."

Weiss has also been painting for 20 years as a way to express herself.

Weiss describes her artworks similar to those of Henri Matisse, a French painter from 1900's who was known for his use of colors and draughtsmanship. She describes her style as being modernistic. 

Weiss' work has been showcased in the Luna Star Café in North Miami and her paintings adorn the walls of the BBC library. 

"You never say you can't do it," Weiss said. "But I'm not going to quit my day job."

Some find it hard to believe that Weiss will no longer work at the library some day.

"I kind of assumed that she would always be here," Kass said. "She's a tremendous asset and a good friend."

Weiss said that she is not going anywhere in the immediate future, when the time comes she will retire. 

"Who knows where you will be 20 years from now," Weiss said.

Headline: Upcoming Flicks: Eclectic October releases to keep audiences in theaters
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
As the temperature outside begins dropping and the days get shorter as summer gives way to fall, the movies that hit theaters this time of year seem to reflect the somber tone of autumn. 

While summer counterparts generally consist of more generally light-hearted fare, the movies that will make way into the multiplexes across America in the coming months will be more serious, as studios look to that coveted Oscar. 

That does not mean there isn't going to be a little something for every type of moviegoer, as there are films for everyone this fall. 

 

The Darjeeling Limited (Oct. 5)



Although another comedy being released on the same day, The Heartbreak Kid, starring Ben Stiller, will likely garner bigger crowds, it is Wes Andersen's fifth film that is more likely to keep critics and audiences alike entertained from beginning to end. 

The Darjeeling stars Owen Wilson,  Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman as three brothers who have grown apart and are brought together by the death of their father. 

They are joined in the cast by Bill Murray, Natalie Portman and Roman Coppola. 

The film centers on the brother's various attempts at growing closer amidst an array of unexpected events. Expect Andersen's trademark wit and subtle humor to make this one of the best comedies of the season.  



Elizabeth: The Golden Age (Oct. 12)

Revisiting the role that gave her an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award, Cate Blanchett returns as Elizabeth I. Clive Owen joins the as Sir Walter Raleigh, who plays a potential love interest for Elizabeth, who has to fight a war abroad, as well as a war at home with the threat of Mary, Queen of the Scots, trying to take her throne. 

The previous Elizabeth film gave way to seven Academy award nominations, and this one may reach that same level of success if the new additions to the cast can live up to their abilities.



We Own The Night (Oct. 12)



Joaquin Phoenix and Marc Wahlberg lead a stellar cast in this crime drama, based in New York City in the late 1980s. 

Phoenix plays the manager of a Russian nightclub, the center of a narcotics ring run by the Russian Mafia, and Wahlberg plays his brother, an NYPD officer who followed in their Deputy Chief father's, Robert Duvall, footsteps in joining the force. When the brothers find out the mafia is planning on taking out their father, they join forces to protect him and take on a Russian gangster, played by Alex Veadov. 



Gone Baby Gone (Oct. 19)



If there is a recurring theme this fall, it is one of star-laden casts, as Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Michelle Monaghan team up with first time director Ben Affleck for this suspense-filled crime thriller based on the acclaimed novel by Dennis Lehane. 

Harris plays one of two detectives who are investigating the mysterious disappearance of a little girl. As they delve deeper into the case, they find themselves risking everything in order to solve it.  



Saw IV  (Oct. 26)



Another year, another Saw movie. Ever since the first in the grisly series debuted three years ago, audiences have been both mesmerized and terrorized, not to mention disgusted, by the films' usage of incredibly graphic scenes of gore and violence, based around various painful and potentially deadly traps designed to test the victim's worth. 

While the last film ended with main antagonist Jigsaw apparently dead from his own designs, don't expect that to be the last you see of him, as there's an all new series of traps waiting for a few unlucky people. 

Also, don't expect a neat ending, as the directors have signed on for two more films following this one.

-The Beacon will feature a movie roundup at the end of each month showcasing the next month's films.

Headline: MANSION NIGHTCLUB PREMIERS DESIGNER'S LINE
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Throwing some of the biggest parties in Miami is like clockwork for Mansion nightclub personnel. Along with catering to the needs of many of Miami's most exclusive, the party epicenter also serves as a venue for designers to show off their latest fashions. 

Monkey enthusiast Paul Frank did just that on Sept. 19, when he unveiled his Spring/Summer 2008 line.

The show began roughly at 1:30 a.m. when the lights went down on a small runway that had been set up in the center of the main dance floor. Even though the music and dancing briefly stopped to start the show, the music choice throughout seemed to make people forget what they had been doing for hours and get into the mood for a fashion show.

Whether as a pattern on the actual clothing or as a plush toy carried by the models, Frank's ever-popular "Julius the Monkey" character made an appearance on many of the ensembles showcased down the catwalk.

Less is more was a theme noted from outfit to outfit, regardless of gender. One male model appeared simply wearing a bluish beach towel below his waist and that was it.

"I was surprised to see a guy wearing nothing but a towel and being considered trendy," said Isabel Moreno, a Mansion regular who had no idea the show was planned for that night. "I had never been there on a Wednesday before. I was not planning on attending a fashion show."

Another male model went back to a time when men were not too scared to show a little leg with his khaki, above-the-knee board shorts. 

Bright, Spring-inspired colors meshed with darker earthier tones as a common ground among models. This combination proved effective, especially since the collection is supposed to satisfy two different seasons.

Mixing the seasons was a hit, but Frank missed when it came to his idea of layering for the beach. Hoodies atop of bikinis and tank tops are not good combinations in Miami's hot, humid summer.

And it's because of that same treacherous summer that Frank's idea of layers for a hot day - as adorable as a hoodie might be - should have stayed as just that: an idea.

The Capri was a highlight of the night, or so Frank thought. The calf-level pant with a pattern of different monkey faces dubbed as both a pajama pant and as a casual piece. 

If casual fashion is what you look for to fit your needs, then Frank's fresh line could be perfect for you.

A night of fashion yes and no's came to an end when all models took one last walk down the runway, some kissing and cuddling with a loveable "Julius"" stuffed animal, proving that despite not doing anything out of the ordinary for fashion, Frank's memorable monkey is what keeps people interested.

"I think I would buy anything with that cute little monkey on it," said Jessica Bermudez, an ex-model who believes Frank's "Julius" cannot and will not do any harm.

Headline: New Act provides more aid
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a tuition payment deadline set for Sept. 21 for the Fall 2007 semester, FIU witnessed 782 students drop their classes last week, mostly due to their inability to supply the proper funding.

But the gray financial cloud that looms over college students just might be lifted with the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 that will take effect in the 2008-2009 academic year. The new legislation, passed by Congress this summer, aims to reduce the federal deficit by $752 million in direct spending on financial aid. 

Although a miniscule percentage of the 38,000 FIU students, these 782, the hardest hit by financial woes, are not alone. With tuition rates rising approximately 6 percent yearly, more students are having difficulty covering their tuition costs and the new act is targeted to help these students. 

With the Act, the federal agenda will significantly benefit the universities' lowest- income students. 

By restructuring where federal money lands, the new act will increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarship by at least $500 over the next five years to a total of a minimum award of $5,200 dollars for the 2012-2013 academic year.

"The most exciting [aspect of the act] is for the Pell Grant recipients, because this means that more direct money will be given to these students," Francisco Valines, the director of financial aid, said. 

FIU will be heavily affected by the act since a total of 38 percent of the student body are Pell Grant recipients. This number will only grow as eligibility requirements, specifically the Expected Family Contribution, will expand to include additional students. 

Middle-class income students should not feel neglected; there are major points in the act that will benefit them too.

The act will come at no additional cost to taxpayers through a move that will cut substantial federal subsidies to lenders. As a result, students who took out loans after July 1, 2006 will see their interest rates decline to 6.8 percent. 

Loans that students take out every subsequent year will have interest rates reduced to 3.4 percent by July 2012. 

For FIU students like Laura Gonzalez, both a Pell Grant recipient and a loan borrower, the Act will make life easier by allowing her to focus on academics.

"[The act] will allow me to use time efficiently. Students need time to study physically and full-time students can. Unfortunately people working full time or part time have less time to concentrate on studies, it's impossible to study at work," Gonzalez said. 

Other important points tied to the legislation include: loan forgiveness for graduates in social sector employment like early childhood educators, law-enforcement, librarians and nurses; income-base repayment of loans; a teaching grant that will disburse money to undergraduate and graduate students majoring in education areas of national need and the containment of college cost through university incentives. 

Promoted by Congress as the "largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill," the College Cost Reduction Act has the potential to become this college generation's most influential act, perhaps to the extent that the GI Bill was to the war veterans of World War II. 

 The Act's importance lies in that it will allow "a university to have quality as well as accessibility. A quality university has to have their need base covered and finances shouldn't impede students from going to a quality university," said Marbely Hernandez, Student Government Council president at University Park.

Headline: CPSC hosts suicide awareness event
Author: Christina Veiga / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Daniel Jordan, a freshman at FIU knows what it's like to be affected by suicide. Jordan had never even met his uncle Wayne before he committed suicide, but the event affected him nonetheless since his family is still coping with the tragedy.

"You don't realize, you think you're an individual, but you have to realize that there are other people who care about you," Jordan said.  

Of all the trends that FIU staff hopes its students won't fall into, increasing suicide rates is on the top of the list. For this reason, FIU's Counseling and Psychological Services Center, with the help of organizations such as the Suicide Awareness Voices of Education and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention will be hosting the first ever Suicide Awareness Walkathon Sept. 29.

According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 10.4 percent, or over 4,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24, committed suicide in 2004, the most recent year data that is available.

That number has been increasing across the United States over the past generation says Seth Grossman, a university psychologist with the Counseling and Psychological Services Center. One reason for the increase could be that there are more stresses now then there were in generations past. 

FIU students may be especially at risk for suicide because the University is a commuter school, making it harder to raise awareness, says Grossman. Compounding that difficulty is the fact that FIU has many non-traditional students who not only deal with the school stresses, but also balance work and family schedules. 

Another factor that Grossman says "certainly plays a role" in student stress at FIU is the fact that the average age of students at the University is 27- higher then most colleges. AFSP reports that 12.7 percent, or over 5,000 young people between the ages of 25 and 34, committed suicide in 2004, which is a higher rate then those between the ages of 15 and 24.

According to Grossman, who is helping to put on the event, the walkathon is a response to a "crisis on campus" across the nation in regards to suicide rates, adding that "we're pretty lucky" to not have had that problem at FIU.

The Suicide Awareness Walkathon will kick off on Saturday Sept. 29 in front of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center at 10 a.m. The event will begin with speakers from CPSC, AFSP, and SAVE. Participants will walk around the perimeter of FIU and the walk will end with refreshments and a community forum held in the Graham Center, room 243 at noon. 

"What we're trying to do is not only create an open dialogue [about suicide] through these events, but to teach people to do this in their own lives," Grossman said.

The forum is meant to educate the public about suicide by discussing suicide signs, suicide prevention and suicide intervention strategies. The forum will also highlight the resources available both on campus and throughout the community for help with dealing with suicide.

Events will continue into the week with a "Journey into the Wild Divine"- a computer relaxation training technique based on biofeedback. The event is free and open for all FIU students. It will take place on Monday Oct. 1 in the University Health Services Complex building, room 270. According to Grossman, participants will watch a computer animated journey that changes based on the feedback obtained through their vital signs, such as heart rate. 

On Tuesday Oct. 2, students can learn to unwind with Anita Sahgal, a university psychologist with CPSC. Sahgal will be hosting a Stress Relief through Meditation event in GC 314 from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. According to Sahgal, the event is meant to be an introduction to the practice of meditation.

"Even people who don't have experience can come learn," Sahgal said. "Anyone can use this because we all have stress in our lives."

Sahgal suggests that students planning to participate in the event bring a mat or towel for the exercises.

The events will culminate Wednesday Oct. 3 with Reel Character Film, an ongoing program with CPSC that uses cinema to raise mental health awareness. The documentary The Truth about Suicide: Real Stories of Depression in College will be shown from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. in UHSC 230. According to Grossman, the movie depicts exactly what people living with depressing and suicidal tendencies go through everyday, Some stories end happily, others end tragically says Grossman.

"It grabs you," Grossman said about the film. "It does a very honest portrayal."

The secondary goal of the event is to help raise money for the organizations helping to put on the event at FIU. Student Government Association and Psychology Advising Leaders have both helped raise money, though Grossman is not sure how much has been made.

But the main goal of the events is to benefit the students of FIU.

Headline: Iran plans to achieve nuclear program legally
Author: Edith M. Lederer / AP Wire
&nbsp;
UNITED NATIONS-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that the issue of Iran's disputed nuclear program is closed as a political issue, and said Tehran will disregard U.N. Security Council resolutions imposed by "arrogant powers" to curb its nuclear program.

Instead, he told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that Iran has decided to pursue the monitoring of its nuclear program "through its appropriate legal path," the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog.

IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei and Iranian officials agreed in July that Tehran would answer questions from agency experts by December on more than two decades of nuclear activity, most of it secret until revealed more than four years ago. 

IAEA technical officials returned to Tehran this week to start probing outstanding questions, some with possible weapons applications.

When Ahmadinejad was ushered to the General Assembly podium to speak, the U.S. delegation walked out, leaving only a low-ranking note-taker to listen to his speech which indirectly accused the U.S. and Israel of human rights violations. Gonzalo Gallegos, a State Department spokesman, said the U.S. wanted "to send him a powerful message."

The Iranian leader spoke hours after French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned the assembly that allowing Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons would be an "unacceptable risk to stability in the region and in the world."

Iran insists that its nuclear program is purely peaceful and aimed solely at producing nuclear energy. But the United States and key European nations believe the program is a cover for Iran's real ambition _ producing nuclear weapons.

Ahmadinejad has defied two U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding that it suspend its uranium enrichment program and imposing escalating sanctions against key figures and organizations involved in the nuclear program. He made clear in his speech that Iran does not intend to comply with them now.

"In the last two years, abusing the Security Council, the arrogant powers have repeatedly accused Iran and even made military threats and imposed illegal sanctions against it," the Iranian leader said.

"Previously, they illegally insisted on politicizing the Iranian nation's nuclear case, but today, because of the resistance of the Iranian nation, the issue is back to the agency, and I officially announce that in our opinion the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has turned into an ordinary agency matter," Ahmadinejad said.

Iran has decided "to pursue the issue through its appropriate legal path ... and to disregard unlawful and political impositions by the arrogant powers," he said.

Speaking to reporters later, Ahmadinejad attempted to clarify Tehran's stance.

"It's closed as a political issue," he said, stressing that it is a legal issue "and therefore should have been examined solely within the framework of the IAEA."

"However, certain big powers ... have made every effort to turn a simple legal issue into a very loud, controversial, political issue," he said.

While Iran is allowing the IAEA to inspect its known nuclear facilities, it no longer allows inspectors freedom to probe deeper and look for suspicious activities on short notice anywhere in the country as it once did.

The U.S. initially opposed the ElBaradei plan, fearing it could draw attention away from Iran's defiance of the Security Council. It later endorsed the plan while emphasizing that Iran must heed the council's demands.

"There will not be peace in the world if the international community falters in the face of the proliferation of nuclear arms," Sarkozy said in his speech Tuesday.

Urging the international community to remain united in responding to "Iran's provocations," she said: 

The world does not have to prove to Iran that Iran is building a nuclear bomb. Iran has to convince the world that it is not striving towards such a bomb."

In an angry defense of Iran, Nicaragua's leftist President Daniel Ortega chastised the U.S. for seeking to restrict the right to enrich uranium, which is allowed under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

Ortega said the United States, as "the only country in the world to have dropped nuclear bombs on innocent people," had no right to question the right of Iran and North Korea to pursue nuclear technology for "peaceful purposes."

"And even if they want nuclear power for purposes that are not peaceful, with what right does (the U.S.) question it?" he told the world leaders.

Headline: Student PantherSoft crew behind MyFIU site
Author: Evelyn Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students get on it every semester, with hopes of seeing their grades, picking their classes or paying for their courses. At FIU, student life revolves around PantherSoft. So one has to wonder, who are the masterminds behind PantherSoft and what do they have in store for students? 

One can find them near ROTC, hidden in a couple of portables, away from the madness of looking for parking or crowds of students. 

Within the PantherSoft facility, 10 developers are FIU students. One of those full-time workers is Developer Eduardo Monteiro, a student working toward his master's in computer science. Monteiro was a software developer for the School of Computing and Information Sciences at FIU during his sophomore year in college. 

"I wanted to work on large-scale systems, that serve thousands of people, but I didn't want to work off-campus because I needed to concentrate on my education. PantherSoft was the best place to be," Monteiro said. He soon became the lead developer for the MyFIU portal. 

The focus that the developers at PantherSoft had in mind for MyFIU was to bring everything that is important in PantherSoft into one single page. 

The process began Oct. 2006 and went live by Feb. 2007; a project estimating to about $180,000 to produce.

According to Vice President & CIO of the Division of Information Technology Min Yao in an email, the funding for MyFIU was provided by the University and the hardware was funded through a joint initiative between University Technology Services, Enrollment Services and the University Graduate School.  The incidental costs were absorbed by UTS Yao said.

Additional financial information was requested and directed to Media Relations by Associate Director Martha Castiello on Sept. 12. Media Relations still did not respond to Castiello by the time of publication, Sept. 25. 

Students seem to be responding to the portal on PantherSoft. Just this month, according to Application Manager John Duran, 44,738 students were on the system, setting a new record. 

However, the most common complaint students have called UTS support for is remembering their passwords. The students are required to change their password every three months. 

"It is annoying that they make you change your password," said Eunice Iniguez.

According to an email from Sean Bossinger, a call center manager with PantherSoft, during July 23 to Aug. 23, which is the lead-up to Fall term, PantherSoft received 9,225 calls.  Of these, 3,930, or 42 percent, were requests for password resets. 

Most students would blame FIU or PantherSoft for this problem, but the fact is that PantherSoft is not responsible; it is done for security reason, which the state requires.

Besides students forgetting their passwords, at times the system is down. Occasionally, this is done purposely. PantherSoft is taking out whatever bugs might be in the program, due to hackers or other reasons. 

Students will soon have to get used to an updated version of PantherSoft. According to Duran, the upgrade will take place by fall of 2008. The company that owns PantherSoft, Oracle, requires the update.    

"MyFIU is a function of the PantherSoft system; we introduced it to students in January 2007 and nothing is changing there. The PantherSoft Student Administration system, which was introduced in 2004, is what is being upgraded. One of the most important reasons for the upgrade is to maintain support from our vendor," said Yao.

According to Duran, students can expect a completely new look and feel for the new system. The upgrade will include improvements for higher education and staffing, financial services. The Student Government Association, according to Division of Student Affairs Melissa Sabatier, will be involved with the update, which is to test and provide feedback.  

The system will be around for a while, so students should just make sure to remember their passwords as PantherSoft keeps evolving.

Headline: FIU students victims of hate crimes
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Four teens were charged with a hate crime and are accused of beating up FIU freshmen Stephen Barrnett, Daniel Cabezas and Chris Eden at Haulover Beach Park Marina on Sunday, Sept. 23 around 2 a.m.

The three Panther Hall residents were on the way back from a keg party on an abandoned island in the middle of the Intracoastal Waterway when racial slurs were hurled at Barrnett, a black student. 

According to Miami-Dade police reports, the three friends were boarding an overcrowded boat to head back to the marina, one teen told Barrnett "to get off the boat, ni----."

Heated words were exchanged but the three friends got off the boat and waited for the next trip to head to shore. 

"The party was kind of boring so we decided to head back to our cars. We didn't' think that anything else would happen," Cabezas told The Beacon.

Upon their arrival at the dock, about 25 men awaited the three friends with baseball bats where they were attacked.

"It was wrong, because he was the only black kid on the island and I'm his friend," Cabezas told The Beacon.

Bal Harbor police said the teens knocked Barrnett out with a bat and tried to drown him in the Intracoastal Waterway. According to police reports, Barrnett suffered head trauma and was taken to the Aventura Hospital.

Eden and Cabezas said Barrnett, suffering from a stiff neck and dizziness, had to get a CAT scan done that night but is currently in stable condition.

While Barrnett was being beaten, Cabezas said he jumped off the dock to avoid a group of men attacking him. 

"I had to [jump in] or they would have killed me," Cabezas told The Beacon.

After jumping into the water, Cabezas said that a fisherman on the pier told him to stand behind him to thwart off the teens. Cabezas said that the fisherman had a gun and flashed it at the teens to keep them from attacking him. 

"At first when I saw the guy go toward Daniel to hit him with the bat, when I grabbed it, all of sudden I was on the ground getting punched and kicked," Eden said. "When I got up I didn't see any of them … it all happened so fast."

Bal Harbor police officer Steve Goldberg was issuing a traffic ticket when someone approached and told him about the fight. Miami-Dade, Sunny Isles and Surfside police arrived on scene soon after.

Eden, who is white and Cabezas who is Hispanic, became friends quickly after moving into the dorms for their first year at FIU. 

Of the five teens arrested, two were charged with hate crime, battery and attempted felony murder: Miguel Aranda, 18, and Gilberto Maakaroun, 17, a North Miami Beach High student.

Nicholas Checa, 15, and Marino Biondini, 17 were charged with a hate crime and battery. 

Jose Osorio, 21, was charged with aggravated battery and attempted felony murder. 

The suspects did not return phone calls despite several attempts.

Headline: President to develop SPC-UP's leadership role
Author: Luis Valdez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Programming Council at University Park has a new president - 20-year-old Sophia Del Zoppo, a senior majoring in advertising, minoring in photography and sister of the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority.

Del Zoppo plans to revolutionize SPC by solidifying its new image of leadership development, quality programming and restructuring its organization.

"[SPC] will start being viewed as an organization anyone that wants the experience and the leadership can join," Del Zoppo said. 

SPC has changed the admission process so that SPC can reach out to more students to get them involved, thus helping them gain more leadership experience through event organizing. 

Del Zoppo also wants to accommodate to FIU students who want to be a part of events they'd like to attend; a goal she is willing to conduct extensive research for. 

"I ran for the SPC presidency because I truly love the SPC and what it stands for and does," Del Zoppo said "I love being able to work for FIU students and bring them good quality fun events."

This year, Del Zoppo was chosen to be the SPC president by its board members, with the normal elections process being forgone. According to SPC advisor "Chinie" Camargo, a taskforce of students from various organizations held a conference to revise and improve the structure of the SPC in May 2007. 

Del Zoppo was the last person to be voted into office as the Special Elections Chair April 2007 and also served as the Films Chair from April 2005 to April 2006.

"I think she is doing an amazing job as SPC president. She really knows how to run it," Camargo said.

Del Zoppo is quickly making a big impression on her fellow SPC members, like Sheska Ocasio.  "I have never had a president be so caring toward her members and be so involved in their perspective organizations," Ocasio said.

Interested students need to fill out an application with at least one letter of recommendation. Resumes are also recommended, though not required. 

The applicant will then be interviewed and, if accepted, are to attend the weekly general meetings at UP.

Those interested in becoming involved with the SPC should visit their office in GC 2304 or visit their website at www.yourspc.com.

MCAT and GPA most important med school admissions factors

According to the Kaplan Testing group, a student's MCAT score and GPA are the most influential aspects when trying to enroll in a medical school. 

Kaplan surveyed 83 of the countries top medical schools. When they were asked which were the most important factors when enrolling, 77 percent believe that an applicant's MCAT score is one of the top two factors in admissions while 34 percent consider it the most important and 43 percent consider it the second most important. 

75 percent believe undergraduate GPA to be one of the top two factors while 39 percent consider it the most important and 36 percent consider it the second most important. 

The survey also revealed that April and January are the most recommended times to take the MCAT.

The exam will be offered 24 times per year between January and September 2008, but space for the test is limited based on the size of the testing site.

Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs found guilty

Warren Steed Jeffs who was accused of being an accomplice to rape by using his religious authority to force a 14-year-old girl into marriage was found guilty on Sept 25. 

Jeffs is president and "prophet" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The group is based towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona and has approximately 10,000 members.

Prosecutors charged that Jeffs pressured Elissa Wall to marry her 19-year-old cousin, despite her objections. 

"When I was young my mother taught me that evil flourishes when good men do nothing," Wall said in an interview with CNN.

Wall was put into in an arranged marriage at 14 by Jeffs. She also commented that the trail was not about religion or a vendetta, but about coming forward about child abuse.

Authorities were worried about possible hostile reactions from Jeffs' followers and placed police sharpshooters on top of nearby buildings  after it was announced the jury had reached a verdict.

Jeffs' conviction could send him to prison for the rest of his life. Sentencing is se to take place Nov. 20. 

Jeffs also faces multiple counts in Arizona of being an accomplice to incest and sex with minors.

Headline: Eyeing Iran: Bush takes aim at Iraq's neighbor
Author: Joseph Marhee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If there's one thing the Bush Administration is good at, it's opening a can of worms before they finish the other. According to CNN.com, recent talks with President George W.. Bush have hinted that an invasion of Iran is imminent, if time allows, before Bush leaves office.

According to former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Bush's prattling about Iran's nuclear ambitions echo the unfounded accusations made of Iraq four years ago. 

"I think the administration, the president and the vice president particularly, are trying to hype the atmosphere, and that is reminiscent of what preceded the war in Iraq," Brzezinski told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer," on Sept. 23.

Back in 2002, Bush told the press that Saddam Hussein's aspirations of procuring Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) had to be thwarted before "final proof- the smoking gun- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud." While his argument would have been sound, had Bush had any real evidence on the matter, it was all speculation without the supporting intelligence to justify such drastic measures.

Bush elaborated on his concerns about Iran earlier this month during a televised news conference alluding to Iraq's purported motives in 2002, "Iran would benefit from the chaos and would be encouraged in its efforts to gain nuclear weapons and dominate the region."

While one could assume that these invasion plans are the result of many months of painstaking research and military intelligence, but many members of the Senate are outspokenly opposed to even planning any sort of action towards Iran before Bush removes the troops from Iraq.

The most outspoken being 2008 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. 

According to a CNN report, Clinton has been adamant about her stand on Iraq and Iran, "I don't believe we should continue to vote for funding that has an open-ended commitment, that has no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the tough political decisions they have to make or which really gives any urgency to the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts."

Clinton has outlined a plan for removing troops from Iraq pending her election. She has also publicly spoken of her plans to "responsibly end the war" within the year, if she is elected.

Bush continues to speak favorably of the United State's work in Iraq and of a "preventative" invasion of Iran which has been complemented by the testimonies of Gen. David Petraeus and U.S Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker. 

Both Petraeus and Crocker have claimed that progress has and will continue to the American emancipation initiative in Iraq and hinted that the time spent there is just the beginning of more growth, seemingly trying to put a good spin on the U.S. occupation. .

While the newly emancipated provinces are certainly improvements from four years ago, it doesn't nearly justify the amount of time the operation has taken. 

We became involved over such a trivial issue, which ended up not being entirely valid, that we almost "forgot" to finish the seemingly legitimate war we started in Afghanistan, reverberating the protests to invading Iran while still occupying both Iraq and Afghanistan. 

The administration has opposition coming from all sides and they still appear to be steadfastly supportive of this war, but one could make the assumption that the administration is afraid to admit either that they were wrong or that they have no idea what to do now besides bring in more and more troops in a fruitless attempt at "liberating" Iraqis.

With any luck in the upcoming election, a withdrawal plan will go into effect and allow us to finish this war and bring our troops home with at least a little less blood on our hands.

Headline: State funds should not finance religion
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Wrtier
&nbsp;
Two publicly-funded schools that recently began operating are causing controversy and forcing a review of the separation of church and state. 

The Ben Gamla Charter School in South Florida and the Khalil Gibran International Academy in New York City have a very unique purpose for schools funded with tax dollars - the study of religion.

The key component of this debate is the actual restrictions placed on the interactions of government and religion by the Constitution.  

A common misconception is that the Constitution provides for the "separation of church and state."  

In reality, the document only specifies that the Legislature cannot pass a law in favor of a specific religion, or condemning another.  	

Despite the fact that the school's official purpose is to teach religion, rather than endorse it, this very thin line has been challenged by critics of both institutions.  

And it is no surprise that the critics of the Arab school and the critics of the Hebrew school are not necessarily from the same end of the political spectrum.  

According to the South  Florida Sun Sentinel, Ben Gamla Charter School was forced to suspend teaching the Hebrew language, due to its inherent ties to religion.  

While this argument is quite ludicrous, as public schools are certainly allowed to teach religion, other points of contention, such as the fact that students had to translate phrases such as "Our Holy Torah is dear to us," may rightfully cause concern.

Attacks against the Khalil Gibran International Academy have been more ethnically charged. The original principal of the school was forced to resign after it was revealed that she was part of an activist group for Muslim women which was selling shirts which said "Intifada  NYC."  

Intifada is commonly associated with violence, though the principal defended it as simply meaning "shaking off."  

An editorial which ran in The New York Sun stated the school was an attempt to appease the group of people responsible for September 11 and would "destroy us again." While such a racially charged attack is not necessarily true nor appropriate, it does appear that these cultural schools are not the best thing for the public system.  

Regardless of whether the schools do or do not endorse a religion, Diane Ravitch, a New York historian quoted in The New York Sun, was correct when she said: "It is not the job of the public schools to teach each ethnic group about its history." 

Until public schools can specifically designate a program for each culture practiced in the country - an impossible ideal that would create thousands of individualized schools - it should leave the study of culture to families - a place where such traditions and practices are better learned in the first place.

This issue points to the larger national trend of America's reversal from being a melting pot to a dinner platter with each food group carefully-separated and not allowed to touch.

Despite these rifts, however, the public school system needs to maintain a mostly unified curriculum and theme which aims to benefit the public good rather than attempting to appease individual groups with divergent interests.  

Ben Gamla Charter School and Khalil Gibran International Academy may not be technically endorsing religions or prohibted by the Constitution but it is inherent that the leaders of these schools will have certain biases towards the culture studied, that the controversy caused by these schools are detracting from the quality and reputation of public education, and that culture is a virtue best studied at home. 

These schools are better left out of the equation.

Headline: Volleyball: No problem opening conference play
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
An impressive 22-7 regular season, capped off by a share of the Sun Belt Conference East Division title, was all it took to put the women's volleyball team on the radar.

Despite the heightened expectations, the tight-knit squad looked more than comfortable sporting the bull's eye on its back Sept. 21-23 in New Orleans. 

The team's 3-0 (30-20, 30-27, 30-12) win over the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin Cajuns on Sept. 23 was the finale to a string of strong performances to open this season's Sun Belt Conference schedule.

"I am very proud of the team, because this was easily one of the toughest weekends in the conference," said coach Danijela Tomic. "To be able to win three games in three days in the fashion that we won them shows that we are physically were we want to be and also that we are mentally tough. We took two matches 3-0, and another one 3-1 so that was impressive."  

Sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa was in explosive form as usual with a team-high 13 kills against the Ragin Cajuns and freshman Ines Medved made it into double figures for the second consecutive game with 11 kills of her own. Freshman setter Natalia Valentin continued to blossom in the Golden Panther offense, delivering a match-high 36 assists to go along with 12 digs. The three-set victory for the Golden Panthers was nothing short of dominant. 

They held the Ragin Cajuns to a dismal -0.68 hitting clip and the 12 points allowed in the final set was the lowest allowed by FIU since the 30-point rally system was implemented six years ago. 

On Sep. 22, the Golden Panthers used somewhat of a different formula against New Orleans, but the result was exactly the same. 

This time around, veteran setter Keila Oliveira orchestrated the offense to a 3-1 (30-23, 21-30, 30-22, 30-24) win. Her match-high 56 assists fueled a balanced attack highlighted by four Golden Panthers in double figures. 

Once again, Rosa led the way with a match-high 20 kills and 10 digs, sophomore Olga Vergun was just two behind Rosa with 18 kills, junior Anita Szymanska came through with a season-high 16 kills and Medved had 13 kills. Junior Mariana Drumeva had a solid performance as well with a match-high 17 digs in the victory. 

In the opener to their weekend marathon, the Golden Panthers made easy work of Louisiana-Monroe with a 3-0 (30-19, 30-14, 30-27) landslide. The always consistent Rosa pounded 13 kills and eight digs. 

Vergun added 11 kills, making good on half of her attempts. Drumeva put her stamp on the game with four aces and a team-best 10 digs. Oliveira added a 34-assist, four-ace performance. 

In all of the games over the weekend, the Golden Panthers came out and set the tone early in the first set, an easy way to stagger the opponents. Early in the season at the Cal Molten Classic in California, it appeared as though some inconsistency from last season had trickled over onto this campaign. But after the team's performance in a tough three-game stretch in three days, it looks like the team is well past the mindset of taking any opponent for granted.

Tomic certainly hopes that is indeed the case and is looking forward to the team's home opener Sept. 28 against Troy. 

"Last year, we always started slow and I thought it took us a while to get in the rhythm of our offense, but so far this year we struggle a bit in the second game," she said. "It seems as if when we win the first set rather easily, we let the team get back in the second game. We are still not as consistent as we would like to be, but it is the first weekend of conference play and we have a long way to go.  

"I can tell you that I am excited and I know our players are excited for the first game at home. It has been a while and I know our fans are excited and can't wait for us to play. I think we have built a nice fan base and we expect a good crowd. The girls work really hard and they get motivated when people come to support them."

&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers (2-2-1) played two well-contested matches against Murray State (5-3) and Stetson (2-3-1) Sept. 21 and 23, respectively, at University Park.

The first game featured little offensive firepower from the Golden Panthers as Murray State defeated FIU 2-1.

A change of game plan in the second game led to more productive offense as the Golden Panthers beat Stetson 2-1 due to more aggressive play.

Francesca Chong injured her right knee against Stetson when a collision led Chong to awkwardly twist her knee. She was helped off the field and remained on the bench as she was later taken away by paramedics.

The next two games are away against Sun Belt Conference opponents Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee.

"We just have to start playing complete games," said coach Thomas Chestnutt. "We're getting back to rhythm after we had huge layoffs, but Stetson was one of the toughest opponents for us this year."



Murray State 2 FIU 1



A defensive miscue by the Golden Panthers led to the Racers Jen Nowak to strike first with a shot from the top of the penalty box for the first score of the game. Nowak was able to separate herself from the defender and had a clear view of the goal.

Throughout the whole game, the Racers applied pressure to the Golden Panthers defense. They were controlling the ball for extended periods of time. As a result of a time possession advantage, the Racers had more opportunities to score. 

Early in the game, the Racers' Renata Figara launched a free kick that missed the goal and hit the crossbar. Opportunities to score were available to the Racers.

On the other hand, the Golden Panthers saw little chances because of their inability to control the ball. The Racers physically bullied the Golden Panthers on offense and defense. 

Freshman forward Claudia Cardenas had a chance to tie the game when she had just one Racer defender behind her. She dribbled the ball towards the penalty box as the goalkeeper began to run towards her. The small window of opportunity to score closed on Cardenas when she hesitated just enough to have the defender and goalie converge on her as they took the ball away.

Murray State would score again when Katie Wilson passed defenders and doubled the score with a shot past goalkeeper Madeline Gannon.

The only offensive score for the Golden Panthers would come late in the contest when freshman midfielder Kassandra Sorzano softly kicked the ball over the head of the Racers goalkeeper.

With only ten minutes left in the game, the Racers defense shut down the Golden Panthers to seal the 2-1 victory.



FIU 2 Stetson 1



Unlike the previous game, the Golden Panthers were the aggressors and played physically against the Hatters from the start. Cardenas, who did not capitalize in a one-on-one matchup with the goalie the previous game, put the Golden Panthers up with a shot from outside the penalty box in the 17th minute.

The rest of the half consisted of defensive struggle and the Golden Panthers led 1-0 to begin the second half. 

In the 58th minute of play, junior midfielder Maria Gauldron passed an accurately placed ball at the feet of Cardenas as she ran toward the goal. 

However, Hatters goalkeeper Andrea Garavgil dove on the ball before Cardenas could shoot. Freshman midfielder Kaley Durrance was passing the ball well throughout the game causing problems for the Hatters' defense. 

The defense denied the Hatters deep entry into Golden Panther territory throughout most of the game. Then, the Hatters' Natalie Simon, who had barely played in the game, scored from the outside in the 82nd minute of play. 

In the second half, the Golden Panthers lost senior midfielder Francesca Chong to a knee injury. With eight minutes left to play, sophomore midfielder Michelle Casadevall crossed the ball to Cardenas as she chipped the ball over the goalkeeper and into the net for her second score of the match. 

"We really wanted to do it for her," Gauldron said.

The last goal demoralized the Hatters as they run out of time to tie the match.

Headline: Commentary: Golden Panthers finish tough stretch, prepare for conference opponents
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It is OK, Golden Panther fans. You can look now. 

The four-game, out-of-conference massacre that begin the season is finally over. 

FIU wasn't expected to win any of their first four games before the 2007 campaign started, but few people expected to see the Golden Panthers give up more than 50 points in half of those games.

The Golden Panthers defense is what keeps games competitive, but they have not been able to hold off sound passing attacks. 

Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing is the latest passer to dissect the Golden Panthers' secondary, as he set the single-game passing record for a sophomore Jayhawk with 368 yards in the 55-3 stomping Sept. 22.

Mental lapses have become routine during the 16-game losing streak, but they have been magnified against tough opponents such as Penn State and Kansas. The Golden Panthers' defense has helped extend opponents' drives letting them record a 50-percent conversion rate on third down. 

Secondary play is usually what allows third down conversions and blown coverage and missed assignments during play have plagued the Golden Panthers. The running defense hasn't been excellent either, but the linebackers' play has not let up despite a corps of newcomers. Michael Dominguez and Scott Bryant have performed well this season. The secondary is the reason no quarterback this season has looked uncomfortable playing against FIU.

So what has happened to the stingy defense from last year?

Well, besides the overwhelming strength of schedule thus far, the offensive struggles have hurt the defense. Three-and-outs and punting so frequently has exhausted the defense to the point where they are drained by the third quarter - the quarter they have given up the most points this season. In addition, the lack of offense has also given opponents good field position to start their drives. 

Quarterback Wayne Younger has struggled, despite his ability to run. His offensive line has not provided enough protection to the inexperienced quarterback. The running attack of A'mod Ned has been formidable, but not enough to relieve pressure off Younger.

But, again, the first four games against the toughest opponents FIU has ever faced are over.

Now, the Golden Panthers' season truly begins against Sun Belt Conference opponents. 

Up to this point, by just looking at statistics and scores, the Golden Panthers are at best just as bad as last year's team. However, fans have yet to see a game that truly gauges the difference between the 2006 and 2007 teams. If the Golden Panthers would've played Penn State and Kansas last year, chances are the results would've been almost exactly the same.

Playing the same conference teams they saw in 2006 allows fans to see if the team has changed from last year. More importantly, playing SBC opponents will not pressure FIU as much as playing against schools with decades of history and excellence. They will not be facing any crowds of excess of 100,000. 

They were playing teams out of their league and now will be playing teams they can match up against. The SBC is the only chance FIU has of breaking the longest active streak in Division 1-A football. The remaining seven games will prove if the Golden Panthers' season was doomed by the first game.

These games will also prove if the Golden Panthers have learned anything from their defeats this season. This is the most critical juncture of the season. If the Golden Panthers manage to rectify their season by winning against SBC opponents, then it will be the first tangible sign that FIU has a chance of turning around the program in the next few years. 

However, if the Golden Panthers continue to struggle, then the immense losses were for naught and they will have trouble convincing fans they will be improving in the upcoming years.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Rain delays factor outcome of weekend homestand
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For men's soccer, the two-game home series Sept. 21 and 23 at University Park was marred by rain and the inability to record the elusive first win.

The Golden Panthers (0-6-2) produced their best offensive output against the University of Illinois-Chicago Flames (3-1-2) recording a season-high two goals, but it wasn't enough to win as the Flames battled back on the wet field to tie.

FIU played against Navy Midshippmen (4-1-1) in the second game of the series in which it lost 3-1 despite nearly tying the game in the last five minutes of the game.

First string goalkeeper junior Kyle Thomas did not start either game due to injury, so junior Michael Anderson played in his place.



FIU 2, UIC 2 (2OT)



The first 12 minutes of the game, the Golden Panthers scored as many goals as they had in their previous six games combined. University of Illinois-Chicago midfielder Baggio Husidic was ousted 26 seconds into the game for a hard foul. The Golden Panthers smelled blood and pounced on the under-manned team.

Sophomore midfielder Juan Guerra got the scoring underway in the 6th minute of play by passing the Flames' defense to have an open shot near the top of the penalty box. The one-on-one battle resulted in Guerra's second collegiate goal.

Six minutes following Guerra's goal, junior midfielder Levi Coleman set up Guerra outside the penalty box, who beat the goalie again for his second goal of the match.  

This was the first time in which the Golden Panthers led at any point in a match against any opponent this season.

The 2-0 lead was cut in half when the Flames' Charlie Tout dribbled past the Golden Panther defense and blasted a goal from the right side of the penalty box in the 31st minute. 

The Flames adjusted to being outnumbered and evened out the contest in injury time with Powel Ligas crossing the ball to Charlie Tout on the right side of the penalty box, scoring his second goal of the match.

At this point, the two teams were evenly matched even though the Flames were playing with ten players. Then the game was delayed as the lights went out at University Park in the 54th minute.

After the four combined goals in the first half, the defenses would not allow another score for the rest of the game. Junior midfielder Bruno Barbosa's free-kick was the Golden Panthers' only real scoring threat as the two teams ended in a 2-2 tie.



Navy 3, FIU 1



During the first seven minutes of play, the Golden Panthers almost duplicated their offensive success from last game with Levi Coleman passing the ball to Juan Guerra who nearly scored his third goal of the weekend before Navy goalkeeper Thomas Jenkins kept the game scoreless with a diving save. 

Following the save, another rain delay halted the Golden Panthers' game, except this time the lights would not go out against the Midshippmen. 

After the hour-long delay, the Midshippmen got on the board in the 16th minute of play when Mark Garcia facilitated the offense by passing the ball to Chris Schneider, who made the goal outside the penalty box. 

In the 29th minute of play, Steven Jair Cabas crossed the ball to Coleman deep in the penalty box as he tied the game with a header.

Coleman then nearly put the Golden Panthers up with another header set up by Guerra, but the ball sailed wide to the left.

The Golden Panthers near-score was followed by an actual score when Midshippmen Andrew Garcia sped by the FIU defense and took on goalkeeper Michael Anderson one-on-one to give Navy a 2-1 lead.

With less than five minutes left in the match, the Golden Panthers were threatening in Midshippmen territory. Cabas fired a cannon shot from the left side of the field that would've tied the game but Jenkins made another critical save.

With the Golden Panther defenders pushed forward Navy crossed the ball behind them to Andrew Garcia, who ended the game 3-1.

Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers will take on Middle Tennessee State, the reigning Sun Belt Conference Champion, Sept. 29 at Murfreesboro, Tenn.

Unlike FIU's first four match-ups, this time they will be taking on a team with a losing record. 

Middle Tennessee and FIU are both 0-4 and someone will leave the field with their first win.  

Coming off a 55-3 loss to Kansas, FIU had a few positives it will need to expand upon in order to beat the Blue Raiders. 

Last week, quarterback Wayne Younger put up his best numbers this season when he passed for 133 yards on 16 completions.

Freshmen wide receiver Jason Frierson had four catches for 47 yards. 

FIU's receiving core is made up mostly of underclassmen; right now, FIU's leading receivers - Frierson, Trenard Turner and Greg Ellingson - are all freshmen. 

This season, the Golden Panther defense has given up an average of 40.7 points per game. They've been hurt mostly in the secondary by teams with high-powered passing games. 

Middle Tennessee has a good passing game led by junior quarterback, Joe Craddock who has passed for 548 yards this season. 

 The Blue Raiders also have a strong rushing attack with running backs DeMarco McNair and Phillip Tanner, who have combined to rush for 282 yards and six touchdowns this season. 

Middle Tennessee will be the first Sun Belt Conference team FIU plays and, with the exception of the Oct. 27 meeting with the Arkansas Razorbacks, all of the Golden Panthers remaining games will be against SBC opponents. 

If FIU can win the Sun Belt Conference, they will receive a bid in a bowl game at the end of the year. 

"They are an excellent football team and always vying for the conference championship and we got a heck of a challenge," said head coach Mario Cristobal on facing the Blue Raiders. 

Despite the 0-4 record, MTSU should not be taken lightly. They only suffered one shutout loss and that was at the hands of No. 2 Louisiana State.

The Golden Panthers are facing a team that put up 42 points against No. 8 Louisville on national television. They allowed 58 points, but the Golden Panthers offense will most likely not produce that type of offensive production.

Headline: Commentary: Women's soccer faces season's defining moment
Author: Ryan Abbey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There was one player who sent out the biggest message on the field Sept. 23 as the women's soccer team took on Stetson University. She was on the bench most of the second half. 

She didn't score, assist or even suggest a formation change. Nor did she even speak English when she challenged her team.  

Despite all of that, senior midfielder Francesca Chong gave her team the ultimate boost in the 52nd minute of the game when she made an ill-advised challenge, went down, and couldn't even come back up under her own power several minutes later.

The language she was speaking? It was a language athletes hope they never learn to speak: pure pain.

No matter what sport you may play that translates loud and clear to everybody and the fans even cringed as she lay there on the pitch. 

As she screamed in agony, her teammates were taking a water break and wondering what was going to happen to their teammate. One question most likely ran through all of their minds: "How are we going to respond to this?" 

Good question, because when a teammate gets taken out of the game there must be some kind of renewed vigor when you step onto the field. So it's about 12 minutes later, the Golden Panthers are taking the field once again. 

For about the next 12-15 minutes of the game, the team was playing decent soccer, but it wasn't really flowing much at all. There was a stretch where much of the passing was of the one-touch, spastic nature, which gave Stetson some opportunities. 

The defense regained its composure first and provided a cushion, while the attacking third overcame the mental hump from Chong's injury.

After this brief lapse, the talking became louder, passing was cleaner and the spacing was spreading the Stetson defense - providing multiple chances and making this a game to really watch once again.

Of course, Stetson did what all good teams should do - they fought back. With both teams slugging it out, the midfield became a battlefield (which didn't really do well for the pitch; the wing right above the midfield was worn out by rain). 

At the 82nd minute Stetson broke through, tied the game and put the Golden Panthers in another difficult position. This time though there was no room for thinking, but there was enough time for another goal. 

Freshman forward Claudia Cardenas stepped up in the 87th minute and made a picture-perfect goal, which wasn't the flashy bullet into the upper 90, but a lofty chip shot that sailed into the back of the net. 

That was enough to seal the game.

So everything worked out well in the end, right? On paper everything did. Winning is the best deodorant. It covers a multitude of short-comings and can give pride to even the ugliest wins. However, Chong's injury will require season-ending surgery and end her career as a Golden Panther. 

The game could've definitely gone the other way because up until that 52nd minute, FIU didn't look like it was attacking for that all-important insurance policy and missed many chances throughout the game. 

If I had to give a rating through the first five games of the season, I would definitely give this team a "good." Responding in a very positive fashion and having a freshman with her first multi-goal game in her college career all merits a "good," for sure.  

With more efforts like this, fans can be sure that this team won't be called 'the best team you've never heard of.'

Women's Tennis



The women's tennis team started off the season successfully with a strong showing at the Gator Fall Classic in Gainesville, Sept. 21-23. The team looked strong, as they took matches from the North Florida, South Florida, and No. 7 Florida.

The weekend began with freshman Liset Brito, the 2006 4A Florida individual State Champion as a senior at Miami Senior High School, making an impressive debut. 

She teamed with senior Egle Petrauskaite to take down North Florida's team of Natalia Sanchez and Victoria Krook by a score of 8-2. 

Brito then took down the No. 106 collegian, Whitney Benik of Florida. Brito fell behind in the first game, but rallied back to defeat Benik 5-7, 6-2, 1-0 (11-9).

FIU also received a doubles victory from the sophomore team of Priscilla Castro and Maria Pazo, who defeated North Florida's Maria Melihova and Vanessa Sanchez.

In singles, however, the team was not as successful as they dropped 4 out of 5 matches on Friday, with Brito being the only player who was able to grab victory.

On Saturday, Sept. 22, Brito and Petrauskaite again had a good day, upsetting UF's 7th ranked team of Csilla Borsanyi and Diana Srebrovic by a score of 8-5. 

Unfortunately, the Golden Panthers other doubles teams did not fair as well against UF's powerful squad as Castro and Pazo fell to the 52nd ranked pair in the nation and senior Marijana Cutuk and sophomore Maria Jose Vallasciani lost to the 31st ranked pair. 

In singles, FIU took 3-of-5 matches from USF.

The weekend ended with Brito and Petrauskaite again overpowering their opponents, this time over USF's Liz Cruz and Iciri Rai, by a score of 8-3. In showing their dominance this weekend, the pair moved up to the No. 41 ranking in the country.

The Golden Panthers split six matches with UNF later on in the day, finishing up a solid weekend for the squad overall.



Men's Basketball



The men's basketball team released its 2007-08 schedule Sept. 25 with one of the highlights being a seven-game home stand to open the season. 

Beginning on Nov. 12 against Florida Tech, the team will take on Kennesaw State, South Florida, Robert Morris, Florida Gulf Coast, Buffalo and Miami in front of the home crowd at Pharmed Arena. 

Following the final game of the home stand Dec. 8, the team will have a week off for fall semester exams before opening conference play on the road at Arkansas-Little Rock and Middle Tennesse State. 

After that short road swing, they return home to take on 2006 NCAA Final Four participant George Mason before taking on Purdue and Kentucky in back-to-back road games.

The season features 17 home games for the team, the most in school history. 

With Miami, USF, and George Mason traveling to Pharmed, the team expects good crowds to turn out to watch the Golden Panthers take on these competitive teams.

Headline: First half dooms Golden Panthers
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU Golden Panthers (0-5) were on the receiving end of a resonating 47-6 defeat Saturday night at the hands of the Middle Tennessee State University Blue Raiders (1-4).

The Blue Raiders struck swiftly from the opening kickoff, marching down the field with overwhelming efficiency as quarterback Dwight Dasher sliced apart the FIU offense with both his legs and arm in an effort that culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass to Desmond Gee.

FIU proceeded to go three and out as the teams exchanged punts, but Middle Tennessee scored on a 24-yard sprint by Dasher. The Blue Raiders would then score on every possession leading up to halftime.

The Golden Panthers punted again, and this time it would be Dasher's scrambling ability that doomed the FIU defense. He twice avoided what seemed like certain sacks to pick up 19 and 11 yards on consecutive plays and finished off the drive with a 27-yard strike to put the Blue Raiders up by 21.

FIU picked up one of its two first downs after the ensuing kickoff, but after punting the ball, Dasher completed a 71-yard touchdown pass to DeMarco McNair on a screen in which he broke off several attempted tackles and stepped into the endzone with no Golden Panthers within 20 yards. 

Punter Chris Cook mishandled a high snap and was forced to roll out having a desperation left footed kick blocked for a safety as FIU continued to fail in every facet of the game.

Dasher proceeded to drive the Blue 
Raiders down to the FIU 1-yard line, which led to a naked bootleg that ended with Dasher walking into the endzone untouched and unnoticed as the entire defense collapsed on the middle.

Quarterback Wayne Younger threw an interception on the next possession that led to a MTS touchdown and a field goal on the Blue Raider's final possession of the first half that put them up by 47. As the players finally retreated to the locker rooms, the game was out of reach.

Most of Middle Tennessee's starting offense was replaced upon the start of an uneventful second half, highlighted by a blocked punt that culminated in the lone Golden Panther touchdown of the night.

All three of FIU quarterbacks saw action, and all failed to substantiate any semblance of production. The quarterbacks were not the sole reason the offense struggled as the Blue Raider defensive line continually penetrated the line of scrimmage and provided no opportunities for the offense to develop synchronization. 

Freshman quarterback Dasher's ability to shrug off Golden Panther defenders with ease throughout the course of the game put the Blue Raiders up early, and they never looked back.

The 47 points scored in the first two quarters are the most ever allowed by FIU in a single half.

The Golden Panthers have now been outscored 210-28 through five losses this season.
