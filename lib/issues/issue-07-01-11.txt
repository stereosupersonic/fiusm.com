Headline: Winning comes at an expensive price for students
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
2007 brings on a new year and greater expenses ... I mean expectations, sorry.

Welcome to your new home, Mario Cristobal, and good luck.

You are inheriting the youngest program in all of Division I-A football - a team that made the fastest transition there in college football history. You look on as another Florida school crowns themselves national champions and you dream of what it would be like.

What a program to compare to, with an age difference of just 95 years, two national championships and give or take $62 million dollars in athletic budget. It's tough to compete with the best, huh?

The main difference, however, is not all the silverware or even the tradition. Or is it? 

Tradition may have a lot to do with it - after all it's the alumni that are feeding the Gators, not the students.

According to the Miami Herald, the Gators spend 78.2 million dollars a year on sports; it's brought them two major national championships in less than a year, in football and basketball. Yet the students only supply about $2.5 million into that winning budget, a hair past 3%. Impressive. 

At FIU, the struggling new boys that find themselves in a time of change have had to heavily rely on their students and that's something that I cannot come to grips with. The students have stepped up to the plate willingly and opened their checkbooks wide.

The Golden Panthers' budget for 2007 will be close to $16 million, feeding mostly the large appetite of the football program, the construction of its new stadium.

Stadiums don't come cheap - $54 million is the estimate on that piece of real estate. Hopefully the Carnival Center folks aren't doing the math.

Of that estimated $16 million, an unbelievable 81.25% comes directly from student fees. Any math majors out there? I'm terrible at math but my phone's calculator is quite good and it says that's $13 million.

The price one pays for school pride. Impressive.

So why is it that no one cares about this football program? Or women's basketball coach Cindy Russo and her 600 plus wins and the money that we supply her and her staff, for that matter? Who uses our hard earned cash?

Why is it that whenever I find myself at any of these events, I look around and see the same faces and the same small crowds? 

Let's not be misled. If you check the stats on fiusports.com on a regular basis, and who doesn't, football is bringing in almost 17,000 people a game. Luckily, I have a media pass or I'd never get in.

Anyone that reads this column, if anyone really does, knows that even half that number (get out your trusted calculator again) would be far fetched. Take away the number of fans that travel with the opposing team and the figure shrinks even more. So why is it that students that pay almost $185 a semester on student fees (times two on the calculator for the full year) don't even want to see if their investment is pulling its weight? If you bought a house would you not live in it? 

It could be that Miami, by nature, roots for teams that win (if anyone disagrees with that statement, feel free to write me a letter, postcard, email, text message or MySpace comment as soon as possible, so that I can inform you of your need for professional help).

Case-in-point: the 1997 and 2003 Florida Marlins, who saw outstanding attendance numbers from 1998-2002 and 2004-present.

Just last season, the Miami Heat felt this fan euphoria when everyone claimed to support the team and cheered just as loudly as they did in that fabulous 2002-2003 season.

The list goes on and on.

So it is no surprise that FIU sees horrific attendance numbers; the quality is not on par with the average Miamian's standards. 

Fine. I can live with that, except for the little fact we talked about above: FIU students are paying up front for the product on the field, court, diamond, trampoline, etc. 

I can understand not wanting to shell out $60-$200 to take your lady friend to a Heat or Dolphins game. She won't enjoy it the same way you or I might. But at FIU you already paid, so why not go out to one game?

Just try it out. If you like it, come back for more. 

After all, you get in for free. The students voted in favor of the increase in money because they want to see their school on a map, so stop complaining about it and come out and watch a game.

Without the support of the student-fans and donations from alumni, the athletic program will never reach a high level. 

Worst of all, students will continue to pay outrageous amounts of money every semester for teams that have no one cheering for them.

It's hard to win when no one's in the stands. After all, it's not like some big time boosters fronted all the monies - you did.

Headline: Men's basketball fails to halt losing streak
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After dropping its first game of the New Year, the men's basketball team was eager to win against Louisiana-Lafayette Jan. 6.

However, the young team seemed anything but desperate to win as a mediocre first half performance resulted in a slim 74-71 loss on the road to its Sun Belt Conference foe. 

With the win, the Ragin' Cajuns improved to 4-12 on the season, while the Golden Panthers fell to 6-9 and continue on a four-game losing streak.

Even in disappointment, there were a few bright spots for the Golden Panthers as senior guard Johwen Villegas had a game-high 25-points, while Alex Galindo gave arguably his best performance of the year, picking up his third double-double with 23 points and 13 rebounds.

The Golden Panthers opened the game shooting a dismal 8-for-25 from the field and were out rebounded 23-14 in the first half.

"You can't score 20-points in a half of a college basketball game on the road and expect to win," coach Sergio Rouco said. 

Heading into the second half, the Golden Panthers knew that things had to get better because, despite their poor play, they trailed the Raging Cajuns by eleven, 31-20.

The scoring punch for the Ragin' Cajuns was coming from a familiar name, Ross Mouton. The senior, who has been on an offensive tear of late, had 12 first half points, while connecting on 4-of-6 attempts from beyond the arc. 

After making good on just 1-of-11 3-ponit attempts in the first half, Villegas caught fire as he poured in 5-of-7 3-pointers, which led the way to a 20-point half. 

Following Villegas' lead, Galindo had 16 points and 10 rebounds in the second half.

Despite the offensive display from Villegas and Galindo, the Ragin' Cajuns still held a 61-50 edge, with 3:50 remaining. Sensing their chances for a comeback slipping away, the Golden Panthers turned up their defensive intensity and a series of long bombs from Villegas and Galindo pulled the Golden Panthers within a single point 72-71 with just 6.8 seconds remaining. 

On the other end, defensive specialist Chris Fuller committed a foul on ULL junior David Dees, who calmly sank two free throws to secure the 74-71 win. After Mouton carried the bulk of the offensive load in the opening half, it was Dees who went off in the second. The feisty guard put up 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting from the field to help his team win. Mouton finished with a team-high 22 points. Dees added a double-double with 18 points and 10 boards. 

Despite a costly turnover in the waning moments of the game, Fuller was instrumental in the comeback attempt for the Golden Panthers as he scored all of his 11 points in the second half.

"We came back and Chris [Fuller] gave us a great spark in the second half coming off the bench," coach Rouco said.

For the Golden Panthers, the loss was just another in a series of tough contest. It all started with a heartbreaking 68-66 loss to Sun Belt foes Florida Atlantic Dec. 28. In that game FAU's Deandre Rice swished a 3-pointer with just 5.9 seconds left to lock up a 68-66 win. 

Following that loss, a big Middle Tennessee squad had their way with the Golden Panthers on New Year's Eve as the Blue Raider duo of Kevin Kamaskie and Desmond Yakes put up 13 points each on FIU.

"I'm not happy with the loss. We've got to do a better job of making the easy baskets," coach Rouco said.

In FIU's first game of 2007, South Alabama also jumped out to an early lead on the Golden Panthers and ran away with a 69-52 win Jan. 4. 

With the results of that tough road trip dwelling in their minds, the Golden Panthers will look to turn it all around with some much needed home cooking.

Their three-game home stand against Sun Belt opponents will begin Jan. 11 against Western Kentucky. They will then  face Denver Jan. 13 and North Texas Jan. 18. Tip off for all three games is set for 7:30 p.m.

Headline: Editorial: Other things more important than new schedule's name
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The committee charged with implementing FIU's upcoming schedule change held its first meeting of the year on Jan 5. Part of the meeting was spent picking out an official name for the new schedule. 

Any marketing consultant worth his salt knows that coming up with the right name is an essential part of launching a successful product.

The members of the implementation committee must be confused, however, because the job they have been charged with is getting a new University policy working and off the ground, not launching a new product line. 

For one thing, in changing the class schedule, the administration is not selling anything. 

A spiffy new product needs a nifty-sounding name to get it off the shelves. People are more likely to make a certain choice - that is, to buy a product - if that product's name sounds cool.

For better or for worse, with the new class schedule, we don't have a choice. With or without our support, Monday/Wednesday/Friday classes are coming and they're here to stay.

Which is fine. It just prompts the question of why such a fuss was made about the name.

If students could pick between the current schedule and the new one, and University administrators were trying to promote the newer option, it would make sense to give it a catchy name. It would motivate students to consider it.

The way things stand right now, however, come next semester, we will all be following a new class schedule no matter what the schedule is called.

Granted, some committee members had valid reasons for renaming the new schedule.

For example, Terry Witherell, head of the committee's communication division, pointed out that the term "three-day schedule" doesn't reflect other adjustments that are being made.

It does bear mentioning that some of these adjustments are undoubtedly positive: we are getting more high-tech classrooms with the bargain, and if things go according to plan, the change might make students' schedules more convenient in the long run.

Still, calling it the "super high-tech classroom convenience schedule" would be disingenuous. The main thrust behind the change is that Monday/Wednesday classes will now also meet on Fridays. That's why people started calling it the three-day schedule.

Given all this, the implementation committee would do well in sticking to its task, which is to make sure that the transition process goes as smoothly as possible.

This is going to be a somewhat difficult and complicated process, and there are far more important things to take care of other than public relations and image management.

Besides, most students - and professors - would agree that there is no label that the committee could come up with that can make a class on Friday sound appealing. 

Shakespeare said in Romeo and Juliet that a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet.

A new class schedule is a new class schedule, no matter what you call it.

Headline: Video games not responsible for nation's ills
Author: Ricky Dominguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Video game censorship is a major issue being discussed by schools, community activists and even Congress. Is the violence committed by children inspired by the amount of violence contained in the video games they play? Some think so. 

Late last year, the ill fated 109th congress passed C.A.M.R.A., the Children and Media Research Act, a new law that would create a $90 million commission to investigate the negative impact of video games on the children of America.

Senator Joe Lieberman, one of the sponsors of C.A.M.R.A., has often complained that video games are much too violent and should be censored for the benefit of the people. The first amendment of the Constitution states that as citizens of the United States we have both the freedom of speech and of the press, meaning that you can put anything on whatever medium and distribute it to the public.

 Video games can influence the behavior of an individual, but it doesn't mean that they should be blamed when a person commits a heinous crime. Any person with a grasp of reality can control their actions, however inspired or influenced by interactive media. If someone wants to go to the streets and shoot a bunch of people, then it's their prerogative to do so. 

Video games have different ratings for a reason, ranging from E (All Ages) to AO (Adults Only).

Player discretion has always been advised by the companies who make video games, it's just up to the buyer to follow these guidelines.

Store clerks are not supposed to be selling M-Rated (Mature Themed) games to underage kids or face losing their job.

The companies that make and market these games do their best to make sure that the proper audience uses their products. Some game developers have even gone as far as to post warnings of violence and gore and other mature themes which appear whenever the game is played on its corresponding gaming console. 

Once a game is out on the streets then it's all in the consumer's hand.

Parents should be involved in what their children purchase to make sure that they're not playing something that is too violent for their age.

While things such as racism, drugs, sex, violence and vulgar language exist in video games, there is no reason why they would force someone to go out into the street and commit random acts of violence to mimic the characters.

People should start taking responsibility for their actions, and stop blaming video games for their mistakes.

Headline: COMING SOON?: Smog to smother South Florida skies
Author: Denzel D. Burnside III / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Wow," is what I say every time I take in the beauty of Los Angeles. If you ever get the opportunity to travel to Southern California, you may ask yourself: is the smog as thick as portrayed in movies, and on TV?   

Unfortunately, the air is just that bad, according to recent studies conducted by the UCLA Institute of Environment.

In its ninth annual Southern California Environment Report Card, it revealed that the film and TV industry in California is a significant contributor to "America's dirtiest skies." 

According to a study prepared by L.A.'s Integrated Waste Management Board, the television and film businesses produce more air pollution than the hotel, apparel and aerospace industries combined. The entertainment industry actually ranks third in greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.

The concern for air pollution in Southern California draws minimal concern for those living in other regions of the country. However, with many productions being moved from Hollywood to other cities including Miami, it is in our best interest to ask how the film industry might negatively affect the environment.

The reasons behind Hollywood's pollution-producing behavior are many but easily identifiable. The report noted, for instance, that dozens of contractors with different practices work on a single set, making it tough to regulate. 

Mary Nichols, director of the UCLA Institute, said in an interview with the Christian Science Monitor that the structure of the movie industry and the competitiveness that characterizes it do not encourage eco-friendliness. 

However, officials caution against additional regulations which they feel could push the entertainment industry out of California and maybe into our very own backyard.

Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., cautioned in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that additional regulations could drive more movies and T.V. productions elsewhere

"There would be a risk because you have other states out there quite anxious to get a piece of the film industry," he said.  

The TV and film production industry employs 252,000 people in the Greater Los Angeles area and generating $29 billion in annual revenue, economic benefits that would be welcomed by any city with a struggling economy. 

Several business owners in Miami would welcome the entertainment industry such as Franco Carcetti, who owns ABC Costume Shop in Miami's Design District. 

''Every commercial that's shot in town, they come here to take something,'' Carretti said in an interview with The Miami Herald.

 Miami already has been flagged as the premiere music video location and been the setting of movies like Bad Boys II, and Miami Vice,  and film festivals like the American Black Film Festival and the International Film Festival.

If this is the trend, we will definitely see more productions in the future.

Economically, the city may welcome the opportunities, but it must remain vigilant over the industry to avoid the pollution it may bring.

Headline: FILL 'ER UP: Local stations offer commuters lower prices
Author: Jose Pagliery / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Suzy Rainsberger, a sophomore who lives along the western stretch of Kendall Drive, switched her Ford Explorer for the new Scion XB when the large SUV began to guzzle gas at a rate of $100 a week. Her combined savings may total $636 just this year.

"It's better to pay $300 a month for a new car than $400 for gas," she said.

Despite the ever-existing problem of high gas prices, FIU students may be profiting from lower prices near University Park. A recent Beacon analysis of gas prices along a five-mile stretch down 107th Avenue shows a dip in price near both FIU and Bird Road. Students who fill up a small tank with regular gasoline once a week may be able to save up to $100 over the course of the year - simply by picking the right gas station.

"I would do it," said Clara Scutt, a senior who drives her Honda Civic from her home by Metrozoo to FIU everyday. "[I'd] put that money towards my credit card bills."

The analysis concludes that gas prices acrosss 107th street are higher and mathed north of NW 14th street, but show a decrease south of this street, closer to FIU. Prices then increase rapidly as the stations get closer to Doral and Kendall. Also evident is the tendency to create unorganized price fixing, where adjacent gas stations compete, conjointly fluctuating their prices. Areas like Doral, Pinecrest and Miami Beach are no strangers to this sort of regional price control. The graph (page 2) reflects some of these findings.

The analysis also shows that Westar, located on Bird Road and 107th avenue, serves the most inexpensive gas, beating the Chevron located at 72 NW st. by two cents for every octane level. By comparison, the Mobil station down on the same avenue, located on NW 58th street, charges 20 cents more for regular, and 16 cents more for mid-grade and premium. Even students who drive small Hondas or Mitsubishis can save $100 dollars a year by filling their tanks at the right gas station; those who drive large trucks may be able to save $120 or more.

The most expensive gas station on the study is the Mobil station located at NW 58th street. Also important to mention is the BP station located at SW 32nd street, which outstands from the other gas stations nearby because of its higher rates.

Senior Danny Matos, son of an auto-parts vendor who grew up at his father's Hialeah warehouse, warns that octane ratings don't say it all. 

"Gas might last a little bit longer, but it's really not worth the price," Matos said.

Because UP students already drive to or from campus, the cheaper gas stations are not out of the way. For students who head southbound on 107th Avenue, the above-mentioned Westar may be their preferred pit stop; for those who head up north, the Shell on SW 8th Street might do the trick. However, this station is not to be confused with the Shell located directly in front of UP's main entrance, which charges four cents more than local stations.

Headline: Student apprehends purse thief at UP
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On Jan. 9 a student at the School of Architecture Building apprehended a purse-snatcher.

"A friend of mine said her purse was missing," said junior Tyler Crain who apprehended the suspect. "Then some of my other friends said they saw a suspicious looking guy with a black backpack. I looked behind me and my black backpack was gone."

A few minutes later Crain spotted the suspect and confronted him.

"The guy said it was his backpack, but I opened it up and saw all of my stuff with some of his thrown on top," Crain said. "I said we would wait for the police to decide."

Crain forcibly held the suspect and waited for Public Safety officers to arrive.

The suspect was placed under arrest.

Public Safety officers present stated they could not release any information until the investigation was completed, including the suspect's name.

"You feel so violated after something like this," said junior Alison Robbins, the student whose purse went missing.

After the suspect was caught, neither the purse or its contents were found.

"[Theft] happens more often than we would like," said Nathaniel Belcher, director of the School of Architecture. "We have panic buttons and other means for students to contact Public Safety in these kinds of situations."

Like many other buildings at UP (such as the Graham Center and the art trailers), the School of Architecture building is opened 24 hours, according to junior Felipe Aldana.

"We pull all-nighters a lot," Aldana said. "Even glue gets stolen."

Headline: Dropping classes: the pros and cons
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It was her fifth time taking Approaches to Literature (ENG 2012), a student announced in professor Althea Silvera's class last Fall semester. Even though the student seemed determined to pass this time, she began missing classes after the first weeks. She even disappeared for some time, although according to Silvera, she saw the student many times on the passing. So many missed classes resulted in the student earning an F.

"She came back towards the end of the semester with make up work but she did not turn in the final paper and I had to fail her anyways," Silvera said.

Dropping a class is not always the best solution, and advisors suggest seeking advice, tutoring and talking with professors before doing so. However, when there are little chances of passing, or work and other responsibilities interfere with the completion of course requirements, dropping a class is a an option that doesn't affect the GPA.

 "When students start college they tend to work around 15 to 20 hours," said Valeria Johnsen, director of academic advising. "Then they start working more and more. Work tends to be the first reason why students drop classes."

Such was the case for sophomore Paola Torres, who dropped a class once because she did not have enough time to complete the assignments. She now works at the Panther Stop shop, which she believes is a great option because working on campus allows for greater flexibility when it comes to the hours she needs to work. 

"I thank God that I'm good at math. I feel bad for the other students who end up dropping math classes," Torres said. "I've been in a class of 50 students at the start of a semester and ended with a class of 12."

According to Johnsen, math courses are the most dropped classes at FIU. 

However, dropping classes is a double-edged sword that many students are simply unaware off. 

The obvious benefit to dropping a class is the fact that it will not directly affect a student's GPA. If a class is dropped after the first week of class then the student will receive a DR (standing for dropped) grade. That DR grade only counts to the number of credits attempted that semester and not the overall GPA. 

There are also consequences to dropping classes, including financial ramifications.

The first week of classes is meant for students to see if they like the class they selected and give them enough time to drop it, if need be, without any consequences. Students only receive full refunds for dropped classes if they drop their class by Jan. 16. If a student misses that deadline, they can still drop classes by March 12 to receive a DR grade but no refund.  

Also, during a student's third attempt at taking a class, the tuition for that class increases with the $161.70 per credit repeat surcharge. So the normal three-credit class would go from  $312.99 to $798.09  (Figures based on the Fall 2006 - Summer 2007 Tuition per credit chart available at www.fiu.edu/~cashiers). 

While dropping a class may be a temporary relief, dropping too many classes could have serious consequences.

"There are financial aid issues," Johnsen said. "If you drop below the required number of courses a semester, your scholarship could be in jeopardy."

With some insurance policies, students may remain on their parents' plan as long as they are full-time students. This varies depending on the many different insurance policies, but Johnsen urges students to keep this in mind when they are dropping classes.

There are several alternatives to dropping classes, according to Johnsen.

"Early in the semester students should talk to their instructor," Johnsen said. "They may be able to give you further instruction or help guide you in the right direction. Students can also take advantage of the many tutoring services at FIU."

Early is the key to success according to Johnsen. Students should not seek out tutors the day before an exam but as early as possible to ensure the student can absorb and understand the material being taught in class.

"Tutoring should be seen as a way to achieve excellence," Johnsen said.  

The Student Learning Center is located in Primera Casa room 247. There, students can request student tutors in many different courses. Students already into their major can also check their own college's advising programs. 

Silvera also suggests students should look at the times of their selected courses and be true to whether or not they can wake up on time for the early morning classes as sleeping in too many times could cost a student the class.

Headline: Revived club focuses on aspects of humanities studies
Author: Megan Wright / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Revived last semester, the Humanities Club is not only aiming to have students spend more time on campus through cultural and educational activities but to make the learning process more enjoyable.

 "Humanities is indigenous to [the Biscayne Bay Campus] and since it's a commuter school, the club would be beneficial to students in that they can have a scholastic experience that feels more cultural and this way they can basically have fun and learn something," said Barbara Watts, an associate professor of art and art history who serves as the club's faculty advisor.

Like its logo, Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man," the club is intended to bring together ideas about art, architecture, human anatomy and symmetry.

According to Bruce Harvey, associate professor and director of humanities, one of the club's goals is to help bring a stronger sense of community to students with diverse intellectual, artistic and cultural interests.

"The club's activities-film nights, among others-promote and share the goodness of humanities throughout BBC," Harvey said.

The humanities program focuses on the insights, critiques and aesthetic visions of philosophers, poets, playwrights, fiction writers, artists, film makers and religious thinkers. This approach  will be employed by the Humanities Club through their events and lectures.

The club was first started in 1993 by Maria Demos, a professor and Classicist in the history/humanities department serving as the first faculty advisor.

Demos said the club was started because students wanted a way to express their ideas.

"Students who lived on campus wanted an outlet where they could share thoughts and experiences, so they decided to start the club. I was asked to be the advisor and I gladly accepted," Demos said. 

In 2003, Demos went on a sabbatical, and a year later, so did the club due to its inability to find a permanent faculty advisor.

After its long absence, the passion for 'great thought' was revived at the beginning of the Fall 2006 semester. Students interested in reviving the Humanities Club were introduced to each other by Harvey.

The club is not limited to humanities students. For a fee of $5 per semester, anyone who is interested can become a member. Tentatively, the Humanities Club will hold meetings on the third Thursday of every month at 7 p.m. in the Hospitality Management building, room 175.

"Right now we are just trying to find the right meeting time that's convenient for everyone," said Rossie Montegenero, a junior majoring in philosophy and current president and founder of the club.

Since its revival, there have been two meetings and the club's membership now stands at 10 members. Its officers, such as Montegenero, are hoping to attract new members through their activities.

"We want to increase membership and get members involved in campus life and arts, history and poetry through different activities," Montenegro said.

There are plans underway for the club to partner with an honor society to do community service; films followed by discussions are going to be an almost monthly affair, and trips to the Spanish Monastery  and Japanese Garden are also planned for this semester, though no dates have been set.

Headline: Faculty Spotlight: Rebecca Friedman, Associate Professor of History/Humanties
Subheadline: Creative professor takes time to write during break
Author: Jose Maya / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This semester, history professor Rebecca Friedman is getting away from teaching for a while as she continues to write her second book and awaits the arrival of her third child, due in February. She will return in the summer to teach, Introduction to Women's Studies.

Recently, she received a fellowship from the Natural Endowment of Humanities that will assist her with funds toward her work in progress, which is titled, Domestic Interiors and Modern Imagining: a Cultural History of the Russian Home. 

The date of the book's release is not yet known because of the complexities and research needed to write the book.

With a New Jersey upbringing and deep U.S. Northeastern roots, the University of Michigan alumna felt somewhat isolated when she first came to the Biscayne Bay Campus due to the majority of the history/humanities department being at University Park.

"I got assigned to BBC, and I felt alone. It was hard to get to know my colleagues and know the hallway conversation," Friedman, who now feels at home, said.

After teaching at FIU for five years, Friedman received the associate professor recognition from FIU during her sixth year.

"It was a tenure promotion given to me by my department and the College of Arts," Friedman said.

Friedman also won the FIU Foundation Excellence in Teaching Award in the Fall of 2005, where she was nominated by her department and voted by a faculty senate that decides, through student and peer evaluation, the professor's nomination.

Friedman's first book, Masculinity Autocracy and the Russian University, 1804-1863, was released in 2005.

Friedman, whose mother was an English professor, sees her mother and her former University of Michigan professors as mentors and teachers, a view that Friedman's former students share when they describe her. 

"She is a vibrant and interesting lecturer and inspires interest in her students," said senior Lisa Howe, a former student of Friedman majoring in history.

Students in Friedman's past modern European history classes did a mock session of 19th century British parliament. They then divided into groups and picked out a representative from each group to argue for or against women's right to vote in accordance to whatever thinker they were assigned.

Friedman, whose expertise is Russian history, also assigned students to perform a Joseph Stalin trial. 

Friedman believes the debates  are beneficial to the class. 

Loraine de la Fe, an FIU graduate, also enjoyed her former professor's teaching style and her level of involvement with her students.

"She's not of one those professors who lecture forever-she asks insightful and critical thinking questions and makes them get involved in the lecture," de la Fe said.

Lara Kriegel, history professor, had nothing but positive things to say about her co-worker. 

"She's a perfect colleague. She's smart, engaged, passionate and effective. She's an invaluable asset to the department and to the College of Arts and Sciences," Kriegel said.

As for her free time, Friedman says she enjoys reading contemporary novels and watching movies, as well as devoting time to her two young children.

Section: Life!
Headline: School of Rock: Budding Beatles class granted ticket to ride... eight days a week
Author: Reinier Hernandez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Anxiously awaiting the professor's arrival, the class slowly started to fill with students. The professor entered and wrote four names on the board: John, Paul, George and Ringo, collectively known as The Beatles, a band that changed not only the face of popular music, but the collective minds and attitudes of an entire generation and all those who followed.

Professor Armando Tranquilino set out to bring the history of The Beatles class to FIU and, in doing so, became the first teacher in all of South Florida to teach the course, which is taught at several other universities nationwide.

 "I wanted to not only teach the musical aspect of the band, but also why they've endured as such a cultural force into the 21st century as well," Tranquilino said.

The class, taught chronologically, touches upon not only The Beatles but their musical ancestors as well, tackling the blues and early R&B and segueing into the early rock 'n' roll era of Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley. 

From that point, however, the class is completely dedicated to dissecting and understanding each Beatle release: singles, albums, album covers as well as concert tours. The course covers the group's background and impact on political and social attitudes; the group changed the way people wore their hair, what clothes they wore and were pioneers in speaking out for anti-war movements and social equality. They also urged the public to open and expand their minds through meditation, Eastern philosophy and psychedelic drug use.

University Park campus' Student Government Council President Alfie Leon, who took the course this past Fall, particularly enjoyed the feedback and knowledge that Tranquilino provided about the band.

"It's a great class to open up a chapter of music to students who didn't live through it," Leon said. "The music is timeless and, in that way, the class itself is timeless."

Much of the learning in the class takes place in the form of classroom discussions but is supplemented by listening to Beatles songs, which is intended to showcase the group's musical evolution from deceptively simple love ballads to musically and lyrically complex pieces of art.

Students registered for the class also get to watch rare footage of The Beatles in concert and several of their films, which have been out of print for years. For one learning exercise last semester, Tranquilino brought a session drummer to perform for the class to demonstrate some of the originality and innovation the Beatles displayed in their drumming, while Tranquilino played piano and bass guitar.  The two musicians took song requests from the class and gave background information about each tune, ranging from the songs' difficulty to how the songs were still original and fresh after 40 years.

Senior Shaan Dholakia, another student who took the class in its experimental stage, was impressed by the professor's passion for the music.

"A class like this reminds people what music really is and shows that bands today are only emulating what The Beatles did before," Dholakia said.

Due to the popularity and success of last year's experimental course, the class has become a permanent addition to the roster starting Spring 2007 and has become an online course in order to eliminate problems that arose from classroom availability. 

Tranquilino stresses, however, that the class will not just have only assigned readings now that it has moved to an online format. According to Tranquilino, there will be "listening portions, video clips, as well as personal recordings from myself to highlight certain key elements to The Beatles' sound."

Although the class has only been around for a semester, it has received promotion on radio airwaves, including the weekly Beatles talk show "Beatle Brunch" on Majic 102.7 and its website brunchradio.com.

Anyone interested in registering for the class can look for MUH 2993 on PantherSoft. In the words of Tranquilino, if you're "ready to rock and learn about The Beatles, then sign up."
