Headline: Dolphin fans should not get their hopes up
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the exception of last year, for as long as I can remember, Miami Dolphins' fans always have the highest of expectations for their football team. 

"Super Bowl or bust" is the mentality year in and year out. Now, I know that's the mentality with all fans of all NFL team, but the Dolphins are a special case. 

Take this year for example; with the acquisition of Daunte Culpepper being the biggest move of the off-season, the Dolphins are now -all of a sudden - a Super Bowl contender. Sports Illustrated picked them to go to the Super Bowl and ESPN the Magazine has picked them to win the whole thing.

But how much better have the Dolphins really gotten? Unfortunately, not that much better at all.

With the loss of Ricky Williams, Ronnie Brown is now expected to carry the full load of the running game. Even when he was at Auburn University, Brown was never the feature running back of the offense - he spilt the carries with current Tampa Bay Buccaneer Carnell "Cadillac" Williams.

The secondary is as big of a question mark as it was last season and the rest of the defense is basically the same as last season too.

In other words, this is pretty much the exact same team as last season, replacing Gus Frerotte with Daunte Culpepper.

And after a highly disappointing loss against a Pittsburg Steelers team playing with their backup quarterback, Culpepper might not be the savior many fans expect him to be.

Not only did he complete less than 50 percent of his passes - completing 18-of-37 - in the NFL Kickoff game Sept. 7, he under-threw and over-threw receivers so many times I though Jay Fiedler was still playing for Miami.

Dolphin fans are quick to forget how terribly Culpepper performed last season before he injured his knee. Even though he threw for 1564 yards in seven games, he threw 12 interceptions to go along with only 6 touchdown passes - not to mention the five times he fumbled.

After Culpepper went down, the Minnesota Vikings took off and finished the season 9-7. Without Culpepper, the Vikings were 7-3 - with him 2-5. You figure it out.

The Steelers' game also showed us how flawed the Dolphins' secondary is. If Pittsburgh backup Charlie Batch can pass for 209 yards and throw three touchdown passes, can you imagine what Tom Brady or Peyton Manning can do to them?

Not to mention that if a 265 lbs. tight end can out-run the secondary for 87 yards and a touchdown,  what can a speedy receiver do to them?

I'm already depressed and it hasn't even happened yet.

The most depressing fact of all is that the Dolphins couldn't even gain momentum after recovering a Pittsburgh fumble on the goal line, which prevented the Steelers from taking a lead for that moment. They responded with a drive that ended in an interception - from Culpepper of all people.

It took Pittsburgh only one play to take the lead for good with that killer 87-yard touchdown pass. 

The fact that Culpepper threw another killer interception on what could have been the game-winning drive should show fans something.

Culpepper was put in two pressure situations - the first time to deal a death-blow to the Steelers and the second time to give the Dolphins the lead - and he failed in the almost the worst way possible. 

I'm afraid that the Dolphins acquired a Daunte Culpepper who is in the decline of his career - if his last eight games (dating back to last season) are any indication.

Considering the Dolphins haven't been to the playoffs since the 2001 season, winning a Super Bowl may too much to ask for. Making the playoffs will be hard enough.

I don't mean to sound like a cynic, but the Miami Dolphins will not win the Super Bowl this year, even if it is in their own backyard.

However, I really hope I'm wrong.

Headline: Young Marlins' playoff run making fans believe
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
By the time we're adults, we usually outgrow the belief that Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy are real.

But there's something in South Florida that should be peaking our interest, making us believe in those mystical stories and magical tales again. And I'll be the first person to admit it, I believe in magic, miracles and the Florida Marlins.

That's right, I said it. Those baby Marlins are going to make the playoffs.

And they're doing it the smart way - with pitching.

On Sept. 6 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, rookie pitcher Anibal Sanchez achieved the ultimate accomplishment in sports: a no hitter. He is the first pitcher to do so since Randy Johnson did it with the Arizona Diamondbacks May 18, 2004. His accomplishment personifies the whole Marlins season. 

Nobody would have expected him to throw a no-hitter and nobody would have expected the fish to be in the midst of a wild card chase. 

Throughout their entire history, the New York Mets have yet to have a pitcher throw a no hitter.

At the start of the season, a lot of experts predicted the Marlins to lose more games than the 1963 Mets who had 120 losses. It just goes to show you how much the "experts" know sometimes.

It's rare in sports that something like this happens. A rookie team with a payroll of $15 million contending for a wild card. Sure, $15 million sounds like a lot but consider this, five New York Yankees are making more money this year than the whole Marlins payroll and two are pretty close to that figure.

 

A Lost Story



"It's amazing, it's just too bad no one down here cares about the Marlins because they are missing out on a great baseball story," junior Jose Vidal said. 

An amazing story it is indeed. This entire season, the fish have been rewriting the record books. They are the first team since the 1952 to have three rookies record 10 wins within a season, a rookie second baseman became the first player in Major League Baseball history to make the All-Star team as a rule five draft choice and the most telling stat of them all: they are the first team to start the season 11-31 in May and reach .500 since the 1889 Louisville Colonels.

C'mon people, this is history in the making and only 12,561 people were on hand to witness something like this happen. Even ESPN broke coverage from their game of the night between the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox to telecast this nationally.

And you wonder why baseball is struggling in South Florida.

But let's not get away from what a special moment this was and what this season this could be. Imagine how much more special it can be if you believe.

The Marlins sure do.

Headline: Sophomore sensation
Subheadline: Trinidad & Tobago U-20 national shines for FIU
Author: Jannel Palenzuela / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After starting in 12 of 14 games last season as a freshman, sophomore Kia Rigsby has proven she can play.

The 5'6" defender from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad & Tobago was recently selected as one of 20 players to represent the country at the CONCACAF Women's National U-20 Final Qualifying Tournament Team. She is also one of only five United States based players selected. The tournament will take place Jan. 18-27 in Mexico.

"I've served in seven [national teams] but it's great because I get to go home and see my family and eat good food," Rigsby said. "It's a good bond."

Rigsby also served on the Women's National U-19 Team in 2004 where she helped Trinidad & Tobago (1-2-0) close out group play with a victory over the Dominican Republic (0-3-0). 

While playing at FIU, Rigsby recognizes that she has learned new mechanics that she puts to good use everyday both in conference play and tournament play.

"I've been taught to attack a lot more [at FIU]," Rigsby said. "So when I go home and they see me being more aggressive and attacking more often than I used to they are a bit shocked."

Assistant Coach Ifeoma Dieke added, "When most freshmen come in they are a little scared of attacking and being aggressive, but she has really stepped out. She is no longer a freshman."

Coming in this season, Rigsby has started in all 4 games as of Sept. 8. As a freshman, she earned a starting position in 12 of 14 games played, which came as a bit of a surprise to the defender who did not think she would start that many games in her first year.

"I did not expect to get much playing time at all," Rigsby said.

One thing that was expected and delivered was her strong work ethic that was not only noticed by her coaches and teammates, but in her performance on the field.

"She gives 110 percent each time," Dieke said. "She is very enthusiastic and has fun, but she means business."

As the season progresses, you can expect to see her play hard and with plenty of emotion.

Senior Midfielder Valerie Patrick added, "She brings excitement to the team."

Although Rigsby's game was not affected when she first arrived at FIU, she admits that there were a few things that took her some time to completely adjust to. One of the main things was the weather, which was not quite like it was back at home.

"The sun is on you while practicing from 11a.m. to 1p.m. and it is difficult to get used to," Rigsby said.

Even though the women's soccer team is off to a rough start this season, Rigsby find ways to keep herself and her teammates motivated. 

One of the ways she remains optimistic is by bringing the team laughter. She also reminds them that there will be another game, which gives the team one more chance to pick themselves up.

"We have fun and enjoy the game," Rigsby said. "They are like my American family."

"She brings a lot of laughter and hard work to the team," Patrick said.

Perhaps that enthusiastic attitude comes from a few influences Rigsby had while growing up. The closest being those in her family.

"My brother and I always messed around and played [soccer]," Rigsby said. "My dad also played for a couple of national teams which made him a big influence for me as well."

On a personal level, Rigsby hopes to leave a certain impact on the team before she graduates. 

"I hope to have left a sense of determination and strong effort before I leave," Rigsby said. "As well as have fun while training and playing the game."

Although it is only the beginning of her second season, Rigsby has set some goals that she hopes to attain before leaving FIU. 

The biggest, yet first step, is winning the conference.

"We've got a pretty good feeling this year, if we can get it together. Winning this year and the others would be the best, especially the conference," Rigsby said.

Headline: 9/11 ~ Five Years Later
Subheadline: CHRIS ON CHRIS: A POLITICAL DEBATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
Author: Christopher Cabra and 
&nbsp;
Christopher Cabral ~ On the Left:



The events of 9/11 horrified people of all races and religions. Sadly, some partisans have used this national tragedy as a political tool. 



Many have been eager to invoke its memory, running smear campaigns depicting the tragic events which imply that if Democrats are given more power, our security will be weakened.  



These claims are not just scandalous; they are wrong. In fact, Republicans cannot claim superiority on the issue of security.



Take for example, the way they've handled the Department of Homeland Security. In May, the DHS announced that it would cut security grants to New York City by 40 percent. Decisions like these are made using the National Asset Database, the department's list of possible terror targets. The more targets a state has, the more money it receives. 



Shockingly, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty did not make the list. According to the New York Times, in lieu of protecting these vital landmarks, the DHS has squandered money in securing obscure locations such as Old Mac Donald's Petting Zoo in Alabama and Indiana's Amish Popcorn Factory.



No popcorn, no matter how delicious, belongs on a list of national treasures to be protected. 



The Republican security strategy is wide open for criticism. They've used terrorism as justification to curtail civil liberties, torture suspects, and invade Iraq. 



Yet the Washington Post reported last year that only 14 people with clear links to Al-Qaeda have been convicted since 9/11. Is that enough to justify the Patriot Act, illegal wiretapping, and the use of torture? 



Meanwhile, the Democrats have tried to strengthen our security. Currently, less than six percent of containers entering our ports are inspected. Yet when Democrats proposed an increase in funding to screen cargo, their request was denied. In fact, many worthy proposals have been rejected, from increasing funding for firefighters to heightened efforts, to secure loose nuclear material.



The most damning piece of evidence against Republicans however, more than the rejection of these proposals, more than the meager 14 convictions, more than their wacky target list, is how they've spent our tax money. 



They spent $70 billion dollars on an extension of tax cuts for the wealthy this year. That's $29 billion more than the entire homeland security budget. 



The Republicans have failed to live up to their own rhetoric. They've failed to deliver on finding the WMDs and on providing adequate body armor for the troops. Given this, it's no surprise that the Alex station, the CIA department charged with capturing Osama bin Laden, was shut down earlier this year. 



Like any other issue, when it comes to security, actions speak louder than words.



Someday we may have a congress willing to challenge the status quo and fix some of these glaring security oversights. Someday we'll have leaders who live up to their promises. But for now, Republicans will continue calling Democrats weak and ignoring all of their ideas - some of which could very well protect us.





Christopher Necuze ~ On the Right:

Over the last five years since 9/11, the Bush administration has made homeland security its top priority. 

If you're going to roll your eyes, do it now. My Democrat buddies will show me fact after fact proving beyond a reasonable doubt - to them at least - that our country is actually less safe than it was before that day in September five years ago.

This is where I roll my eyes, because there is one fact that dismisses everything else as mere speculation. It is the fact that not only keeps me voting red but keeps me hopeful that we are actually making progress despite all the bad news: there have been no terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland since September 11, 2001.

Game over. The Bush administration must be doing something right because if they weren't, terrorists who live only to kill Americans woAuld have found a way to penetrate our defenses. It is most certainly not for a lack of trying that Osama bin Laden's henchmen have not succeeded in attacking us. Those up to date on their current events will recall certain arrests made in the U.K. just a few weeks ago which disrupted a plot by terrorists to use liquid explosives to destroy jetliners in mid air, killing all on board.

Not being able to accept the possibility that some of the countermeasures set in place by the Bush administration and its allies are actually working, liberals immediately disregarded the whole thing, claiming it was a ploy by the administration to inject fear into the American people. 

Sorry to all you conspiracy theorists out there, but until you can find me some proof, I'll give just as much credibility to that statement as I'll give to the one that says the federal government had a hand in 9/11. The thought that our government had something to do with the events of 9/11 is absurd and completely devoid of any physical evidence. 

I would like to pose a question to all of the liberals out there: if you were in power what would you do that is so radically different that it will solve all of our security problems?

If the Democratic National Committee has an answer to the national security question, I sure wish they would share it with me - because all I see coming from the Democrats is complaint after complaint, but no real solutions. What will be the Democrats' platform next election day? The same thing it was last election day: Bush is wrong, end of story. They'll elaborate on that until they are blue in the face, but that's essentially it.

I am not trying to paint President Bush as a savior who can do no wrong. This country still has a long way to go before it can say that it is sufficiently protected against terrorists. In fact, that day may never come. 

All I am trying to communicate is that until I am offered a better alternative I will vote for the party that has not let a terrorist claim a single American life on American soil since 9/11.

Headline: Pepsi may become University's new soda vendor
Author: Ben Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In 2001, the Coca-Cola signed an exclusive 10-year contract with FIU, which states that the only beverages that will be sold on campus will be Coca-Cola products. 

However, things may be about to change in favor of the Pepsi Corporation.

When Coca-Cola signed the contract with FIU, the contract had a five-year renewal clause, meaning after five years, FIU could look for someone else to provide beverages on campus if they are dissatisfied with the service. 

When Coca-Cola outbid Pepsi five years ago they added an exclusivity clause to the contract, meaning that only Coke can sell beverages on campus. 

The five years are up and FIU has been searching the market. 

 "Every year Coke hires one or two students to make sure we are fulfilling our part of the contract," said Felicia Townsend, Director of Business Services.

Adding the clause to the contract also meant that Coke would have to pay FIU an increased amount. 

Townsend is currently in the process of preparing to send out a notice that FIU is in the market for a new vendor. 

While no bids have been received, Townsend said that there would really only be two competitors: Coca-Cola and Pepsi. 

Townsend also said that the selection process would remain neutral.  

However, Wolfgang Acevedo, Student Government Association Student Services Chair, alluded that Pepsi is being leaned towards in an interview, meaning the selection process may not be as unbiased as intended. 

Among members of a committee made up of faculty, staff, Business Services and SGA memberswill cast a vote over the switch. 

Each group has a vote.

 However the vote is not the final word of the decision process, rather the decision by this committee is taken to the executive council for approval, a decision that is usually upheld, according to Townsend. 

Only if the executive council strongly believes going against the decision will they overturn it. 

"We are looking for what's best for students," said Townsend. This guiding principle is supposed to help the committee remained unbiased.

In the process of selecting the better bid from Coke or Pepsi, the council chaired by Townsend will look at several key aspects of a bid. One who can give the best prices for students.

Also, details such as maintenance and student scholarships could be the key point in the council's choice to switch. 

More importantly, would be the percentage return FIU would receive from every product sold. FIU currently receives a percentage of every Coke product sold on campus. A factor such as that could easily sway the council. 

"FIU was an unofficially Pepsi exclusive school before we switched to Coke," said Townsend. 

Townsend also indicated free product could also have some sway over her committee. "Coke currently gives us 100 cases of product a year to give out to students as we see fit," said Townsend. 

Any student organization can request the free soda for events at the Office of Business' website, http://obs.fiu.edu. 

"Students are limited to receiving 10 cases and if their event has any fee associated with it, it is not likely they will be approved to receive the free product," said Townsend.

Headline: University enrollment increases
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When freshman Asad Malik was thinking about his college career, he didn't think about Harvard, Yale or Columbia. Instead, Malik, like thousands of other students, decided upon FIU.

"I chose FIU because I like the city of Miami and my dad graduated from FIU, so there's a little bloodline there," said Malik, who is originally from Jacksonville.  

Malik is part of the more than 40,000 students attending FIU this semester, and the University is once again showing strong and rising enrollment numbers.

"The high enrollment rates affect the University in a positive way," said Larry Lunsford, Associate Vice President of Student Affairs. "It increases the University's visibility and the students that graduate become alumni and are supportive of the University."

Although official enrollment numbers for the Fall 2006 semester have not yet been compiled, the available information indicates another hike in undergraduate and graduate students. 

According to the Office of Planning and Institutional Effectiveness report, FIU accepted 31,199 undergraduate students and 5,732 graduate students; a total of 37,326 were enrolled at the beginning of the Fall semester.

Data for international students, unclassified students and University Park/Biscayne Bay Campus allocation is not available at this time.

"The growth can be attributed to better national and international reputation," Lunsford said. "The University becoming known nationally and internationally attracted people who had never previously heard of FIU.  When your programs are ranked nationally, people read about the program; [if] they want to major in that particular field, they start looking at the institution."   

As in 2005, approximately 57 percent of those students are female and 43 percent male.

Eighty-two percent attend UP, and about 20 percent attend BBC.

Throughout the University's history, FIU has consistently shown a strong growth in its numbers of enrolled students.

In Fall 2005, the official semester headcount for undergraduate students totaled 28,914; graduate students totaled 5,416 and unclassified students 3,094. 

The semester total was 37,424.

"Local people are becoming better aware of FIU through their high school guidance counselors, letting them know that you've got an excellent school right here in your backyard, and you don't have to leave home.  A vast majority of FIU students are local," Lunsford said.

As the number of students continues to rise, Lunsford said that "the school's grown and made more room for more students: building more buildings, attracting more faculty and a better quality faculty."

Among these new buildings are facilities to house old and existing programs at FIU, such as the Marine Biology building at BBC, two Life Sciences buildings, the new College of Law building at UP and a Graduate School of Business building, currently under construction.

"We continue to build more academic space as the number continues to grow," Lunsford said.

Due to class add/drops and continued enrollment throughout the semester, the enrollment numbers will change.

By the time Malik earns his bachelor's degree, FIU may have a medical school and thousands more students.

The school is tentatively scheduled to open in the fall of 2008.

 "I'll hopefully get into medical school.  I want to be a doctor - an orthopedist, or something like that," Malik said. 

For other first-year students, like Julie Timon, staying close to home and sparing financial hardship was what lured her to FIU. 

"I was going to go out-of-state, but I wasn't sure if I was ready yet," said Timon, who plans to study international relations.  "Also, I have Bright Futures in Florida, so I thought it was better for my parents to save money."

In terms of expectations for future growth, Lunsford said, "We'll continue to grow, because we have to meet our obligation to educate our students, especially those graduating from Florida high schools.  I think that's part of our community mission as well - to educate local students."

Headline: False fire alarms disrupt classes
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
As freshman Vignesh Doraiswamy sat in his ENC 1101 English Composition class, the last thing he expected was the loud ringing of the fire alarm. Within seconds, his class had to evacuate into the halls of the Graham Center in University Park.

'We all had to leave class and stand outside. Fifteen minutes into class, the alarm went off and we had to evacuate," Doraiswamy said.

Doraiswamy was affected by a fire alarm at least two more times later on in the semester.

Like Doraiswamy, many students attending classes in the GC have had their classes interrupted since the summer of 2005 because of a series of false fire alarms.

The alarm had been triggered because of the construction during the renovation and expansion of the food court and Atrium.According to executive director Ruth Hamilton, the false alarm went off in three waves over the summer. The first wave of alarms were during the breaking and rebuilding of the food court.

"During the remodeling of the food courts, it was unpredictable when the alarms would go off," Hamilton said. 

According to Carlos Aspillaga, senior project manager of facilities management, the cutting of the slabs in the concrete created a lot of dust that routinely triggered the alarm.

"We were cutting the slabs of the floor in many places including Pollo Tropical and Burger King," Aspillaga said. "The dust created from this caused the alarms to go off."    

The second wave of alarms was when the new equipment in the food court had to be connected to the building's gas system, according to Hamilton.

"Whenever the new ovens and machines had to be connected to the University's current gas system, the alarms went off," Hamilton said. "However, we tried to work after 7 p.m. and on weekends as much as we could to avoid disrupting classes."

According to Aspillaga, the third wave of fire alarms went off a week before the Fall semester because Fire Marshal Tom Morz was testing out all the fire systems of the food court.

"We were making final inspections on all the restaurants opening in the Fall," Aspillaga said. 'The marshal double checked everything personally and made sure all the equipment complied with the requirements."

 Betty Wright, senior secretary of Campus Life didn't mind the alarms but did admit being a little annoyed.

"The alarms didn't bother me because it's a necessary procedure," Wright said. "Yes, it's annoying, but it's still important. I'd rather be safe and get out than stay inside and ignore it."

Similarly, Doraiswamy didn't have a problem with the alarms because he got ten extra minutes of free time but added that he didn't like that no one knew what was going on.

'The professor had already begun his lecture when the alarm went off," Doraiswamy said. "No one knew where to go and what was happening when the alarms went off."

Hamilton assured that now that the Fall semester has started and the food court is complete, there wouldn't be any more alarms and interruptions of classes.

"There hasn't been a alarm in the past week and there isn't any reason to believe that there'll be another false alarm," Hamilton said. "If you hear an alarm, then that would be the real thing and not a drill."

Headline: Graham Center hosts 9/11 event
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
"Whether you were watching it on TV or had family involved, that day forever changed the lives of people around the world," said Vanessa Vazquez, coordinator of Administrative Services.  

To commemorate the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the Graham University Center is organizing a series of events today in memory of those who lost their lives on the day. Among the events planned are performances by a member of the FIU Marching Band, a presentation by the National Guard, a History Channel documentary and a candlelight ceremony.

"The event is meant to look back upon the events of 9/11 and those who died," said Student Union Committee Chairman Michael Jadoo. "It is also an event to honor those working in the FIU services."

The events will begin at 8:30 a.m., with the distribution of flags and the half-mast ceremony. The FIU Marching Band will perform the National Anthem at 9 p.m., which will be followed by a trumpet solo by FIU marching band member Cristian Escobar.

The afternoon's main events will start at 12:15 p.m., where Jadoo will deliver the opening remarks and officially open the ceremony. FIU ROTC Cadet Enrollment Officer Major Wally Gallart will then lead the FIU Army ROTC in a Color Guard presentation.

After readings and prayers by the multi-faith council, Vice President of Student Affairs  Rosa Jones will hand out recognitions to the Department of Public Safety, the Miami-Dade Fire and Rescue Department, the Department of Military Sciences and the volunteers from the Alternative Spring Break 9/11 service site.

"We wanted to make sure to recognize those who are currently serving in the army, the police, the firemen and the students who volunteered," Vazquez said.

The ceremony is expected to conclude with a candle ceremony and a moment of silence at 1 p.m. The candlelight ceremony will be a memento to remember how iconic that day was, according to Vasquez.

The participants of the ceremony will then be directed to GC 140 where they can watch "First Response," a History Channel 9/11 documentary, which will be followed by a panel discussion with Religious Studies professors Daniel Alvarez, Aisha Musa, and committe religious leaders.

Address: 18299 Biscayne Boulevard, Aventura, FL 33160


Because students are always on the run, they are always hungry; when sit-down meals seem too time-consuming and fast food too greasy, there seems to be few other choices. 

Gourmet markets that cater not only to "foodies" but also to those who want to escape the everyday are a perfect solution to fast food that won't completely empty your pockets or prepare you for a grease-induced heart attack.

The Fresh Market chain, a North Carolina original, dots most major towns in South Florida.  Their Aventura location on Biscayne Boulevard is a mere five minutes south of the Biscayne Bay Campus.  

Although The Fresh Market offers a large variety of gourmet foods, pristine fruits and vegetables and lively vivid flowers, its prepared foods, deli and bakery offer affordable choices that can be eaten in front of your computer while you pump out that five-page essay.

Its prepared foods range from unique wraps to fresh salads and even gourmet pizzas that can be popped in your oven and ready to eat in 10 minutes. A surprising wrap, now my favorite, is its Brie, apple and chicken wrap. The Brie cheese coupled with crispy slivers of green apple and grilled chicken work really well together. The Brie is creamy enough that mayo is left out but by no means missed. 

The Fresh Market also offers tons of sides to accompany your meal. Its lobster chowder and New England clam chowder, two soups that can easily be ruined if not prepared, are surprisingly good for non-restaurant fare. This can be attributed to its use of fresh chunks of lobster and Atlantic clams rather than seafood that is dumped out of a can.

You can also pick up other sides such as pasta salads, potato salads or even the basic but always comforting macaroni and cheese. Although its sides, minus its soups, are at best average, they are still worthy ways to round out a take-out meal.

Although The Fresh Market offers healthy choices, it still offers a bakery section that is filled with delectable and often sinful choices. I was on a quest to find the perfect piece of chocolate cake one evening when I arrived at The Fresh Market. Sure enough there it was, a perfectly ooey-gooey piece of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate sprinkles, a chocoholics dream. Pies, from the essential apple to the juicy wild berry, are perfect choices to be coupled with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Now that you have your meal, a side and even a luscious dessert, you can grab a drink and head to your place and chow down on a meal that can be purchased for around 10 bucks.

Headline: DBZ's gameplay lacking despite Manga influence
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Title: Super Dragon Ball Z
Developer: Atari / Bandai
Release Date: July 18, 2006


There are a lot of fighting games out there, but "Super Dragon Ball Z" takes gamers back to the glory days of arcade fighting. But don't let that statement fool you, there are plenty of new aged goodies thrown into the game. 

"Super Dragon Ball Z" makes use of cell shading graphics that were intentionally designed to mimic the original manga (Japanese comic) artwork of Akira Toriyama, the creator of "Dragon Ball." Toriyama was even consulted to design one of the playable characters in the game: Mecha Freeza. But other than that, the cell shading graphics are pretty standard - it's the concept behind them that makes the look of the game significant.  

Gameplay is where the game really finds its roots in classic arcade fighting games. The game was originally an arcade game in Japan before making its way to the states as a console game. Every attack requires players to execute sometimes complicated button combinations. So if you have ever played games like "Tekken," "Mortal Combat" or "Street Fighter," you will be familiar with the games control style.

However, for those inexperienced at fighting games, actually playing the game may be a little difficult at first. Newer fighting games like the popular "Super Smash Bros." for the Gamecube have very smooth, easy to control characters. "Super Dragon Ball Z" lacks this smooth handling, especially compared to other "Dragon Ball" fighting games available.  

Another drawback to the game is the method in which you increase your playable character's strength and how you unlock secret players to fight with. Basically you have to play through the game's story mode many times with a customized character.	     There isn't a lot of replay value either. There are some fighting games out there that you can play over and over again by yourself or with others. But "Super Dragon Ball Z" will probably not hold your interest long if played alone. Even when playing with others, considering how hard it is to control the game characters…let's just say most would opt to play one of the other fighting games. However, if this game had come out ten years ago, it would have been a smash hit. 

Nevertheless, it's not all bad: the music and sound effects from the game are catchy and realistic. Songs like "Cha-La Head-Cha-La" are taken right from the television series and remixed in the game. Most of the voice actors from the English version of the series reprise their roles in the game. So for the die hard fans of the "Dragon Ball" series, that's a definite plus. 

All around, "Super Dragon Ball Z" is a standard fighting game. The concepts behind the game do make it stand out compared to some others, but I don't recommend buying the game unless you find it in the super discount bin at Wal-Mart.

Subheadline: Warning: Smoking may cause column
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
I can't remember my first day of school, my high school prom or my PIN number, but I can easily remember the day I became addicted. I had just finished my first day as a hostess at a pricey restaurant, and I had never had so many affluent people look at me like I was trash. I guess they could smell the minimum wage. 

My trainer and I stepped out after our shift with our feet aching and headaches pounding. He looked at my miserable face, pulled a box out of his blazer and said, "Here, you look like you need one of these." 

That was the day I met the greatest love I've ever known. His name was Parliament. 

We've had some great times these past four years. We go clubbing, we take long walks and he consoles me when I've failed a test or had a hard day at work. I can always use him as an excuse to leave family gatherings or boring social events.

He even gets along with my diverse circles of friends like vodka and tonic or coffee and newspaper. 

But alas, our relationship must end because, like all of my other relationships, he will be the death of me.

I know I'm not the only one in a destructive relationship. Here's how to get out while you're still alive.



Knowing when enough 

is enough





I'm not saying all smokers are addicted. Everything, when done in moderation, can be controlled. However, there has to be a point where you can recognize things have gone from mildly amusing to pathetic. Like Paris Hilton. 

One way to recognize a problem is when your bank statements start looking like Marlboro invoices. Another is when you walk down the Graham Center and your smell can create an unintended 3-foot force field around you.

A sure fire way to know if you're addicted is when you find Angela's Ashes on your syllabus and wonder if she buys lights. I knew I was addicted when I drove by a pet crematorium with the windows down once and thought, "Wow, what is that brand? It's funky." 

Nevertheless, there's more to quitting than acknowledging your problem and fashioning yourself a nicotine patch, weight belt or corset. It's a mental game. You have to look the enemy in the eye and say, "Mom, I will not let you control my life anymore." Wait, that's not right…



Associate the good 

with the bad



James Dean is dead. You have to convince yourself that the days of smoking to look cool have gone with him. It's hard to correlate nicotine's tingly sensation as the grim reaper's scythe. Therefore, you have to associate smoking with lifestyles that are simply not you.

You have to say to yourself: 1) I am not a pretentious bohemian poet. 2) I am not an emo kid stealing his mother's cigarettes because she wouldn't let him go to the AFI concert.

What I like to visualize is me in 40 years living with 18 cats pressing an UltraVoice to my neck. I sound like Optimus Prime as I muster the words, "Here kitty, kitty" only to drop my device into an open can of Fancy Feast.

Kicking a cigarette habit is no easy task. It usually stems from an oral fixation difficult to replace. If anything, you can chew gum, suck your thumb, or bite your nails. I mean, I don't know what I'd do without my Cuban cigars. Good luck.

Headline: The Clast
Subheadline: What you need to know to get over the hurdle
Author: Nicole Acosta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For Patricia V. Montalvan, her final grade in Freshman Composition determined whether she would have to take the CLAST exam. 

The junior earned a B minus in ENC 1101 and a C in ENC 1102.

"They told me I wasn't exempt from it because of a minus sign," she said.

Because Montalvan did not fulfill her exemption requirements, she took the CLAST exam for the first time during the Summer C semester of 2006. 

Montalvan passed the essay and the language skills portion of the exam, but it was the reading comprehension portion that she did not pass.

"The main reason why I did not pass was because of the time. It was a lot of reading," Montalvan said.

Montalvan is just one of many students who still have to fulfill the CLAST, or the College Level Academic Skills Test. It is required by all students looking for an undergraduate degree in the State of Florida. It should be taken by all undergraduate students by the time they complete 55 to 60 semester hours, but not before completing 18 semester hours. 

Transfer students with more than 48 semester hours should take the CLAST during their first semester at FIU. Students with an accredited bachelor's or higher degree are not eligible to take the CLAST.

Students can be exempted from the exam if their SAT score is 500 or above in each section or their ACT score is 21 or above in English and Math and 22 or above in reading. If they have a 2.0 GPA average in their two English and two pure Math classes, the CLAST requirements are satisfied.

Maria Kulick, director of the University Testing Center, had several tips concerning the CLAST exam.

"The first thing a student should do is try to exempt the test," she said. "The second tip is to not wait or postpone the CLAST because many students delay the satisfying of the test and block their ability to register for upper division classes."

Kulick is right - students who do not take the CLAST before completing 60 semester hours may be prohibited from continuing their education by being removed without refund from upper division courses they are enrolled in or by being barred from registering at FIU until the CLAST requirements are met.	

To prepare for the CLAST, students have several resources at their disposal.

FIU has a link on its website to GATO, a site that links you to a CLAST exam practice test. There, students can take a practice test for the reading, writing and math portions. The essay portion, however, is not available to practice online. Once students complete each section, they will immediately receive an online report that will reveal their score and the specific questions that were missed. Students will also be able to click on a tutorial in the areas where they missed a question. 

Char Eberly, an English professor and a coordinator of the writing lab at the University Learning Center, says the lab helps students prepare for the CLAST by first giving them a diagnostic. Eberly advises students to "come early, come often."

CLAST preparation workshops are offered three different times a year during the beginning of each semester. Students may register for these workshops at the Testing Offices in University Park's Primera Casa 248 or Biscayne Bay's Academic I 160.

Miami-Dade College and Broward Community College offer day, evening and weekend courses for the CLAST exam.

Also, the FIU Bookstore and Libraries have books and study guides available for those students who need to take the CLAST.

Although there are a vast array of study guides and tools for the CLAST exam, some students, like Montalvan, do not study for the exam at all.

"I just didn't study," she confessed. "I was also taking classes at the same time. I didn't think it was going to be too complicated."

Montalvan has some advice for students in her position.

"Manage your time. It's going to be a lot of reading in a short period of time. Or, be aware of the grade that you need so you don't have to take it," she said. 

To make an appointment at the UP Learning Center, call (305)-348-2180. For BBC, call (305)-919-5927.

Headline: Students' feelings mixed on 9/11 movies' timeliness
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Five years after Sept. 11, 2001, most Americans still remember the events as if they were yesterday. The attacks in New York City and Washington D.C. affected the lives of millions of people, either directly or indirectly. Immigrating to the country became harder than ever; airport security wasn't the same; and more people of Islamic, Arab or South Asian descent were subjected to hate crimes. 

Hollywood hasn't been an exception. Since 2001, there have been more than 100 films or documentaries released that reference the 9/11 tragedy in some way. It could be a minor reference, like in Richard Curtis' romantic comedy "Love Actually" (2003) or it could be the crux of the plot, like in Michael Moore's highly controversial but critically acclaimed documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" (2004).

However, 2006 saw the release of two vastly different, highly publicized films that directly dealt with the terrorist attacks - "United 93" and "World Trade Center."   

The public reaction to these films has been mixed, to say the least. The first film, Paul Greengrass's "United 93," dramatized a popular theory of events on board the fourth hijacked flight and what may have happened in its final moments before crashing near Shanksville, Pa. The film opened the Tribeca Film Festival in late April to some of the year's best reviews but despite critical acclaim and buzz, the film failed to sell tickets, perhaps mirroring public sentiments.

Junior Anisha Perez, who lived across from Manhattan on 9/11, refused to watch the films because of the events' effect on her community. Perez, a native of New Jersey, didn't think enough time had passed to make a movie on the events.

"That day and the weeks and months that passed took a toll on everyone around me," Perez said. "Luckily, I wasn't affected personally, but I know a lot of people who did and I think that it's just too soon for these movies to come out. I really couldn't imagine seeing those movies. Just thinking about it makes me cry."

Senior Henry Wolfinger also thought it was too soon for Hollywood to release films about 9/11. "There are many things about September 11 that people don't know about and not everything that movies depict could be realistic,"  Wolfinger said.

"I'm pretty much against all [the 9/11 movies] and I don't think they should be made because I'm against worshipping the people who died on that day or making them heroes," Wolfinger said. "History has had time to go back and analyze Vietnam and say, hey, maybe Americans did messed up things out there. Same with Pearl Harbor. There's no heroism there. Americans got owned and that's the story they tell. But 9/11 is too recent for us to analyze and clearly say, hey, this is what really happened."

Senior Sam Enos, a TV Production major and a student in the Film Studies program who hasn't had the chance to watch the films as of yet, wasn't against the idea of making films about 9/11, but since he hadn't got the chance to watch the films, he wasn't sure if he could make any judgments.

"As long as the filmmakers are staying true to the story and as long as they are presenting the truth, I don't see a problem with making a film on the events," Enos said. "However, I really can't say unless I've seen a specific piece of work." 

To Barbara Weitz, dean of the Film Certificate program, the films are another way for Hollywood to cash in on the misfortune of others.

"Hollywood is cashing in, which of course, is no different from the Administration in the White House. Shameful and shameless," Weitz said.

The second 9/11 film, "World Trade Center," was directed by controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone, known for courting conspiracy theories. Initially, there were concerns that the film would be similar to "JFK," his 1991 film about the conspiracy behind the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. However, the film didn't have any strong political comments and was seen by most as a tribute to the police officers and firemen who lost their lives at the WTC. The film starred Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as New York Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jemeno who get trapped in the rubble of the first twin tower. 

Senior Frank Perez, a TV production major, recently watched "World Trade Center" and was supportive of the film.

"[The movie] was not a like a regular commercial film -- it was a tribute to what happened," Perez said. "You don't even see the planes hit the towers. There's no money shot and it's more about how it affected the American people. My own problem was that it was only about two officers and it doesn't mention others who died on that day."

Headline: Make Your Choice
Subheadline: HEALTHY LIVING A MATTER OF CONSCIOUS EFFORT
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Many college students are aware of the need to stay healthy - we know that Mom always said to eat your vegetables - but we don't care enough to do much about it. True health means keeping all aspects of ourselves - our bodies, minds and spirits - finely tuned. 

Often, the college lifestyle stands in the way between students and this goal. Many students overload schedules, relying  on caffeine to skip sleep before tests in order to cram in more studying and fall into smoking and excessive drinking on weekends. Because FIU is rooted in the body-conscious Miami, one may work out regularly, but may also follow trendy diets like Atkins or South Beach. 

What many don't realize is that health is not about being thin or buff, so these diets won't help - instead, it's all about balance. 

Senior Health Educator Casandra L. Roache and Health Educator Dahlia Mohammed at the University Park Wellness Center, offer a wealth of practical tips that students can put into practice.

 

1. Don't skip breakfast! 



"By that, I mean toast, or one of those nutrition bars, not just a Snickers," Roache explained. "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It helps shake off our sleepiness and instead give us the energy we need to focus during our busy day ahead."



2. Think before you choose 

your on-campus lunch



Instead of choosing fatty options such as Burger King, Roache and Mohammed recommend to explore smart options UP has to offer. Among their recommendations: Camille's Café, Einstein's whole-grain bagels, wraps from the Breezeway Café and yogurt from the Panther Stop. 

"Be careful of the type of sandwich you get, even at Subway," Roache advised. "You still have to watch what you eat." 



3. Drink water



Even if summer's over and the weather eventually starts cooling off, remaining hydrated is crucial. Take a water bottle with you to class even if you're not feeling thirsty, because flushing your body with water keeps toxins out. 



4. Exercise… just do it



Roache recommends a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise three or four times a week. 

"It adds years to your life," she said. 

By making the choice to consistently work out, one automatically reduces the risk of countless diseases like heart disease and high blood pressure. But beyond that, studies show that exercise helps keep the mind active and sharp, especially when an aerobic workout is combined with concentrated toning like yoga or pilates. 



5. Take time out to relax



Psychology Today says that prayer and meditation significantly reduce stress, making those that practice it closer to focused, holistic health. 

Other good habits are pausing every once in a while to connect with our breathing, getting at least eight hours of sleep and actively observing our surroundings.

Aside from these helpful tips, Roache and Mohammed detailed the many resources that students can tap into conveniently at the Wellness Center. Assessments are available by appointment to diagnose students' "wellness age," meaning the age to which their health corresponds. The staff offers nutritional and stress-management consultations, as well as free 10-minute massages every Wednesday from 1 to 3 p.m.; condoms, HIV testing and vitamins for women are always free. 

Like many students,  Adela Poudratchi said she was unaware of most of these services, and would now like to take advantage of them. 

"The nutritional analysis sounds helpful because I know I don't eat right… I remain thin but unhealthy." 

The center will also host an open house on Sept. 21, with free give-aways and screenings going on all day. October will be breast cancer month, with free testing all month and testimonials from students who have experienced breast lumps firsthand on Oct. 12.

Welcome Week event rescheduled after hurricane Ernesto

Got Questions? an event geared to demonstrate all the services the school has to offer,  was cancelled due to the threat south Florida faced from hurricane Ernesto a few weeks ago.

"I was very disappointed that hurricane Ernestico ruined the event," said SGA President, Camilo Silva. "We didn't think of an alternative date and that was our mistake, we learned from it."

Although the event has not been scheduled for another date, Silva is considering the first week of October as a prospective time.

Arrangements to have the same vendors from around the area participate in the upcoming event are under way.

According to Silva, Edgar Izaguirre, elections commissioner of SGA, is working to come in accordance with the vendors for a particular date.

Rock band Another Day in December and Rock House Blend, a commuter coffee house that offers free coffee and foods are also expected to attend the next Got Questions? event.

Because South Florida is in the midst of its hurricane season, Silva feels it's important to schedule events with alternative dates.

"We've already started scheduling events with alternative dates," said Silva. "The inaugural town hall meeting already has an alternative date in case a hurricane threat disrupts the initial one." 

Student Government leaders travel to Captiol Hill for con   ference

Student Government Association members Edgar Izaguirre and Gabriel Labrador are getting ready to head out to the nation's Capitol to attend the 2006 National Student Government Summit.

Scheduled for Sept. 14 through the 17, which centers on strenghtening student governments in colleges and universities across the country, will be held at the "Holiday Inn on the Hill."

The four-day summit will include several workshops, speeches from former student government leaders and training sessions for students and advisors. 

"We're going to be learning how to create events, promote events, hold fundraisers and things like that to create a stronger student government at BBC," said Izaguirre, elections commissioner of SGA.

Examples of workshops that will be covered are: "How Can the American Student Government Association Help You?" "Power: How to Get It and Use It" and "Taking Control: Setting Priorities & Getting Results."

Headline: Career Services prepares for part-time job fair

&nbsp;
Students should send their suits to the dry cleaner as they prepare for the upcoming Biscayne Bay Part-time Job, Volunteer and Internship Fair.

Over 60 employers will be at the Wolfe University Center, Sept. 13 from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. to assist students with their professional goals. 

The event will extend throughout the entire first floor from the Panther Square to the Campus Life office.

According to Donna Lee, interim associate director of Career Services at BBC, even freshmen would benefit from this fair because they would be able to speak with recruiters and even be considered for a future internship if they cannot work for one at this time.

Lee said that over the last two years more than 500 students have participated in the job fair.  

However, since yearly surveys are not always returned, it makes it difficult for career services to have an actual figure of employed students.

"The beauty of the career fair is that it can help all kind of students from all different majors and different skills,"  said Lee.

Students will be able to choose from a retail store work environment like Macys, to a more serious professional career with the FBI.

Out of the 60 employers some of the most sought after companies by students are: Guardian Ad Litem program; Norwegian Cruise Line; Spirit Airlines; Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce; Miami-Dade Aviation Department; City of Miami; Department of Environmental Resources Management and Telemundo Network.

"I'm really excited about the job fair and hope to get hired," said Noelvis Martinez, a law student with particular interest in the FBI internship. 

Career Services offers students a variety of services to prepare for the fair, such as workshops on resume writing and session on how a student should conduct onself in an interview.

Headline: Club raises funds for conference
Author: Katrina Harig / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Six students who are members of the Biscayne Bay Campus Science Club will not be attending classes at FIU for two days. 

Instead, they will be representing the university in San Fransisco, Ca., with other students from the U.S and Latin America attending the American Chemical Society's 232nd national meeting and exposition.

The ACS Meeting is a weeklong event that takes place in San Francisco twice a year during the fall and spring semesters. 

It offers an array of conferences in chemistry, workshops for clubs with undergraduate students, instrumental analysis, and even train's students in how to find jobs in the chemistry field.

The club members will be presenting two distinctive posters at the Moscone Center, which they designed for the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test Festival they held in February as well as a film of activities with everything they accomplished. 

"We organized an awesome FCAT festival at Coral Park elementary with high school students to provide kids with hands on experience to prepare them for the FCAT and we are being invited to present the video at the workshops for the clubs,"  said Mayra Exposito, BBC Science club advisor and senior lab teaching specialist at FIU. 

"We will also be presenting the Lion Diabetic Camp poster to show what we did for kids with diabetes."   

In addition to presenting their works, students will have the opportunity to meet potential employers and representatives from different graduate schools.

"Graduate schools, such as Harvard, Yale, Duke, San Francisco University, and other universities with programs of chemistry, bio chemistry, or medical schools send recruits to the meeting and offer opportunities for prestigious scholarships or internships for students,"  said Exposito.

The fall meeting, which began yesterday, will run through Sept. 14 and is being held at the Moscone Center and at the Hilton San Fransisco.

According to Exposito, the meeting is hard to get into and expensive so extra fund raising was necessary to meet the expenses. 

Members relied on fundraisers such as lab manual sales, food sales, donations, raffles and occasionally car washes to raise money.

Exposito aids the club by ordering pizza or preparing a home cooked meal as another form of fund raising in order to raise more money for their trip and cut costs.

Car washes were not possible this year. However, due to lack of facilities, the Student Organizations Councilprovided the club with a monetary contribution.

"Every year the SOC helps us with the tickets, registration, and transportations plans," said Science Club Vice President, Angela Castello, a senior Marine Science major.

"This time SOC provided us with $2,500 which paid for the club members' tickets and registration," said Exposito.

 The students, which include club President, Jessalyn Machado; Vice President, Angela Castello; Secretary, Jessica Murrillo; Treasurer, Nicole Salazar; member, Mariano Amigarelli; and member, Diane Vickson left for San Fransisco on Sept. 9.

BBC Club Advisor, Dr. Milagros Delgado and Exposito will be joining the students at the meeting as well.

Headline: Library exhibits Haitian project
Author: Samuel Hyppolite / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The new Caribbean Studies Certificate programs offered at Biscayne Bay Campus introduces students to the appreciation of African and Caribbean culture around the campus.

One of the program's presentations was the "Haiti in Miami" project presented by students of professor Veronique Helenon's Haitian History class that was taught summer B this past summer.

The main purpose of this course was to examine the history of Haiti from pre-Columbian times up to the present day.

Students had to pay close attention to Haitian culture on both the island and the Diaspora, a term that refers to the scattering of people from their original homeland.

The student's final project was exhibited in the BBC Library during the end of the summer B term and will remain during the beginning of the fall semester.

According to Steve Switzer, access services librarian for the department of bibliographic content, the presentation has been greatly appreciated by students and other people who visit the library.

"One of the class projects was a visual introduction to contemporary Haitian art," said Switzer.

"This element of the Library display attracted a substantial amount of attention since Haitian artists are becoming more recognized and collectible now," he said.

"Not only was the display subject to attention because of its visual arts, it served as a source of information to people who read information about Haitian journey in the world history," he said.

Students like Yvsuf Rathore found the presentation very useful to teach people about Haitian values.

"The presentation was pretty informative and clears up a lot of the misconceptions people might have about Haitian culture," said Rathore, sophomore and chemistry major.

The presentation also portrayed the social influence of American culture on Haitians who live in the U.S. especially in Miami.

According to Helenon, some of these harmless influences are due to psychological factors.

"Most of the people who assimilate into American culture portrayed in my student's presentation were often due to a personal identity search," said Helenon.

"The way people interpreted Haitian culture and their primary conception about Haitians are important aspects to take into consideration when analyzing why some Haitians who immigrate to Florida tend to value other cultures more than theirs."

Headline: WUC sponsors essay contest
Author: Jemelle Tucker / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the high cost of textbooks, and other collegiate expenses, some students may be looking for budgetary alternatives.

The Wolfe University Center, which holds the majority of student activities located at FIU's Biscayne Bay campus, is hosting an essay contest in conjunction with the kick-off of its 2006-2007 year theme "Expanding Walls and Horizons."

With money provided by WUC's funds, winners will receive a gift bag for first, second and third place, and $150, $75, $50 bookstore scholarships respectably.

Although the WUC contest uses various themes each year, this is the first year they will be using the essay format.

"Last year we held a photography contest, but we wanted to change things a bit and try something new," said Vivian Perez, assistant director of Marketing and Guest Relations at the WUC. 

The basic idea for the essay is to give a personal testimony or belief on how FIU, its diversity or a student's involvement in extra-curricular activities, has helped widen walls or horizons.

Despite the fact that the WUC is located on BBC, the competition is open to all FIU students regardless of campus selection, but not open to members of the community or faculty.

All essays will be reviewed and assessed by a panel of judges, which will include students and faculty members who will then contact the winners via telephone or e-mail. 

 According to Perez, students can expect surprises during the celebration, though she would not comment on the specifics.

Prizes will be awarded at the ceremony for the kick-off in Panther Square at 11:00 a.m. on Sept. 19.

All applications and essays must be turned in by Sept. 13 at 5:00 p.m. in order to be fully reviewed. 

All submissions must include the student's name and contact information. 

A one page essay is required for entrance in the contest and can be sent to Perez at her university email, perezv@fiu.edu by the deadline.

"I think a lot of students are too busy with classes or other things," said Natalie Sious, junior.

Michael Foley, freshman, thinks talent may also have something to do with a student's willingness to participate in the event..

"Others might not want to write the essay because they do not like to write," Foley said.

However, Foley thinks the awards should be perfect initiatives for anyone at BBC.

"The prizes are pretty good so I think I would enter," said Foley.
