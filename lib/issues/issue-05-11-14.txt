RE: Absolute truth is a standard for morality"		Ric Babcock

				To thine own Self, be True

Having read the article published in the November 14th beacon, I felt an overwhelming response to comment and bring to light the short sightedness of the analogy which the writer, (J. Sierra) failed to recognize.  She brings an example of stopping at a light and using references to determine if in fact you are moving at that stand still position. What if your stationary building is in fact movable and you do use it as your reference? That is the flaw in using one denomination's interpretation of literal text of said, so-called reference book, otherwise known as the Bible.

First of all, I'd like to remind readers of the selected stories which were included, (set aside the omitted books), which took place in the conference of Nicene in 325 AD, which formed the Bible of today. Why were the books or interpretations of Thomas and Mary omitted, when they heard from the teacher that," all things that are possible for me are also possible for you". Would that have allowed the intercessor of a priest to have little validity if the common man knew that he had a direct communication link to the Almighty?

And why does the homophobic fear of pronounced "new covenant" believers use a sentence from the "old covenant" which may have been written to a small fledging tribe roaming the desert and needing to increase their numbers or be extinguished, justify the condemnation of at least a tenth of the world's population? The Carpenter/Teacher never condemned homosexuals, or prostitutes, but rather taught forgiveness and acceptance of all neighbors, acceptance of all Brothers and Sisters.

I remember a thought of the mythologist Joseph Campbell addressing the war in Lebanon, "If the parties could overlook the name they give their God, there would be nothing to fight about" The literalist of sacred text, have been the instigator of many of the wars of the world and is that truly the purpose of "religion", for some, it seems to be, "God is on our Side"!
 
This brings me to another point, about the varied denominations of all the Abrahamic Religions. Going back to the selected stories and books included in the Bible, and I'd have to clarify which "Version" you are referring to; how and why can learned men and women inspect and study the same text and come up with such different results to what this "Absolute Truth" really says? The valid difference of righteous scholars dictates that Absolute Truth may not be so absolute after all. Let us remember that the original language of the ancient writers were Aramaic and Greek. Certainly we know in Miami how imprecise the translation of ideas can be from one language to another. The word "Sin" is actually an archery term meaning "missing the mark, not hitting the bull's eye". Or take the children's game of telephone where I whisper a story to you and you then whisper the story you heard to the next person and after ten people someone whispers your story back to you. Certainly you can see how the multiple translations and interpretations of this Sacred Text can be distorted and finally taken by literalist and deemed Absolute, not exactly what was originally meant when written.

Lastly, I'd like to bring forth the agreement of sages through out history when asked what is real.  Scholars and philosophers throughout time have always answered that what is real cannot and never changes. This earth, this world and our bodies will eventually crumble and return to the material and matter which is presently conglomerated to make appear separate and individual entities. Your possessions, you can't take it with you, however, I will conjure that what can be realized is the love that we leave behind and which teaches us tolerance and which makes our way a little easier while we are in the classroom on earth. 

Just like Hitler, who took actions which he interpreted to be for the good of him and his people which elected him into power, so the sacred text literalist of the world would also, if they could, take up arms to convert non-believers of their particular faith to think like them and so where is the peace, I only perceive conflict. In the end, this place of duality doesn't matter, matter doesn't matter. 

What matters is that which is real and I contend that what is real is the Spirit which animates the corpse which we call our bodies. What is real is the universal principle that Love conquers Fear, for fear's only attachment is to the body which will one day, no matter how hard you try to avoid it, will be laid down and returned to the pile of elements which it was produced from. Don't tell me that believers of other faiths have no credence to live and prosper and learn to love on this earth because your translated, interpreted sacred text says it, you believe it and that settles it. 

Come to your own conclusions of; where did you come from and where will you go, but more importantly, what is my purpose here, in this classroom called Earth? Answer those three questions and you are free to live contently knowing that you are learning your worldly lessons. Tolerance of all diversions be they skin, language, ethnicity, sexual preference or religion is the true mark of being comfortable for one's Self, and that you have answered your questions satisfactorily.

In the end, Perception makes one's truth and perceptions change, according on the world filters which you look through.

In the end, be true to yourself so that what we need to learn will be taught and simple find the divinity in the words of Shakespeare when he wrote, "To thine own Self be true."

Freshman - Psychology
(305)856-9496

  As the winds of Wilma vanished over the Atlantic horizon, some of us suddenly found ourselves alone, wide-eyed in disbelief, among a wrecked community.  Some suffered the sudden absence of our highly advanced comforts, some perhaps even our most cherished possessions.  Violently, that familiar life that operated by a flick of the switch, the push of a button or a deadline to meet, was washed away among the dirt and leaves, uprooted.  Surely, surrounded by this rude and unfamiliar pause,  we must have asked ourselves the genial question: What do I do now?

    In this rare moment, I found myself recalling memories of Hurricane Andrew's aftermath and the silence of those evenings, the air of tranquility among those days of work and recovery.  After Wilma, again I found this comfort in a hurricane's wake.  I began a daily routine, starting the day collecting water and ice, reading books in the glowing afternoon, enjoying intermitten meals, feeling the cool wind and the birdsong, all in anticipation of eating the last perishable items for dinner.  But, this candle-lit paradise soon faded when the power began to creep into my life again.  I celebrated by struggling with the TV antenna.

    I can still remember those feelings I had adjusting to my primitive life, while sitting here surrounded by my electrical I-don't-know-what-I'd-do-without-them's, and I think about what I did without them.  And within these deep thoughts, I begin to visualize myself ascending away from the familiar world and, then, standing on a cliff overlooking the concerns of our highly advanced society.  I become baffled by my observations and ask myself why we blindly accept it all.  I try to convince myself that a corporate, military, oil-based, morally-obsessed society is not a life's requirement, but rather a temporary comfort.  And, we don't need a natural disaster to awaken ourselves to this reality.  All you need to do, when you're on your own existential summit, is ask yourself that genial question, honestly: What do I do now?

Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Lace up your Nikes, because on Nov. 19 you have a chance to compete against varsity student-athletes from four FIU sports teams in A Day at the Park.

FIU's women's tennis, golf, soccer and softball programs, in partnership with the Department of International Relations, are hosting a fundraiser in which student-athletes will play against the public. 

"The team members will be on their fields," said Jan Solomon, development associate for the INR department, "so bring your racket, bring your baseball glove and be ready to play soccer, because you can go on the field and play with them."

Food, beverages and T-shirts will be provided to participants. 

There will also be a silent auction and drawings for Nike apparel, a swim with the dolphins at the Miami Seaquarium and even an all-expense paid trip to see FIU's football team play the University of Alabama in 2006. Registration for A Day at the Park begins Nov.19 at 12:30 p.m. at Parking Lot 11, across from the Pharmed Arena. The event will run from 2-5 p.m. and lead into the FIU football game against Western Kentucky at 6 p.m.

Athletes of all levels are encouraged to participate as instruction will be provided by the teams. 

"It will be a lot of fun for people of all ages and I know the students will enjoy it a lot," Solomon said.

Tickets for the A Day at the Park fundraiser cost $10 for students and $25 for adults. They are available for purchase  all week at the FIU ticket office in Pharmed Arena, Nov. 16 and Nov. 18 at a table in the Graham Center and on the day of the event at Lot 11.

All proceeds benefit the enhancement of FIU's women's athletics and the INR department.

"We thought it was a great idea to combine because a lot of our teams have international players," Solomon said. "Why not get together and have a fun event on campus and raise money together."

For more information, call Jan Solomon at (305) 348-7551.

Headline: Two football players given weekly conference honors
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It has been a series of firsts for FIU football following their dramatic defeat of Louisiana-Monroe Nov. 5.

Following FIU's first ever Division I-A and Sun Belt Conference win, two FIU standouts joined the list of firsts. 

Junior defensive playmaker, linebacker Keynovis Bouie, who leads the Golden Panthers with 87 tackles this season, was voted the Sun Belt defensive player of the week following his 19 tackle (13 solo) performance on the weekend which included a blocked extra-point. 

Senior wide out Julius Eppinger joined Bouie as he too was honored and named the conference's special team's player of the week following his two return, 62-yard performance, which included a 41-yard return on the last, and most important FIU drive of the night. Later on that drive, Eppinger caught one of five passes on the day, an 11-yard touchdown from quarterback Josh Padrick.

The Golden Panthers return to action for their Homecoming game Nov. 19 against Western Kentucky. That game marks the first of a three-game home stand that will conclude the team's regular season schedule.

FIU's original homecoming game against Middle Tennessee, first scheduled for Oct. 29 and later postponed due to Hurricane Wilma, has been rescheduled for Dec. 3 at 7 p.m. at FIU Stadium.

Headline: Men's soccer ends season with tournament loss

&nbsp;
The FIU men's soccer team fell 2-0 to Marshall Nov. 9 in a Conference USA quarterfinal match, ending a season that started strongly but fizzled down the stretch. 

The Golden Panthers had routed Marshall at home Oct. 2, but entered Westcott Field in Dallas, Texas well aware that the Thundering Herd posed a threat.

"We beat 'em 7-0 the first time so they're probably gonna come back to hurt us," said senior Pierre HóSang Nov. 6, days before the game.

Senior Lucas Scudeler added, "The past doesn't matter in soccer so we're just going to play it as a regular game and forget about what happened in the regular season."

Forget they did. 

The Golden Panthers forgot to score, as nearly all facets of the first game changed in the rematch. 

Marshall got off to a quick start, taking the first six shots of the evening and outshooting FIU 11-4 overall in the first half. Back in Miami  Oct. 2, it was the Golden Panthers who jumped on Marshall early, outshooting the Thundering Herd 11-4 before halftime.

Despite the disparity, FIU only trailed Marshall 1-0 at intermission, thanks to three saves by goalkeeper Shawn Crowe. Marshall forward Osric Flores headed in the lone goal at 38:19 off a centering pass from midfielder Michael MacDonald.

With their season on the line, the Golden Panthers showed signs of life in the second half. 

Freshman Judah Hernandez led FIU with four shots on the night, nearly tying the score from the top of the box in the 48th minute. Senior Jared Rose added a shot on goal at 70:12 but Marshall successfully defended it. 

Less than a minute later, Marshall midfielder Nicholas Ademolu stripped FIU-leading scorer Carron Williams of the ball and dribbled past defenders up the right side of the field. Ademolu stopped from 23 yards out and blasted a shot over Crowe's head to seal the victory.

"It's disappointing," said FIU head coach Karl Kremser. "Marshall just played harder, worked harder and beat us to every ball. They just wanted it more than we did ... we just didn't play well."

With the win, Marshall improved to 8-8-2, a stunning turnaround for a team that began the season 2-7-1.

On the other hand, the Golden Panthers finished 2005 at 8-7-2 after starting 4-1-0, earning a No. 25 national ranking Sept. 19.  

FIU will miss out on the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001.

Subheadline: Riots in France exemplify underlying racial tension
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Many movie fans may be aware of the 1980s cult classic, Paris is Burning, a documentary tracking the underground drag scene in New York City during the peak of the AIDS crisis.

That title, however, could easily be used to chronicle the violent protests that have been taking place in many French cities for over two weeks following the accidental deaths of two Muslim teenagers Oct. 27.

What began as a mass outpouring of grief and rage by poor citizens of African and Arabic descent quickly escalated into an uncontrollable frenzy: Over 300 cars set on fire, the looting of stores nationwide, some reported deaths and a state of chaos supposedly not seen in France since the student-worker riots of 1968. After two weeks of the continual upheaval, the world could only look on in shock at what indeed appeared to be Paris burning.

The most astonishing part of this affair, though, is how many young people have been involved in the destruction. According to an Associated Press report, of the 272 offenders convicted in expedited trials, 81 have been minors. Reporters have taken images of young children flinging rocks at storefronts or dancing around fiery wrecks, leaving spectators to wonder how it is that so many children have easily become a part of the raging anarchy.

Though an easy answer would be to say that these are the children of the repressed immigrant workers who have complained of their second-class status in France for so long, this explanation just seems too politically correct. Some percentage of the rioters may indeed be protesting their social condition, but after more than 20 days of violence, it just seems that the attacks have lost their initial cause, looking more like random acts of violence by bored teenagers than a unified solidarity movement.

Already, imitators have sprung up in Germany, Greece and Belgium, youths using cell phone text messages and e-mails to coordinate their attacks. Now, are these rioters rebelling to show their approval of the French under class or are they taking advantage of the situation to have some selfish fun?

The riots have indeed proven to bring a focus on the plight of the immigrant poor in France, but the violence is no longer serving the original purpose. These riots cannot be condoned, especially when children are involved. However, there is nothing citizens of other nations can do at the moment, let the French government handle the situation as best they can.

We cannot know for how long Paris will continue to burn, but we must rest assured that, like all conflicts, the flames will soon begin to die down.

Headline: Alcohol not necessary for an enjoyable time
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The state of "Intoxication" has never been a place I've wanted to visit.  But, I've always wondered what makes others travel from their state of mind all the way to the other side of reality.

It's a region that I've heard some say to be very loud and bright.  Others say it's dull and sedated. Some say it's a naked and totally comfortable place where all of your insecurities suddenly slip away from you like a distant memory and you're thrown into a whole new "you." A "you" that does everything your current "you" would never.  

If you're quiet, you're loud; if you're shy, you're outspoken; if you can't dance, you're Fred Astaire.  Inebriation has become the fairy godmother of many college students.  

Yet, if you're the only one under the influence you're just another form of amusement for those who are sober enough to enjoy it.  Now that to me is the epitome of the expression "laughing at you and not with you."      

Our generation convinces itself of its need for alcohol to enjoy life. Are we under so much stress that it's the only way to relax? The concept is foreign to me.  I am not perfect, far from it actually.  

I am more near the mountainous lands of crazy rather then the serene lakes of perfect.  But to be in touch with reality is important.  I refuse to believe that it's necessary to become intoxicated to enjoy myself at a party or even a regular old get-together.  

Ultimately, it comes down to losing control.  That's the best way to arrive to that state.  We push ourselves to our edge and then throw ourselves off.  Nothing remembered, no idea where we are or who we are with: A moment of recklessness that has cost hundred's and thousands of young adults their lives each month.  

And yet, it's a college past time.  Movies encourage it and some campus activities would never succeed without it.  You always hear people say, 

"I dance better when I'm drunk" or "I'm so much more attractive when I'm drunk" or even better, "Everyone else is so much more attractive when I'm drunk."  However, they aren't so attractive the next morning.    

I love dancing.  I love going to clubs with friends and sometimes a drink or two is fun, but after a while the whole experience becomes cliché. And the truth of the matter, it is just not safe to drink even a little bit in some clubs no matter how big your group is.  More often then not, the designated driver has had a drink or two and nobody really minds.  

There is a huge gap between those who drink every so often in moderation when they go to a club and hang out with friends and those who directly associate drinking with having fun.  

We as FIU students are becoming extremely involved in caring about our community and reaching out to those that need our help.  We have new clubs popping up at every club fair and students from countries all over the world coloring our campus with a variety of personalities and people.  Are we going to throw it all away for one night of stupidity and daze?  If we allow it we're just becoming another number on the charts.

Headline: Absolute truth is a standard for morality
Author: Julie Sierra / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Is there such a thing as absolute truth? Is my truth your truth? Can anyone really be sure that some things are morally right or wrong? 

Many would say that the answer is no. Studies show that a lot of people in today's society believe moral truth is relative. Author George Barna says, in his book "Virtual America," that "Seventy-two percent of Americans agree, there is no such thing as absolute truth; two people could define truth in totally conflicting ways, but both could still be correct." This is especially common among university students. 

Let's say for a moment that moral truth indeed is relative and that moral standards vary according to individuals or cultures. What would happen if everyone in society applied moral relativism? What if the murder of an innocent child, or even millions of Jews during the Holocaust could not be condemned? How can anyone claim that justice and tolerance are virtues to be upheld if truth is decided by the individual? If we remove the absolute standard by which to govern our actions, then morality is simply up for grabs. 

During World War II, C.S. Lewis had this to say about the effects of relativism: 

"Everyone is indignant when he hears the Germans define justice as that which is to the interest of the Third Reich. It is not always remembered that this indignation is perfectly groundless if we ourselves regard morality as a subjective sentiment to be altered at will. Unless there is some objective standard of good, over-arching Germans, Japanese and ourselves alike, whether any of us obey it or not, then of course the Germans are as competent to create their own ideology as we are to create ours ... Unless the measuring rod is independent of the things measured, we can do no measuring." 

"Who or what is that measuring rod?" If there is no God, then we have no basis whatsoever to believe in any absolute truth. However, if there is such a thing as a personal God - one who takes interest in us, not just some distant deity - then we are responsible to learn what he says about the matter and furthermore, we are accountable to uphold his moral standards. 

Put yourself in this situation: You're driving your car, you come to a stop light, you apply the brakes, your mind is wandering and all of a sudden, you see another vehicle moving. You're not sure whether it's that vehicle or yours that's moving; what do you do? You automatically go for the brakes in order to make sure you're not moving. If you're still not sure, what do you do? You look around for something stationary, a lamppost or a building to make sure you measure yourself by the immovable object. 

What would happen if the building started moving too? Everything would be in chaos. The absolute gives you stability; it gives you a position by which to measure yourself. Truth, in fact, is a friend to the soul.

Why then, do so many university students shun the idea of an absolute moral standard by which to live? 

Allan Bloom gives one reason in "The Closing of the American Mind": "The danger university students have been taught to fear from absolutism is not error but intolerance. Relativism is necessary to openness ... the great insight of our times. The true believer is the real danger. The study of history and culture teaches that the entire world was mad in the past; men always thought they were right and that led to wars, persecution, slavery, xenophobia, racism and chauvinism. The point is not to correct the mistakes and really be right; rather, it is not to think you are ever right at all." 

Truth cannot be sacrificed at the altar of a pretended tolerance.

Headline: iPod
Subheadline: It has revolutionized the way we listen to music
Author:  Adrian Diaz / Opinion Page Designer
&nbsp;
The statement I'm about to make might seem hyperbolic but here goes: The iPod is the greatest invention of the 20th century. The iPod has taken what attracted us to the Walkman (portability) and added the ability to have much more capacity for music than we could ever hope to carry (no matter how large the CD case); as well as a screen where we can play video games, look at album art as we listen to music, make playlists on the spot and even rate our favorite music. (I gave Tom Waits's "Kommienezuspadt" five stars and one star to Radiohead's "Karma Police," if you were wondering). 

While Sony has updated its walkman to try and compete, the iPod has become the undisputed king of mobile music - a development that I'm sure disappointed many people at Sony. 

With the iPod, Apple has created arguably its most successful product, not only because of the features of the device itself, but also because Apple facilitates the consumer's ability to get content easily, which means that your little iPod's hard drive will never lack stuff to entertain you. 

I say "stuff" because with the introduction of the new video iPod you can now also download videos and put them into your iPod. 

This means that the iPod has finally made it possible to watch videos of your favorite shows in remarkably good quality while a professor rones on about literature this and economy that. 

"I'm dying to get one," says Freshman Christina Walden, "The video is great."

The addition of video has huge implications for Apple. Think of the difference between a hit TV show and a hit music album. The audience for the former is in the millions but in the thousands for the latter. This is why new Apple commercials so prominently show the new little marvels playing "Lost" or "Desperate Housewives."

The common criticism I hear about the iPod, or rather about people who have iPods, is that it stifles interaction between people. I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of striking up conversation with perfect strangers, and when I do, they're not very interesting and usually weather related (Is it cold enough for you?). 

In fact, I've found that it actually promotes conversation. I often find myself peeking at other people's screens to find out what they're playing and see if I can make some sort of insightful comment about what they're listening to. Granted, usually these are good-looking women, but it's still conversation. The iPod connects us at a very sincere level: The very shallow belief that our tastes define who we are.  

The main reason for the entire family of iPod's success is its simplicity. The iPod just works better and is easier to use than any other comparable product out there. 

These tiny jukeboxes have really become omnipresent. Walk around FIU and notice how many people have the discreet little white earphone wires going from their pocket to their ears. The minis and the new nanos are a fixture at every gym. I know I'm almost always plugged into my iPod walking between classes or when I'm at work. 

The popularity of the iPod is not solely an American phenomenon. I took a trip to France last summer and they seemed as transfixed by these little marvels of technology as we are. The iPods over there blast out years-old American rap music into the contented ears of many a Frenchman. Look into many French cars and, they'll be there too. 

My trip made me realize that maybe Americans and the French aren't that different. If you consider the iPod's conversation-sparking ability, I think that maybe President Bush and Preisdent Chirac could just get together and compare playlists they would both recognize that, thanks to their shared affinity for Merle Haggard, they're not so different and the problems between our two countries would finally end. The iPod - wonderful product and wonderful diplomat.

Headline: Board to review final med school proposal
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
After a decade's worth of meetings and planning, FIU will finally undergo the last step in its quest to get an allopathic medical school approved by the Florida Board of Governors at a presentation in Jacksonville, Nov. 17.

"We've been working on this new presentation for a long time," said University President Modesto A. Maidique. "We want to be prepared for anything. It will be an important day for the university."

The meeting, which will take place at the University of North Florida, will include a half-hour PowerPoint slide show presented by Maidique outlining the reasons why the BOG should approve a medical school program for FIU.

"There will be no new documents presented at this meeting. All the proposals have already been submitted - this will mostly be a summary of all the information already given to the board," said Carlos Martini, director of the medical school initiative.

The first proposal was submitted to the BOG July 8, 2004. The board reviewed this document and, after suggesting changes and methods of improvement, petitioned FIU administrators to turn in a revised version on Nov. 18 of that same year.

However, due to the length of the meetings on that date, FIU was not able to present the new proposal.

The meeting was rescheduled for January 2005 when the university finally submitted the reworked document.

"I'm very excited for this Jacksonville meeting," said Ronald Berkman, the newly appointed interim provost. "We've been working with the medical team on this presentation, which has so far gone very well. It will be a culmination of a lot of time and effort that we've put into the initiative, so it's a moment I'm really anticipating."

Besides FIU, the University of Central Florida (which has also spent some time trying to get its own medical program approved) will make a presentation at the meeting as well.

"The UCF proposal is consistent with ours. The numbers, data, information and research match closely because we're trying to let the BOG know that there's a need for more than one new medical school in Florida," Maidique said in response to charges that both universities may be competing for an approval.

Though there are currently three other accredited allopathic medical programs in the state, FIU would join the University of Miami in having one of the only programs in South Florida.

"We originally thought there would be opposition from universities with established schools, like UM," Martini said. "But so far, we've been having consistent cooperation from them, even discussing shared classes and initiatives with their program."

Administrators still say that, before making any plans, they will have to focus on the last steps of the proposal approval within the upcoming months.

"It's possible that the board could cast its vote on that date, but it's not likely," Maidique said.

The final vote will probably take place early next year.

If the initiative does get approved, administrators will then come up with a budget to present to the State Legislature to cover the new school's expenses.

"There is still some work to be done, but we're confident that our reasons and purposes for this medical school will gain support," Berkman said. "For now, everything depends on how well we do at this upcoming meeting."

Headline: Students speak out on bus ride benefits
Author: Arlena Amaro / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Before getting to class at the Biscayne Bay Campus, Anay Villar runs to catch the FIU shuttle at 6:45 a.m. Once on the bus, she catches up on class assignments, or takes a revitalizing nap.

Villar, a senior majoring in public relations, has been taking this 45-minute bus ride for the past six semesters and calls the experience a "very special one."

"Now that I am about to graduate, when I remember the bus rides, it's one of the good memories I'll take with me from FIU. I've met some of the best friends I've made in college on this bus," she said.

Villar's response coincided with that of other students, who agreed that the bus rides offered them an opportunity to talk and get to know new people majoring in fields different from their own.

"Think about it, you are stuck on a bus for 45 minutes, what else could you do? I mean, you could read and do some homework, but it's more fun to talk to the person next to you," said senior Leslie Hernandez, majoring in public relations. 

Another student, Michelle Escobar, a sophomore majoring in journalism, complained that the drivers would leave before the scheduled time.

"Last week, the bus that leaves five minutes after the first bus, left at the same time as the first one. And when I looked to see if it had left because it was already full, it wasn't. The buses are not supposed to leave if they are not full," she said. 

Other students, like Raiza Say, appreciate the bus ride because it eliminates having to deal with traffic and saves money on gas and tolls. 

"Instead of being stuck in traffic for an hour, I rather sit on the bus. I mean, you spend eight dollars in tolls if you take the Florida Turnpike back and forth [from] the BBC campus," Say, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism, said.

Reynaldo de Armas, one of the bus drivers of 7871, said he has been driving the FIU shuttle for the past year and believes that his job entails a lot of responsibilities. He said he likes driving and becoming friends with the students.

"We get some complaints, on average once every week, that the buses leave early or are late," said Lazaro Rodriguez, coordinator of the Department of Parking & Transportation. "Other than that, drivers are very polite and friendly, especially about Reynaldo. We've gotten good comments about that driver."

Henry Rodgs, another bus driver, said he used to drive for Galaxy Tour Bus in 1989. 

"Galaxy Tour Bus was the first bus company to provide transportation between the two campuses," Rodgs said.

Ever since then, the university has hired other bus companies, but in 2003, FIU signed a contract with 7871 INC. Bus Lines that expires in Oct. 2008.

Regular passengers have a variety of reasons for riding the bus, however, most agreed that it was a good place to catch up with old friends, meet new ones and most importantly, save gas money.

"The bus rides are special, you actually have time to talk to the person sitting next to you, read, or do anything you want to do. Even if it's just sitting quietly looking out the window and meditating, which I also love to do," Villar said.

Headline: Students take part in cleanup
Author: Chester Robards / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Armed with garbage bags and trash cans, a group of Biscayne Bay Campus students gathered to collect trash along the bay. 

The cleanup took place the morning of Nov. 5 and was coordinated by environmental studies majors, Shalom Mayberg and Amy Mehu. 

Together, they gathered a team of eco-conscious students eager to clean the grass and shoreline behind BBC. 

Every year, the department of Environmental Resource Management, an environmental agency for the city of North Miami, comes out to do a coastal cleanup on campus and in the surrounding areas. But now, students will be gathering to do the work themselves.

Immediately after a short welcome by Mayberg, the volunteers were handed their garbage bags. 

The trash collectors began behind the Hospitality Management building and moved south along the bike path.     

 Some students came to earn community hours, while others came to beautify their campus. 

"If we can keep our beach and any of our waterfront property nice, then it's more of an attraction to the ones who live here and also for the people who come to visit," said journalism major Mikaela Louve.

Although the majority of the students present were from BBC, students and faculty from both campuses were invited to join in the cleanup effort.

"I was expecting 30 people and we got 25," Mayberg said, "I did not get any faculty unfortunately."

Hurricane Wilma provided the students with lots of trash, which they managed to collect in 25 55-gallon bags, provided by the university. 

"It was a great time to clean up; perfect after the hurricane," Mayberg said.

When the trash collection was complete, the group received food and drinks donated by business services. 

"Every other place on campus looks really good to the plain eye. It's clean and you don't have trash around. That area needs to match the rest of the school's environment where it's clean and looks pretty," Mehu said, "The cleanup went great; I'm happy."

Mayberg is hopeful the cleanup will take place again in the Spring semester.

"I would love to have this cleanup once a semester; for now that would be worthwhile," he said.

Vice Provost Raul Moncarz appreciates the students eagerness to keep the campus clean.

"Participation and involvement are the signs of a great university and we are reaching that level and we thank the students for their tremendous achievement," Moncarz said.

Headline: Haynes excels through leadership
Author: Begone Cazalis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
At the Biscayne Bay Campus  someone has to set the goals,  visions and directions. 

Someone with strong  leadership skills that encourages departments  to work together.  

That someone is Brian Haynes. 

Haynes is the vice president of Student Affairs at BBC and has been working at FIU for over five years. 

"Other than report in the morning and the time I leave, there is nothing else that could be typical about my day at work," Haynes said. 

There are a wide range of duties that Haynes has to address.

"The Student Affairs areas on this campus are part of my portfolio, and I am charged with providing leadership for those areas," Haynes said. "Leadership is defined as budgeting, strategic planning, hiring personnel, setting a vision and all in collaboration with our vice president of Students Affairs at the University Park [campus]." 

Haynes, an Ohio native, is in charge of coming up with new goals for the campus. One of his accomplishments includes increasing programs - from 35 documented in Spring 2001 to over 100 in Spring 2005. 

"The big issue now is expanding Wolfe University Center for students, with a new fitness center and new dining facilities. Hopefully, in the next 12 to 14 months, we'll see that project completed and then we'll look for a new challenge," Haynes said. 

Lemar Linton, vice president of the Student Government Association at BBC, said Haynes has been a mentor to him. 

They have worked together on many projects such as the expansion of student offices and the improvement in customer service in Student Affairs departments. 

"Dr. Haynes works hard to get things accomplished," Linton said. "Unfortunately, we all must abide by the university's general system which in itself is slow. Projects are in progress and results are in sight." 

Producing a vision that will satisfy students is no easy task. But having an office far away from the student body has not stopped Haynes.

"We really have a close-working relationship with the student government in this campus," Haynes said. "I have also found that spending time in the classrooms has helped me immensely ... getting a hand as to what students need [by] teaching the first year experience course on this campus." 

By getting the scoop on what's going on, he gets to help in many ways. 

"Dr. Haynes makes regular appearances in the Campus Life Office and checks with all members present to see what events we are planning," said Vanessa Robinson, director of Panther Power. 

Haynes has helped Panther Power in arranging meetings with the administration to promote athletic games and other events, according to Robinson. 

Haynes's past jobs have all been in the field of higher education administration, and he has held positions closely connected to students. 

One of the perks of the job is "interacting with people and making sure they are successful," he said. 

Haynes finds that his experience at FIU has been completely different compared to past jobs. 

"FIU is the most dynamic place where I have ever worked. We are dealing with residential populations, communal populations and traditional and non-traditional students," Haynes said. 

Haynes's positive attitude and respect for the FIU community, combined with his experience in administration, leaves a good impression on the people he works with. 

"Working with him has been an invaluable experience. Haynes is excellent at following up on issues and discussions," Linton said. 

Vice Provost Raul Moncarz agreed.

"Dr. Haynes is an excellent colleague to work with. His quality to work with people and willingness to work and help students is admirable and seldom found in Student Affairs," Moncarz said.

Haynes works hard to keep the team together and admits he never had a role model as a child. But now, he has someone new to believe in, his 20-month-old daughter, Faith: "[She's] the best thing that has happened to me," Haynes said. 

"Working here and just being part of this community is something very positive. I enjoy what I do; I enjoy the students and the faculty," he said.

Headline: Terri Schiavo guardian shares his experience at lecture
Author: Nicole Acosta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"I would sit with her and stroke her hair and hold her hand and I would take her head in my hands and beg her to help me help her," said Jay Wolfson, Dr. P.H., J.D. about his now former client, Theresa Schiavo.

As he talked about his personal thoughts and experiences of brain-damaged Schiavo's case Nov. 10, the FIU community sat, and stood, in Graham Center 140, silently listening to Wolfson's every  word.

Although the fight for Schiavo's future had been going on for years, Wolfson, professor of public health and medicine at the University of South Florida, came into the picture in 2003 as the court appointed Special Guardian ad Litem. 

He was the legal representative for Schiavo. He had a month to look through all of the legal and medical documents "of a woman I didn't know." He reported to Governor Jeb Bush and the courts as to whether or not Schiavo should have more swallowing tests administered. This would guide the governor in his decision-making about the case.

"I didn't follow the O.J. or the Schiavo case," said Wolfson. "All of a sudden, I am asked to inject myself into this thing."

Wolfson did more than just read 30,000 pages worth of documents. He turned to famous philosophers and writers such as Dante, Descartes and Nietzsche for answers. He spent time with Schiavo's family, the Schindlers and with Michael Schiavo, her husband. Wolfson also spent one to four hours a day with Schiavo.

"I was seeking both information and knowledge," he said.

Wolfson had many special tasks as Schiavo's Guardian ad Litem. One of them was to serve in the best interests of his ward. Wolfson said that the problem he had with that task was whether or not he should do what he, or someone else thought was best for Schiavo.

Another task Wolfson had was to determine if there was "feasibility and value in swallowing tests and swallowing therapy given the totality of the circumstances." Wolfson's problem with this was that value can be relative.

Wolfson had to make a decision concerning Schiavo's fate.

"The scientist in me had to come in," Wolfson said.

The rules given to Wolfson for his decision-making were clear. He had to give competent, clear and convincing evidence.

"We can take the best law we can and apply it in the best way we can. That is all we can do," Wolfson said.

Wolfson explained that when Schiavo had her accident, she fell and her brain was without oxygen for 12 minutes. She had slipped into a coma and was put on a respirator for a month. Two months later, she was considered vegetative. Schiavo could not swallow liquids.

Wolfson showed on a projector a picture of Schiavo's cerebral cortex. He explained that this was where reasoning is. It was where the consciousness may be and it was beyond reflexes. Schiavo's cerebral cortex was found to be all liquid.

"Her cerebral cortex was gone," Wolfson said. 

Finally, Wolfson's decision was made. He decided that additional testing could and would be done if everyone agreed in advance as to how the results were to be used. An agreement was never made.

From within the whirlwind, Wolfson discovered two things.

"I wound up learning that there was something about this case, and it involved a certain chemical - hope," Wolfson said. "Is hope maybe the ability of human beings to have something beyond yourself that is a part of you?"

Wolfson called this ability the divine spark.

"It's that special thing which makes us human," Wolfson said.

The second thing Wolfson discovered involved perspective.

"Much of what we see and hear is just the tip of the iceberg, and everyone will have different perspectives of the tip," he said. "What I do know is that things that are said and are represented are not the same."

As the lecture came to an end, Wolfson said he could see why life is so important to people. 

"The alternative is the unknown and could be not being," he said.

Headline: Gay characters emerging as macho types on film
Author: Jim Beckerman / The Record
&nbsp;
You better not make any remarks about Gay Perry. He'll kick your butt into next week.

He may like your butt. But he'll still kick it.

"You think that's funny? I'm gonna break your nose now," says Perry (Val Kilmer) to his bumbling straight buddy Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, a buddy-buddy detective movie with a double twist: Not only are the buddies gay and straight, but the gay guy is a two-fisted macho man, while his straight partner is a comic klutz.

And if you like gay detectives, how about gay cowboys (Brokeback Mountain, opening Dec. 9)?

And if you like gay cowboys, how about gay soccer players (Guys and Balls, opening in May)?

And if you like gay soccer players, how about a gay deaf white man and his African-American partner who are adopting a child (The Family Stone,"opening Nov. 4)?

Ready or not, here come the post-gay movies. And audiences do seem to be ready.

Ready for movies where the characters are not merely gay _ which used to be as much reality as mainstream viewers could take. These new characters are gay-hyphen.

Such characters have turned up occasionally in supporting roles in the past (James Gandolfini as a gay gangster in The Mexican, The Rock as a gay bodyguard in Be Cool). Now, they're center stage.

"Having a character be gay in a movie just isn't shocking anymore," said Shane Black, writer-director of Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, which is in some ways a queer variation on his own buddy-buddy Lethal Weapon movies.

"`Will and Grace' and `My Best Friend's Wedding' have softened us up with regards to the funny gay character," Black said. "`Well, all right, he's gay, but they're so funny, those gays.' And I thought, that doesn't really cut it. We still haven't seen the heroic gay character that, when the chips are down, kicks down the door, shoots everybody and saves your butt."

Whether these post-gay characters are also post-stereotype is open to question.

Gay Perry is a tough hombre who can slug his way out of a tight corner, but he's also got a cell phone that plays "I Will Survive" and a tiny Derringer pistol that he calls "my faggot gun."

And the soccer players in Guys and Balls, a German film that has been described as a kind of queer Full Monty, are a collection of gay "types": a leather guy, a flamboyant guy, a hunky guy, a nerdy guy.

But considered strictly as a barometer of audience attitudes, these films may be a kind of advance.

They suggest that mainstream viewers, by and large, no longer find gayness shocking or exotic enough to be of interest on its own. Like the coffee in your local convenience store, it has become humdrum. Hence the need for add-in flavors.

"People know gay people now, so it's not so much used for shock value," said Mark Reinhart, spokesman for Regent Releasing, which is distributing Guys and Balls. "It's more like this makes for interesting textures, or layers."

Regent and its sister company here!, a gay TV network, have been pioneering a new market: gay genre films.

While some of the movies they make or distribute are more traditional pieces like Summer Storm (a gay coming-of-age film) and April's Shower (about a lesbian relationship), they have also released niche films like Hellbent (a gay slasher film), Eternal (a lesbian vampire flick), Freshman Orientation (a gay Animal House) and the TV drama Tides of War, about a gay submarine captain.

While these films are aimed at gay audiences, some have had surprising crossover success.

"Fangoria (the horror cinema magazine) did whole pieces on Eternal and Hellbent," Reinhart said. "They were reviewed in every single mainstream paper in the country. It tells you there is a wide variety of interest in the film-going audience."

In Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,  Black exploits this new audience savvy about gay life to turn the conventions of the detective story upside-down.

"There is a lot of reality versus fiction in this film," Black said. "Like in reality, the tough guy is gay. In reality, you try to be the hero, you're going to get clobbered. So much of this was trying to stand the cliches of the tough guy movie on their head."

Meanwhile, if the chemistry between Kilmer and Downey proves as winning as the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the Lethal Weapon films, Gay Perry may be back.

"Depending on how much you like these guys, you may want to take another trip with them," Black said. "It's certainly fun to write about these characters."

Headline: North Country goes unnoticed at megaplex
Author: Daniel Carratala / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In the tradition of such defiant films as Erin Brockovich, Norma Rae and Rosewood, North Country tells the story of Aimes, played by Charlize Theron. 

Theron plays the mother of two children and the daughter of a mine worker. Since the beginning of the film, the audience quickly notices that Theron lives to work and works to live and is having trouble making ends meet. 

Facing constant disapproval from her family and trying to evade her violent ex, Theron faces a sobering wake-up call. 

Fortunately, things start looking up for her when a good friend advises her that the mine is hiring. The same mine that her father works in. 

A few weeks later, she begins work at the mine but quickly notices that something is terribly wrong. The men look at her and her female co-workers with lust in their eyes and make obscene gestures. 

Theron quietly brushes them off, as do the other ladies, and they all get back to their routines. At first, you almost want to side with the men because these women are so passive and submissive they let the men, metaphorically, get away with murder. 

Yet, as the film progresses and immature, adolescent and minute events snowball into great and horrific calamities, one cannot help but side with these poor women, no matter what.  

Throughout the movie, the audience is awe-struck by the grotesque and dangerous working environment that these ladies had to endure.  

However, at the time this ordeal took place, 1989, this country was very different. It has only been 16 years, which is a relatively short time when considering modern history; however, a lot has changed between then and now.  

So much has changed that one cannot even fathom the fact that events like these went unnoticed in workplaces throughout the country before any type of action was taken and before any type of legislation was passed.  

Thankfully, the performances by all of these actors tug at the heart strings and take us to this specific place in Minnesota in 1989, where women were being violated in so many ways. The direction is phenomenal and the script is pulled off remarkably by these A-list actresses.     

Unfortunately, due to its release date and the infamous box office slump that won't seem to go away, North Country debuted on the box office charts at number four with a measly $6.5 million dollars in revenue.  

Films like this one, that send rivers through tear ducts, usually don't have a big box office debut, but one would think differently when a film stars Oscar winners Charlize Theron, Sissy Spacek and Frances McDormand.  

Another pitfall that North Country might encounter is the fact that by the time Oscar nominations come around, this film may be long forgotten. 

Epic period films are usually released from late November up until early January in order to create Oscar buzz. Seeing as how North Country opened in mid-October and quickly faded away, it might not stand chance come Oscar season.

Headline: B-HIVE raises funds for children's charity
Author: Jennifer Mesa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Residence Hall Association has created project B-HIVE, an acronym for Be HIV Educated, in efforts to raise money for the Children's Home Society of Florida and create awareness of HIV/AIDS. The main fundraising event will be held Dec. 1, World AIDS Day, in the Housing Quad. 

The Children's Home Society conducts case management for children who have been abused, neglected or suffer health impairments such as HIV.  However, the B-HIVE committee is focusing on increasing HIV education because Miami-Dade County leads the country with the most people affected by HIV/AIDS.  

"It is important for the community to know these situations do exist in our community. There are many children right here in our community who need help," said Andrew Choban, developmental specialist for the Children's Home Society's southeastern division.

Currently, the B-HIVE committee and its volunteers are engaged in various fundraising activities.  So far, a combination of car washes, bake sales and canning  has led the group to raise almost half of its $5,000 goal. A large percent of profits has been due to the Student Programming Council, who has given the committee permission to can and table at all of their events.  

"We are here for the students and this is a great way to make them aware and educated," said SPC President Raj Maharaj. 

Other organizations involved include the Student Organizations Committee, which has donated money for t-shirts and flyers to be distributed on the day of the event; and Student Government Association, which paid for food provided by Shorty's BBQ. 

Student Government Association President Alex Prado, explained that he chose to become involved in the B-HIVE project because SGA is determined to partake in at least one community service event per semester.  

"We want to show care and want to be involved," Prado said.

Fundraising activities will culminate Dec. 1 with a series of entertaining and educational events organized by co-presidents Tamara Marryshow and Matthew Parisi, along with their advisor, Susan Onorato. 

The events will consist of testimonials by HIV survivors, free HIV testing by the South Beach AIDS Project, a power point presentation by the Health and Wellness Center, selling of raffle tickets, a seven-minute movie by the Children's Home Society, a performance by the band Hagus Magus, free food, free t-shirts and free condoms, courtesy of Planned Parenthood. At the end of the night, 95 percent of  proceeds will go directly to the Children's Home Society.  

The remaining 5 percent of the proceeds will be awarded to the winners of the banner contest. 

All FIU organizations are encouraged to get involved and make a banner stating the name of their organization, followed by "Supports the B-HIVE Project." The banners will be judged according to creativity and the winning organization's earnings will go toward the philanthropy of  its choice. The banner must be 5' x 3' and cannot be 3-dimensional.

Marryshow initiated this project because she "wanted to do something big."  The B-HIVE project aims to raise money for a local foundation and make a difference for someone in the community. 

"[The] honey of their efforts will be in the difference they have made in the lives that they will help," Marryshow said.

To become a committee member or volunteer for the B-HIVE project, or if you would like to share a personal HIV testimonial during the event, please e-mail theBHIVE@gmail.com.

Headline: War Stories
Subheadline: Jarhead sparks controversy between enlisted Marines
Author: Charlene Collazo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Oohrah", the U.S. Marine Corps chant, has become the trendiest word nowadays, all thanks to the new film, Jarhead, which opened Nov. 4.  

With the movie's increased popularity, hearing words such as the head and deck to refer to the bathroom and the floor would not be uncommon for civilians, but for Marines in the Corps, the movie has not gained that much popularity because they feel it creates more negative views of the Corps than positive ones.  

Jarhead, directed by Sam Mendes, who directed American Beauty, is based on the true story and book of ex-Marine Anthony Swofford. Portrayed by actor Jake Gyllenhaal, Swoffordis a young man who joins the Marine Corps, and is deployed to go fight in the  Gulf. War  When Swofford feels that he is not cut out to be a Marine, Sergeant Sykes, played by Jamie Foxx, tries to knock some sense into him.  The movie focuses on Swofford's enlistment into the Marine Corps, his personal life and what he eventually learns from the Corps.  

It's no surprise that this film would gain rave reviews from the younger female audiences who love to watch the young Gyllenhaal walking around shirtless, with his camouflage pants and dog tags.  

However, the movie has incited some concerns among Marines, who felt excited at first to see a new war movie that would truly describe the accounts of their daily life, and not just your usual "spot" and "kill" action.  Many feel that Jarhead depicts the Marine Corps in a negative way to audiences nationwide compared to the actual Swofford book that has its share of positive events.  

"This movie shows only the bad aspects of deployment or from being far way from the ones you love. All they show are girlfriends and wives being unfaithful such as in the "Wall of Shame." [The Wall of Shame is a bulletin board displayed in one of the war campsites that had all the pictures of girlfriends and wives of Marines who had cheated, kidnapped their kids or ended the relationship. The board was posted in the main war campsite with comments about them everywhere]. There is no attempt to show any motivation to come home to your loved ones," Pfc. Dennis Veater, Fort Leonard wood, Mo, Motor Transport Unit, said.  

Some are even concerned with how they describe what is expected of them in the Marine Corps, something they take very much pride in as shown through their motto, Semper Fidelis or "Always Faithful."  

"This movie shows Marines breaking the laws of war by shooting animals; it shows Marines disobeying orders. This is definitely not true," said Pfc. Richard J. Otero, Fort Leoanard wood, Mo., Motor Transport Unit.

However, not all Marines feel the movie portrayed them in a negative way.  Cpl. Jerry Velazquez, a Marine deployed during the Gulf War, said the movie was realistic in capturing how these men truly reacted at the time.  

"The movie tells the story of what happened to a specific group of Marines and their specific situation, which a lot of Marines have to deal with such as some of your average Marines not understanding why situations are handled in a certain way," Velazquez said.  

Marines, as well as some students, feel that this movie could have some negative effects to the war in Iraq. With one-third (36 percent) of the American population saying that our troops should come back home immediately, according to the latest polls by Fox News, war movies have the potential to "shake" the public consensus' views on wars that may be occurring at the time. 

Kaleena Carpenter, a sophomore and family member of current active-duty Marine, watched the movie Jarhead and believed it was great. However, she feels that this movie could affect public opinion of the Iraq war in a negative way.  

"This movie shows full details of the behavior of some Marines, which is considered not acceptable in my eyes, therefore people like me could be thinking if that is going on now," she said.  

What about the women?  Carpenter and other women noticed that the movie does not show any women training, serving or enlisting with the Marine Corps.  

Women serving in the Marine Corps have increased in recent years. According to the historical and museum division of the U.S. Marine Corps, 5.1 percent of women are currently in active-duty and 4.3 percent are officers.  

"Women were forgotten.  They also are giving their all out there to war and other duties each day.  They go through the same thing men go through and they play a big part," Carpenter said.  

Marines worry that the movie could discourage many individuals from enlisting in the Corps due to its negative portrayal in the film; showing the Corps to be worse than hell and a last resort to those who have nothing else in their life to do but struggle. 

MSNBC reported that since April 2005, the Marine Corps has missed its yearly recruiting goal by 2 percent, but it still hopes to recruit a total of 38,195 by the year 2005. The Iraqi War is blamed for the low recruiting numbers for some armed forces including the Marines.  Now, many see the movie as another determining factor that could contribute to this decreased enlistment.  

Is there anything inspirational grasped from the movie? Not for many Marines, and some humorously discuss scenes such as the use of the famous Santa Claus hat by the young Swofford during their Christmas Eve celebration scene. The celebration leaves him a little cold and in lots of trouble for his actions. 

"The only thing I learned from the movie is not to run around in a Santa Claus hat like Swofford did," Otero said.

I wholeheartedly agree that alcohol is not a necessity, however I do not agree with your author's attempt at bringing this to light. Thanks to her redundancy on the matter the article was handed about as a joke. Everyone read it and got in their laughs. Yes it did get a lot of people talking about it, but mostly they were discussing the hypocrisy so clearly exhibited by the author. She went on ad nauseum about how a good time could be had sober or with one or two drinks, then stated that even that wasn't safe and "some campus activities would never succeed without it". The absolute icing on the cake was the last paragraph that came completely out of left field and had no point whatsoever. But that's the whole problem, the article had no point, no argument, just opinions backed by more opinions. Maybe if some semblance of intelligence had been injected into this article it wouldn't have been the joke around GC yesterday. 

I'm an avid reader of the Beacon and I hate that drivel like this gets published.
