Headline: Football ticket sales steadily increase
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Jan Allen, the new Associate Director of Athletics, and the athletic department will be introducing a new internet ticketing system which FIU will be using for the inaugural football season. "We're the first college football program in the nation to begin using this system" Allen informed. 

Ticket Return is a two-year old program based in Charlotte, North Carolina. With this system, fans buy their tickets online with a credit card, print them from their homes or pick them up at the stadium box office. The system also makes counting attendance electronically easier, giving a more accurate number.

"For season ticket-holders, the biggest innovation is replacing season tickets with a plastic card," Gordon Hirsch, Ticket Return's Vice President, said. "Instead of getting a book of tickets, they get cards with their names and seating assignements that they can carry in their wallets like credit cards." 

There is a $1.50 fee for purchasing the tickets online. Students can receive complimentary tickets with their school ID's. 

"Everything is barcoded even the paper you print out," Allen explained. "The ticketing will also be done by priority. Seniors and juniors will get first pick. Under this system, we have spent under $60,000 versus the quarter of a million it usually costs programs to spend when starting up a football program." 

Currently, the athletic department has 2,907 committments for season tickets, up from less than a thousand a year ago. Many of the sales have come from corporations. But athletics is not satisfied with that number. Advertising at local movie theatres as well as on Florida's turnpike will be placed within the next few weeks.

"We're very happy. We're the only on-campus stadium program in South Florida and we don't charge for parking," Allen said.

FIU Community Stadium has recently been expanded and will have a seating capacity of just under 18,000. 

"Considering our history (of poor attendance at athletic events), we're very pleased," Athletics Director Rick Mello said. "I think we've done pretty well so far. You have to keep things in perspective."

 "The two main reasons we added football were to enhance campus life for our students and to create an emotional attachment to our alumni and we plan on doing that. Our goal is 5,000. We're still aiming for that. I'm feeling good about it." 

Student involvement will be emphasized. According to Allen and Mike Garrity, the Assistant Athletic Director for Students, Campus and Alumni Relations, greeks will be hosting a game along with the SOC and SGA. 
Plans are in the works for block seating for organizations as well as for competitions between clubs to see which has the most attendance. In years past, $2,500 was awarded to the organization which had the most attendance. 

"We expect a sellout on August 29th for the inaugural game," Allen said. 
"We want the students to come out because it's your team. This is for you."

Headline: Viegas has surgery, out up to six months; Sun Belt signs TV agreement with ESPN
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
FIU men's basketball guard/forward Rodrigo Viegas will be lost to the team for the next six months after undergoing successful ACL reconstruction and medial meniscus repair surgery earlier this week.

Viegas injured himself while working out in his hometown of Belo Horizonte, Brazil earlier this summer. Doctors there performed an MRI and diagnosed a partial ACL tear of the left knee. Viegas wore a brace for several weeks without improvement.

 The 6'5" senior returned to Miami where team physician Dr. John Zvijac performed surgery at HealthSouth Doctor's Hospital.

 "I feel bad for Rod because he was coming off an outstanding season
last year and emerged as our floor leader," said FIU head coach Donnie Marsh. "I know it's disappointing to him, but he's a focused individual.
He's on track to graduate this December and we're expecting him to be at 100-percent by the time the Sun Belt Conference schedule begins in January.

The Golden Panthers open their 2003 Sun Belt schedule on Sunday, Jan. 5, at home against North Texas&#8212;the program that ended FIU's season last year at the league championships.

"For a program like ours, it's important that we're playing our best come conference time," said Marsh. "If Rodrigo's activation gives us a shot of energy, we'll take that and run with it."

Viegas transferred to FIU from Virginia Tech in the fall of 2000. As a junior, last year he averaged 13.4 points and six rebounds while starting 29 of the Golden Panther's 30 games. 
Viegas became only the 18th FIU men's basketball player to score more than 400 points in a single season (he finished with 402 points) and joined Taurance Johnson as the first Golden Panther teammates to both tally 400-or-more points in the same year.

The Golden Panthers finished with a 10-20 record.

Sun Belt signs TV agreement with ESPN.

The Sun Belt Conference has entered into a six-year agreement with ESPN to televise regular season college football and basketball games, the league announced Tuesday afternoon. 

The deal, which begins during the 2002-03 academic year and continues through 2007-08, features a combination of regional telecasts of football and basketball produced through ESPN Regional Television, as well as national football exposures on ESPN and ESPN2 beginning with the 2003 season. 

"We are excited to both extend and expand our relationship with the Sun Belt Conference," said Chuck Gerber, ESPN Regional Television executive vice president and general manager.

Headline: Nealer, Owens head north for tournament
Author: Pete Pelegrin/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Imagine being given the unexpected chance to ascend to the pinnacle of your profession or of the sport you love the most. 

For a sportswriter, it may be to write for Sports Illustrated.  For a softball player, outside of competing in the Olympics, it would be to play with the world's best softball players at the Canada Cup. 

Amanda Nealer and Jennifer Owens are two of the top players on the FIU Softball team, and the summer of 2002 will be one that they'll remember. 

From July 13th to the 21st, the two Golden Panthers joined the Florida Sun Sox to compete against the world's elite softball players at the Canada Cup in Surrey, British Columbia. 

Established in 1993, the Canada Cup is a round robin tournament pitting the world's best teams.  It is similar to the Olympics, without all the pomp and circumstance. 

"Playing all these big teams is a great experience," Nealer, who led the Golden Panthers with a 1.09 ERA last year, said.  "This is kind of our Olympics.  It's a pretty big achievement." 

"This is probably my biggest softball achievement to be able to play with Olympians," Owens, who plays 1st and 3rd base for FIU, said.  "Seeing all these top players makes me want to try harder to get on the Olympic team." 

Nealer and Owens got the chance to experience the Canada Cup thanks, in part, to FIU softball head coach Kim Gywdir and a little bit of fate. 

The Sun Sox head coach Marge Ricker had a pitcher back out at the last minute and was also in need of a first baseman. 

"Marge Ricker called me and said she had been hearing all these good things about Amanda from other coaches in the area," Gywdir, who was at the Canada Cup recruiting, said.  "She was also in need of a first baseman and I told her what a good choice Jennifer would be and she took her as well." 

A few years ago, another couple of former FIU players participated in the Canada Cup.  Last year's starting centerfielder Lesley Gillen and pitching ace Vanessa Preston made the trip to Canada, previously. 

Before they got the call, Nealer and Owens were going about their business during the summer. 

Nealer was rehabbing a couple of injuries. 

The sophomore left-hander was nursing her hip and clavicle, which were injured as a result of compensating for sore muscles during the past softball season. 

She had a bone scan and a MRI done on her troublesome hip. 

Owens' summer was not filled with days at the beach watching the waves crash on the shore, but instead she was working out for her upcoming FIU volleyball season and helping to coach her sister's softball team. 
The junior first baseman/middle blocker on the volleyball team didn't have much spare time when she got the call from Gywdir. 

"I thought it would be a great opportunity to play with the top players," Owens said.  "Meeting different teams from other parts of the world and watching how they play was neat." 

"Both Amanda and Jennifer are good enough to play at that level and they belong on the same playing field with a powerhouse team such as Australia," Gywdir said. 

Once Nealer and Owens got to British Columbia, they faced different experiences with the surrounding environment, but the same ones on the playing field. 

Nealer, who is from Everett, Washington, was just ninety minutes away from home. 

"British Columbia is alot like home, because it's so close," Nealer said.  
"It was nice to go home and see my family on a day off."

Yet Nealer was surprised in front of large crowds. The nine day tournament averaged 110,000 in attendance. 

"It was weird playing for a lot of fans," Nealer said.  "Even the Canadian people are rooting for us." 

The Canadians were probably just as inquisitive of Owens, a Miami native. 

"It's another country out here," Owens said.  "There's cool weather and the sun doesn't go down until 10 pm and I got a chance to do some sightseeing on a mountain.  There are not too many mountains in Miami." 

What both ladies did not get a chance to do much was play softball.  Since Nealer and Owens were part of a group of younger players on the team and since Ricker, a regular coach, told the team: "If you're not out of college, then you're not mature enough."

Owens, who led the Golden Panthers with 33 RBI's and was second in hits with 61 last season, did play first base, but her chances were minimal. 

"If you didn't know the coach well, then you weren't going to get much of a chance," Owens said. 

When Owens did get into the game she faced some quality pitching. 

"The pitching was tough, but I've seen it before," Owens added.  "Australia is dominant and maybe the U.S. Olympic team has better pitching." 

Pitching is the reason Nealer was selected to play in the Canada Cup, yet her pitching outing was scarce as well. 

"Everything has been fun, the girls are great, but not playing is not fun," Nealer said. 

Nealer got her first chance to get into a game when she was warming up in the bullpen versus Canada.  

When Ricker summoned her to come into the game Nealer was not ready. 

Because she is recovering from her injuries, Nealer takes extra time to warm up; but Ricker didn't think so. 

"I need more time than the other pitchers right now, because I have to watch it with my hip," Nealer said.  "So when she (Ricker) called for me I wasn't ready and then when I was ready she (Ricker) said she didn't need me." 

"The last thing I told Amanda before she left was be careful with the hip," Gywdir said.  "Some coaches are old school and think it only takes five pitches to warm up and that's not the case nowadays." 

When Nealer finally did get into a game she threw two scoreless innings against the Australian Olympic team. 

"I thought Australia was the toughest team just because they hit the crap out of the ball," Nealer added. 

The U.S. Olympic team ended winning the tournament beating the U.S. Elite team. 

The Sun Sox finished the Canada Cup with a record of 2-3 and did not qualify for the championship round. 

Still, the whole exposure to world class softball will be a benefit to both Nealer and Owens. 

"It's a tremendous experience to play with people of that caliber," Gywdir, who is in her fifth year of coaching FIU softball, said.  "There are not too many tournaments like that in the world for softball." 

"The Canada Cup is basically the World Series of softball," Gwydir added. 

"It's the best of the best and its something that should give both Amanda and Jen a tremendous amount of confidence and help them in the future."

Headline: Gay adoption ban should not be lifted
Author: Randy Ball/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
There are three reasons I believe the Florida law banning gay adoption should remain on the books.  

No. 1 is a religious reason.  I think any honest debate on this issue has to take into consideration the influence that religion has on public policy.  Throughout our society is the deeply rooted Judeo-Christian ethic that holds that homosexuality is immoral and that we should not put children into that environment.  It's what I believe in and it's what I think most of my colleagues in the legislature believe in.   

Do I have a right to mix religion and politics? Absolutely. Legislators reflect their constituency. A legislator who believes, or who has a constituency that believes in the Judeo-Christian ethic should come forward and uphold those principles. That's not wrong. In fact, it would be hypocritical to abandon my religious values when I go into office.  

Second, the Constitution supports the right of states to ban gay adoption. I believe that the law would withstand scrutiny because the compelling constitutional interest is not a perceived right for a gay person to adopt, but it is the right of the child to be in a wholesome environment. 

The constitutional issue is simply this: What is in the best interest of that child?  You can talk about degrading attitudes and naked prejudice all you want.  

But I can tell you that the 160 Florida state representatives and senators are interested chiefly in the well being of the child. That is the constitutionally prevailing issue.

Third, there is an overwhelming weight of scientific evidence that the homosexual lifestyle is unwholesome. 

The gay lifestyle is a dangerous lifestyle for a child. The International Journal of Epidemiology has found significantly higher incidences of suicide, depression, disease, domestic violence and multiple partners in homosexual relationships as compared with heterosexual counterparts. It's a longstanding principle that if a bedroom has a revolving door, it's disruptive to the kids.   

A Canadian study found that the average 20-year-old homosexual man could expect to live eight to 20 years less than his heterosexual counterpart. The gay-oriented New York Blade newspaper says that gay men occupy the highest risk factors for all sexually transmitted diseases and it's getting worse because their lifestyles are getting riskier. 

Nowhere is this more tragically illustrated than in New Jersey, where the state first approved a case of gay adoption. A young boy was adopted as an infant.  As he got to be age 5, he got to watch both of his fathers grow sick with AIDS and die within three months of each other in 1992.  

The paramount interest here is the safety and the well-being  &#8211; physically, emotionally and psychologically &#8211; of the child.    Children are our greatest treasures.  They need to be jealously protected against the tide of political correctness that sees a child only as a potential trophy in a  fight to change the American traditional model of the family.  The Florida law should stand.

Headline: Bright futures turn bleak
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
"Dear Student, Congratulations! We in Tallahassee would like to promise you an education in a state university, provided you maintain a good grade point average and follow the rules previously established by the state university system."

Sounds great. Sounds like a real stride in the right direction towards remedying Florida's educational woes. Not only are students going to have a shot at gaining a higher education, but they're going to have the state of Florida there to back them up with the increasingly expensive costs of a college education.  This was the semi-misleading promise put forth by the Bright Futures Scholarship Program.

I must say, I was overjoyed to hear about the program. Being from a middle-class family that unable to afford a four-year college education for me, the Bright Futures Scholarship Program came as a blessing. Since I have been at FIU, I have taken full advantage of the program. Even this summer, I was taking advantage of the Bright Futures opportunities as were afforded to me by the State, or so I thought. 

After going through all of Summer A and doing well in my classes, I was then enlightened as to the latest amendment to the Bright Futures Scholarship Program. It turns out that as of late, the state legislature has decided that Bright Futures cannot pay for summer term education. State funds would apparently be better utilized elsewhere than our universities.

The funny part is that in order to graduate from a state university in Florida, you must attend a summer term.

The fact is: Florida's track record on education is absolutely despicable. The Miami Herald recently reported that we have become 49th in the nation in per-student spending. 

The Florida Chamber of Commerce even admitted that we would need to spend 18 percent more per year simply to bring the grades K-12 "closer in line with the national median." 

We aren't talking about becoming the top spender in the country; we're talking about just achieving mediocrity. 

Our educations themselves have borne the brunt of the effects. Florida is ranked 49th in high school graduations. 

Our SAT scores have dropped from 44th in the nation to 46th. The Miami Herald also reported that our ACT scores were "the lowest in a decade." About 40 percent of Florida high school grads were deemed not prepared for basic college-level courses last fall. 

We are second to last in education. It is not as if we are some small state or some backwoods wasteland. This is Florida, a perpetual player in national politics (2000 election), culture and home to millions of people. We should be toward the top of the heap, not in 49th place.

There is no question about the role of our governor, Jeb Bush, in our deteriorating educational system. 

His track record as our "education governor" is even worse than the state's as a whole. He has introduced policy after policy that have all done one of two things: either directly hurt our educational systems or deprived them of truckloads of money. 

To those students who have been hurt by the newest Bright Futures funding policy, may I suggest that you rethink that vote for Governor Bush in November. 

Whether all of your education or only a part of it is funded by the Bright Futures Scholarship, if you needed to take classes this summer, you got first-hand knowledge of the decaying educational system in Florida. 

The maelstrom that the students in Florida get caught in is not only one that they sometimes can't help, but one that is increasingly hard to doggy-paddle their way out of. 

Our governor's own famous brother put it best, "Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?"

Headline: In Our View: Broken call boxes should have been replaced sooner
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
There is no denying the necessity for working call boxes on college campuses, especially on campuses with student populations as large as this one. Students can use them when a car breaks or when they fear for their safety.

For over a year, FIU has allowed out of service call boxes in the Gold Parking Garage to remain broken. Although the university has promised to install new boxes by the start of the fall semester, the fact remains that such an important issue should not have been ignored for such a prolonged period of time. 

In hindsight, the university is merely lucky that no student was adversely affected by the broken call boxes. That is not to say, however, that ignoring broken call boxes does not constitute a gross disservice to students on the part of FIU.  

The main reason why the call boxes have not been replaced or repaired sooner is apparently yet another adverse affect of FIU's recent funding difficulties.  While it's understandable that funding is a legitimate concern,   the fact remains that an issue as pressing as broken call boxes,  should receive timely attention.  

Waiting over a year to address the problem is not timely consideration, but simply poor administration.  

A large number of students have felt concern over the lack of working call boxes in the Gold Garage. These students are afraid for their safety when walking to their cars at night. This fact alone should have caused a more immediate response from the university, which students trust to look after their best interest.

It is understandable that a bureaucracy takes time to solve certain problems. But this is not acceptable when dealing with issues that so directly involve student safety. The safety aspect has to take precedent over the cost – no matter the inconvenience, in terms of budget, that it may cause.

Headline: Sigma Phi Epsilon hosts fourth wrestling childrens'charity event
Subheadline: Funds raised for Children's Miracle Network
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With a crowd of over 650 spectators, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity hosted its fourth SigEp Wrestling Federation charity event on Sunday night at the Graham Center ballrooms. The event raised $3,343 for the Children's Miracle Network. 

"It was a very new and innovative way of raising money," Biology Major Miguel Villalobos said.

Yamil Piedra, a theater major, founded the event when he first rushed Sigma Phi Epsilon in 1997. 

But there were challenges ahead for Piedra. Other members of the fraternity and FIU administration originally discarded the idea because of liability issues and possible injuries.

"A lot of people thought it would be a joke beacuse of the danger level and what might occur," Piedra said. "I ignored them and proceeded to talk to the [former Greek advisor] and got it approved."

One year later, they held the first event. 

"I've always loved wrestling and I thought it would be a great way to raise money and have fun," Piedra, who also plays the character of Arkon, said. 

Sunday's event started out with a dance performance by the ladies of the SWF.

Match one was a tag team battle, followed by two matches with individual wrestlers. After that was a miscellaneous match before the official tag team championship match. The evening concluded with the SWF heavyweight championship match, won by J-Spice.

"Wrestling is like a soap opera. It's theater with extreme stage combat," Piedra said. 

Every wrestler who performed was professionally trained. For the last event, they trained with Duke "The Dumpster" Droese, a former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler. This year, they trained with Rusty Brooks, another veteran of the WWE. 

Training was paid for by both the Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter and the individual fraternity members involved in the show. 

"We are at the point that we can basically train ourselves now. Our training has been incredible," Piedra said. 

At the first SWF match back in 2001, called "Summer Rage, Redemption," the fraternity raised approximately $2,000 for the charity. 

"It has helped the lives of many people especially the ones of this particular foundation," University Park Student Government President Jessica Morffi, said. 

In 1997, the money raised was originally going to be donated to the United Way. However, Sigma Phi Epsilon decided it would be better to support the Children's Miracle Network. 

"FIU already supports the CMN through the Dance Marathon, so we figured it would be better to keep it in the FIU community and help them out also," fraternity member William Vance said. Vance played the character of the SWF president. "This way we also know and can see where the money is going to.

"The money that was being donated to the United Way was going toward keeping abortion clinics open," Vance said. "Some of the brothers were against it for religious issues."

Locally, CMN works closely together with Miami Children's Hospital. The international non-profit organization is dedicated to helping children by raising funds and awareness for 170 children's hospitals throughout North America, treating more than 17 million children afflicted with diseases, injuries and birth defects.   

"We take bumps, falls, trips and spills and it's all for the kids," Jonathan Gaviria said, who played the role of wrestler Dexter Modem.

Headline: North Miami camps hit BBC
Author: Marcela Levy / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Wet puddles outlining little feet decorate the hallway floors of the Wolfe University Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus. Since the beginning of June, BBC has been playing host to a number of North Miami's summer camp programs such as Beth Torah, Temple Menorah, Creative Camps, Brouser Maimonides Academy and FIU's Children's Sports Camp. 

Each camp offers different activities throughout the day. 

The children from FIU's Children's Sports Camp have a chance to swim, go cayaking, do arts and crafts as well as play other sports.

With the Creative Camps children and teenagers use the Mary Ann Wolfe Theatre to put on two performances in the summer. During an eight week period, they practice magic, dancing, acting and other talents.

The other camps divide their time with a variety of other activities and some only come to use the pool and cafeteria facilities. 

The campers seem to enjoy spending time at FIU. 

"We love the big screen television in the WUC and the pool is great for the kids too," Temple Menorah Counselor Jessie Moskowitz said.

But, the number of children on campus has caused concerns for many students. 

"This is a college campus," junior Daniel Schemer said, "and there are seven and eight year olds running around in wet towels eating popsicles." 

"There are about twenty kids for each counselor to take care of," Moskowitz said, "depending on which division each counselor has, and the age may range between four to 12 years." 

 In the afternoon, the camps take turns gathering at the cafeteria for lunch.

"The noise in the cafeteria is horrible," senior Zukina Contreras said. "They make eating lunch in there unbearable." 

"Sometimes the kids do get out of control, but we try our best to keep them quiet," Moskowitz said.

Students and staff have filed many complaints on the campers. 

"We respond to complaints and make an effort to keep the noise down," Access Service Librarian Steve Switzer said. 

Beth Torah senior camp counselor Brian Papa does not think the complaints are reasonable. He said most of the activities take place in the pool area so the kids don't spend a lot of time inside any of the university buildings.

WUC Information Center Acting Supervisor Joni Todd said she is at the booth all the time and can see the children running around the halls throughout the day. 

"They are very distracting and disruptive," Todd said, "and sometimes can cause hazards for those who are disabled [and] trying to get by them." 

Lisa Baldwin, director of Creative Camps said her campers stay in the theatre most of the time. 

"They also follow an activities schedule, which is very structured and keeps them busy," she said.

There have also been complaints from students in other buildings. 

Senior Felicia Averbauch said she was angered when, during a crucial test in the Academic One building, "The kids were knocking on the door, sticking their faces to the window and being really loud." 

The professor was forced to leave the room during the test to tell the counselors to please take the children somewhere else, Averbauch said. 

Traffic had also been an issue, especially around the library, which was designated as the pick up and drop off spot for many of the children. While waiting for their parents, they would run in front of the library doors and sometimes dangerously close to the street. But when complaints about the traffic arose, the camps changed their pickup route to behind WUC in an effort to appease all parties involved, Camp Temple Menorah's head of activities Esther Mitrani said.

Mitrani said she disagrees with most of the negative statements about the camps. 

"We try to keep our kids away from the students' study area – especially the classrooms," Moskowitz said. 

Many students and faculty feel that the camps add a positive atmosphere and are a sign of life in a mostly unoccupied campus during the summer, Switzer said.

"I'm just glad to see the campus as vital as possible," she said. 

Junior Maria Goyen said as long as the children do not affect her studies, she sees no issue with the camps on campus at all. 

Senior Library Technician of Interlibrary and Intercampus Loans, Annya Polselli has her son in one of the camps and said the camps are, "a good service for parents and a source of income for Biscayne Bay." 

BBC pool's head lifeguard, Jonathan Torrey, said he has seen quieter times at the pool, but the children are not a major problem. He approves of the summer camps and sees them as a good advertisement for BBC 

"A lot of people don't know we have a pool," Torrey said. "We get more exposure."

Headline: Wellness Center expands services to CEAS
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's Health and Wellness Center recently conducted a two-day survey at the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences to get a feel for what kinds of services students on the campus would utilize if made available there. 

Currently, the Health and Wellness Center offers its services exclusively to the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. 

Recognizing that engineering students must combat stress and other wellness issues along with the rest of FIU, Wellness Coordinator Mariela Gabaroni said, "I don't want these students to miss out on the services we have to offer."     

On the survey, students were asked about the type of services they would like to have access to. They were also asked to rate the different stresses currently in their lives. 

The center's employees, who are currently studying for a master's degrees in Public Health, completed tabulating the results of the surveys toward the end of last week. 

These statistics were not immediately available. 

Only the Random Acts of Wellness program and certain workshops are scheduled to be available at the College of Engineering.

One of the reasons why Random Acts of Wellness, which began at the University Park campus this past January, was chosen to be done at CEAS is because of its simplicity. 

"It's very feasible to go over there and hand out the messages," Gabaroni said.

Every month or so, she explained the Health and Wellness Center employees walk around campus, targeting the more populous places such as the Graham Center. They offer students candy or a stress ball attached to a little message giving tips or a little known fact about health issues including consumption of water and sexual safety.

During finals last semester, Random Acts of Wellness handed out smoothies attached to a message suggesting ways to combat the stress studying tends to cause in students during exams.

Also included was the recipe for the smoothie, in case a student later wanted to make one himself. 

The center will offer lectures dealing with a variety of topics including eating for more energy, dietary supplements, brain food, men's health, women's health and osteoporosis.

A current concern for the center is its location in the College; the school is already tight on space. That also prevents certain Health and Wellness programs and classes from being moved onto the campus. 

"Currently, many departments [in the college] are being shuffled around, so nobody can say where anything will be," Engineering Student Council President Mariana Espinosa said. 

Because they don't currently have a home location in the school, Health and Wellness programs such as fitness testing will not be offered at the College of Engineering. 

"Right now, we have to think out of a box," Gabaroni said.

Assuming that all of these issues are ironed out and confirmed with the college's administration, Random Acts of Wellness and the workshops are expected to begin in time for the fall semester.

Subheadline: Call boxes out for 18 months
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the past 18 months, the emergency call boxes in the Gold Parking Garage have been malfunctioning and replacement boxes will not be installed until the start of the new semester.

Alessandro Bagnara, student government's student services chair, brought this matter to the attention of Student Government Council President Jessica Morffi.

"As soon as the concern was brought to my attention, I put it on the agenda for the upcoming student government meeting," she said.

The meeting took place July 12, when it was decided that the call boxes should be replaced.

The call boxes are expected to be replaced within the next three months.

Funding is one of the main reasons it has taken a long time to get the call boxes replaced. 

Paul Gallagher, executive vice-president of business and finances, has asked Assistant Director of Facilities Operations Gregory Burdine-Coakley to expedite the project. However, it will take time. The university first needs to receive proposals and bids, which take up to 30 days, to see which company will have the lower price. 

"The project is estimated to cost $45,000," Burdine-Coakley, who is also the call boxes project manager, said. 

There are a total of 20 boxes in the Gold Parking Garage. Each floor contains four call boxes. They are located on the walls next to the stairs and currently have "out of order" signs taped over them.

The decision was made to replace the call boxes, rather than fix the current devices. The new call boxes will be the same models as the ones in the Blue Parking Garage.

"It is necessary that the boxes get fixed," said Morffi.

"The emergency call boxes are extremely important in case of an emergency," Burdine-Coakley said.

The call boxes are a concern for students as well.

"I take some evening classes, and I almost always park in the Blue Garage where the call boxes work. It's really dangerous for a female student to be in a dark parking lot at night," business major Karla Montes said.

Public Safety can also assist someone who has locked their keys in their car or someone with car trouble.

"I tend to sometimes forget my keys inside my car and have to wait for my friends to get out of class to help me," engineer major Rene Mendoza said. "I didn't know Public Safety could help."  

"When I found out the boxes were not working I was somewhat worried and scared," microbiology major Alissa Cohan said. "I usually walk with some friends to my car now."

Aside from replacing the emergency call boxes in the Gold Parking Garage, Morffi has also asked that all campus call boxes be checked out.

"All the call boxes need to be in good working order," Morffi said.

Morffi has also proposed that call boxes be placed at the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences building located on 107th Ave and Flagler street. That campus currently does not have any call boxes. 

"It'll cost approximately $10,000 to add the call boxes over at the School of Engineering [sic]," Burdine-Coakley said.

Headline: "I Love You" redefines modern love
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
There are few perfect things in this crazy little world: chocolate covered almonds, sunsets shared with someone you love, "Casablanca," "Catcher in the Rye," the third season of "The Simpsons," and that perfect moment of triumph when you manage to finish The New York Times crossword puzzle without having to bust the kneecaps of its creators in order to find out what six letter word also means "to mollify." 

"I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change," the musical revue now showing at the Actor's Playhouse in the Miracle Mile, is not perfect, but it tries so relentlessly to put a smile on your face that resisting would be downright mean. It's like that cute little niece that wants to inform you that babies don't come from storks. It's not saying anything you didn't already know, but it's pretty hard not to feel all warm and fuzzy anyway.

The show, a collection of mock-Broadway tunes and punch-free comedy skits loosely tied by the theme of sexual relationships (in and out of the bedroom), is wonderfully harmless. 

It's already staggeringly successful because, after all, it sings back to the audiences everything they want to hear about themselves: "You may be single and overweight, but you're still a winner. Love will come to you in the end no matter what. Compromise." Some critics have gone so far as to call the show "a musical Seinfeld," but I'm assuming that's after Seinfeld's lobotomy.

What "I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change" does share with Seinfeld is that rarified universe of upper-middle class Jewishness where everyone is fairly affluent, everyone is fairly neurotic and everyone kvetches about dating and mating while playing tennis. 

That sounds harsh, but "I Love You" is actually a very funny musical within those boundaries, and if it lacks depth, at least it makes up for it in width. From the hilarious opening song, "Cantata for a First Date," to the title track that ends the show, the music does its best to freshen up familiar ideas with playful tunes that all but bounce off the stage, combining old-fashioned Broadway song-making with lyrics that could have been penned by Dave Barry.

Although most of the songs are catchy and witty enough to pass the test, the funniest must be "Tear Jerk." In it, a guy bravely tries to withstand the tear-jerking might of a chick-flick. Not to mention that the song actually rhymes the names "Sylvester Stallone" and "Bruce Willis." 

The most touching song is "I Can Live with That," in which an elderly man finds love at the funeral home (no, it's not a song about necrophilia). 

Both those characters are played by Stephen G. Anthony, who could very well be a renegade X-Man, judging by his uncanny ability to play anything that's thrown his way.

Rounding out the cast are Wayne LeGette as the other man, and Margot Moreland and Stacy Schwartz as the two women. The four of them juggle more than a dozen transformations between them, stretching their acting ranges like chameleons on speed. 

If only the show had been as versatile as they are, testing deeper waters with a more daring toe. Oddly enough for a musical that claims to cover the full range of contemporary relationships, there isn't a single gay character, or a minority character, or for that matter, anyone that isn't perfectly proper and predictable.

And that, of course, is an imperfection. Now all we need is a change.

Headline: "Eight Legged Freaks" a campy delight
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
There's that old saying: "check your brain at the door." It usually applies to paquetes, those big- budget action flicks where Bruce Willis evades about 50 trillion bullets coming out of three pistols, and movies starring Martin Lawrence. These films are the kinds that easily appease the masses, but drive critics up the wall. How exactly does one find the pros in a film that's nothing more than a blatant commercial for McDonald toys?

But there's that other "check your brain at the door" genre, the kind where the worse the movie is, the better it can be. B-movies are caught in that awkward paradox, a tangent universe where good is bad and bad is good. Because of this strange little situation, objectivity gets thrown out the window; one person's "so bad it's good" is another person's "so bad it's bad." In other words, it's tough to review B-movies.

It's even tougher to review "Eight Legged Freaks" because it's less of a B-movie and more of a heterogeneous concoction, with homage and parody intermingled without ever straying too much toward either direction. "Freaks" is a throwback to the Fifties-style films where giant mutated creatures invade a small town. It also pays homage to the exact same films it's attempting to recreate in a modern sense. At the same time, "Freaks" lampoons the genre's excessive silliness by retaining a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor about the pure stupidity within B-movies. However, it never actually insults the genre's conventions, like spoofs such as "Scary Movie" or  "Not Another Teen Movie" did. It's so completely hybrid, that every person in the audience is likely to taste a different ingredient in the stew and base their decision on it.

In "Freaks," giant spiders invade a small mining town in the Southwest, surrounded by Los Alamos-esque desert and mountains. These growing arachnids are the result of a hapless (and soon-to-be dead) spider farmer feeding them mutant crickets from a contaminated pond. 

Of course, these suckers aren't nice giant spiders. They're literally suckers, blood suckers. And as they grow, so do their appetites, starting with cats, moving on to ostriches, and eventually, the town folk. So the town folk run and die and make wise-cracks and hide in a mall. That's pretty much the whole movie.

The main characters, who are trying to escape, along with the rest of the town, are the clichés you'd expect in these films but with slight twists. The loner hero who returns to a town he deserted years ago (David Arquette) is also a hopeless loser who gets panicky about everything. The sexy female (Kari Wurher) is the stronger authority figure, (a headstrong sheriff). The danger-prone characters always getting into trouble are male: either a paranoia-induced radio DJ (Doug E. Doug) or the horn-dog boyfriend of the sheriff's daughter. Even the scientist is a little bit different; rather than being an actual scientist, he's the nerdy son of the sheriff, who learned everything he knows about spiders from the aforementioned doomed spider farmer.

"Eight Legged Freaks" is a bad movie. But if you go in knowing that it's stupid and hokey and cheesy, you'll find an enjoyable popcorn flick that seems to be having a good time. A cross between "Gremlins" fun and "Tremors" trashy camp, "Eight Legged Freaks" is the epitome of great cheese you can catch on the Sci-Fi Channel at 3 am. Perhaps the only thing missing is Mike, Tom Servo and Crow.

Headline: Wilco's latest dissects communication
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
Back in 1994, four guys got together to become the band known as Wilco, (short for "will comply.") Eight years later, they have released their sixth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, a disc that picks up where their last album, Summerteeth, left off. Previously, Wilco was known for their alternative country tunes, but the band has changed its sound, music, lyrics and theme. Some have compared their music to the Barenaked Ladies and John Mellencamp, but with Wilco's new sound, they've become truly unique.

"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" is a highly listened-to short-wave radio station operated by Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. These stations have played an essential role in allowing Mossad to communicate with agents by broadcasting one-way transmissions in a female's voice; only the voice is computer-generated. Automatic machines do the actual announcing, sending out a seemingly eternal stream of messages. So what's the connection between Mossad and Wilco? It's actually pretty clever.

Wilco uses short-wave radio as a metaphor for communication in a relationship. Short-wave radio allows people to speak without necessarily being in physical proximity. But at the same time, there's no guarantee that the coded messages will be received successfully, and listeners know that atmospheric interference may naturally occur. The same goes for those involved in relationships. Often times, their communication is deficient and obscure, which of course is the experience of those relying on radio. Even if you think you understood the message correctly, there is always the possibility that you completely missed the point. Wilco's new album explores these communication barriers through their music and lyrics. 

With that knowledge, it is understandable why the first track, "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart," opens with a hum disrupted by a drum, an alarm, chimes and some musical instruments that keep it from getting too annoying. Suddenly, we hear the voice of an exhausted man, trying to sing through the surrounding noise. 

Fitting in well with the theme of the album, the point here is for the listeners to have difficulty in distinguishing the words. The song goes on to describe a confused relationship where the singer expresses insecurity about separating from his lover before self-destructively confessing: "I am trying to break your heart / But still I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy." With the musical tension in the background, the words become that much more powerful because almost anyone in a relationship can somehow relate.

The album's title is central to the penultimate track, "Poor Places," where the broadcast is actually presented.  The singer seems cut off from and confused by his own life: "There's bourbon on the breath of the singer you love so much / He takes all his words from the books you don't read anyway / His jaw's been broken, his bandages wrapped too tight / High fangs have been pulled, and I really wanna see you tonight." 

Following the singer's repeated wishes to be with his lover is this self-defeating statement: "And it's hot in the poor places tonight / I'm not going outside" – meanwhile, a female computer voice begins repeating "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" while the singer sings and the noise gradually overpowers him. By the end of the song, her voice has completely taken over, only a distortion interferes with her message. The song itself is a broadcast, an attempt to connect, but there's no confirmation that the message was received. 

Continuing with the theme of the album is the closing song, "Reservations." Here, the singer proclaims to his partner that he has so many reservations but none of them are "about you." Over and over, the singer repeats the same words, and then the noise continues, as though it has drowned him, and the effect leaves us uneasy, which of course is the purpose of the album and the nature of miscommunication.

Headline: Bowie plays new role with "Heathen"
Author: Alfred Soto
&nbsp;
For almost two decades David Bowie has played "David Bowie," one of rock's registered trademarks, a guarantee of aloof, unimpeachable cool – even when the albums he assembles can barely conceal his own indifference.

And, let's face it, Bowie's been dull (or just awful) for too long. Critics often lament how in the '80s Bowie lost the shape-shifting gift from which sprang Hunky Dory, Station To Station, Low and other benchmarks of his endlessly listenable '70s catalogue, but that's not quite accurate. In fact, the Thin White Duke has spent the last 10 years playing a role, albeit an poorly conceived one: The Wealthy Dilettante, the witty elder statesman with capped teeth and hot model wife who sells himself to the latest trends for the right price or a spot in a V.I.P. room next to P. Diddy.

That said, Heathen is the best album we can expect from Bowie at this point in his career. If I'm damning him with faint praise, keep in mind that the only option open to a poseur with avant-garde credentials, who has long since anesthetized his angst with money, is to cannibalize his past. 

And it makes perfect sense: The ch-ch-changeling, after years of recasting glam, disco, Kraut-rock and synth-pop in his own image, turns in on himself at middle age.

What's surprising about Heathen is how moving Bowie makes his self-homage. Reuniting with Tony Visconti, producer of nearly every one of his albums from Young Americans to Scary Monsters, makes for great publicity (and hence sales). 

What better way to hook disillusioned older fans? But Visconti's studio mastery complements Bowie's strongest melodies in years by re-emphasizing his songs' synthetic qualities. 

At his best, Bowie is the consummate actor, his laboriously constructed songs – the off-kilter keyboards, solid rhythm section, sonic knick-knacks, that famous baritone – gloriously mannered performances.

The best Heathen songs evoke Bowie's golden years. Visconti's control allows Bowie to rely on pals like Dave Grohl and Carlos Alomar to augment his own underrated instrumental skills. 

For example, he uses Stylaphone – the primitive synthesizer that lent "Space Oddity" its otherworldly air – on "Slip Away" as the best kind of musical wink, and when he sings, "Here in space it's always 1982," he's Major Tom again, reliving the beautiful moment before Let's Dance turned his spaceman shtick into serious moonlight.

Bowie at his iciest is a lot of fun (as on Station To Station), but a Bowie who takes his melodrama seriously is a fool. Although most of the songs that portend a gloomy future ("Sunday," "5:15 The Angels Have Gone") fade in a whiz of atmospherics, "Slowburn" (with cock-crazy Pete Townsend's lead guitar), is just that – all controlled, surly menace. And "A Better Future" is something more: a genuinely touching sequel of sorts to "Kooks," a song he wrote in 1971 for his son. 

Wrapping his gentlest croon around brisk acoustic guitar, Bowie sings: "I demand a better future/ Or I might just stop wanting you" not only as if he meant it, but as if he knew the future was still his to enjoy.

Only it isn't. When you're a commodity like Bowie (and with a fortune estimated at a quarter of a billion dollars, these days he's rarely anything more than that) what matters to investors is how Bowiesque a new album sounds rather than how much it challenges the efficacy of the Bowie image. 

Heathen never challenges; in certain places it gets downright defensive. Unlike Neil Young, he can't simply pick up a guitar and write a song about his feelings. He's never been a human being, just a highbrow Dorian Grey who once showed an amazing talent for image manipulation.

Heathen proves that Bowie at 55 knows as much as Bowie at 25: He's still his own best songwriting subject, and an old narcissist is still a narcissist; in Bowie's case, that's the most entertaining kind.
