On offense, The Golden Panthers continue to struggle in the redzone, although they have shown improvement. Then again, it was against I-AA FAMU, whose defense is nowhere near as tough as that of 2004 Sun Belt Conference Champion North Texas. Also, Ben West will need a repeat performance of Oct. 1.

On Defense, FIU will need to do the obvious and stop the two-headed monster rushing attack of Patrick Cobbs and Jamario Thomas - the 2003 and 2004 National Rushing Champions, respectively. The duo has rushed for a combined 112.3 yard per game in 2005 and FIU's defense has allowed 178.2 yards per game

Headline: Women's soccer drops two straight
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's soccer team is still struggling to produce offensively. Janet Liguori was the only Golden Panther to score in a 2-1 loss to the University of Denver on Oct. 7. FIU was then shutout in a 1-0 defeat to the University of North Texas Oct. 9. The back-to-back losses leave the team with a record of 3-5-4 (1-2-1 Sun Belt). FIU looks to rebound against Middle Tennessee Oct. 14. 


Denver 2, FIU 1


The University of Denver established itself as a premiere force in the Sun Belt Conference by defeating FIU 2-1. Goals by Taryn Hemmings and Rachael Fry gave the visiting team a victory at FIU Soccer Stadium and placed the Pioneers on top of the Sun Belt standings. 

Denver (6-5-2, 3-0-1) opportunistically struck in the eighth minute. Taryn Hemmings seized a goal kick by FIU goalkeeper Madeline Gannon and then overpowered defender Kristin Hurst. Gannon challenged Hemmings, but could not stop the charging forward's shot from bouncing into the bottom right corner of the goal. 

"It was a poor goal kick and our defender wasn't ready," FIU head coach Everton Edwards said about the score. "We gave up a foolish goal."

FIU was stunned once again when Rachael Fry scored in the 65th minute. Fry knifed through the defense to get within six yards of the goal and guided a cross from Dana Schonberger straight into the net. 

The FIU crowd finally had a reason to cheer when Janet Liguori scored for the fourth time this season. Liguori danced through two defenders to create space for a shot from 30 yards out, which was blasted into the top right corner of the net. 

Denver held onto the lead after Liguori's 78th minute goal, which frustrated Edwards.

"We've missed about 10 chances in the first few minutes [of each game]," Edwards declared. "[The players] want to dribble and be fancy. They don't do the things that make the game simple."


North Texas 1, FIU 0 


FIU must be experiencing déjà vu. The Golden Panthers were shutout for the seventh time of the season in a 1-0 loss to the University of North Texas. The match was the first played between the two teams since the 2004 Sun Belt Conference Championship game, which the Mean Green also won 1-0.

North Texas (9-2-2, 4-0) secured the win when Heather Hutyra scored in the 61st minute. Hutyra, who was five yards away from the nearest FIU player, was able to easily head a cross from Jamie Yates into the net for a 1-0 lead.

Edwards was disappointed by the blunder and gave a play-by-play recap of why North Texas was able to score.

"Our forward made a mistake and didn't chase back. The midfielder didn't make a tackle and the ball went up. Our players thought the ball was going out and stopped, but North Texas kept going and was able to cross it in for the score." 

FIU almost equalized in the 63rd minute when Tamara Kochen received a pass from Liguori. Kochen battled a North Texas defender and was able to fire a powerful shot, but it sailed wide of the right goal post.  

The final 1-0 result has made  Edwards question whether or not the team will recover from its recent skid.

"The team's not showing me anything that would make me think we're going to do well in the conference because we have no intensity," Edwards said. "That's something that I can't teach; it comes from within."

Subheadline: Men's soccer gets payback with shutout over Golden Knights
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team met Central Florida Oct. 8 with more than bragging rights and a Conference USA victory at stake.

With vengeance on the line, the Golden Panthers routed the Golden Knights 3-0 in front of 511 rabid fans, erasing the memory of a crushing defeat to UCF in the 2004 NCAA tournament.

"We all had revenge in our minds," said forward/midfielder Jean Camere. 

Defender Ainsley Deer added: "It was a personal vendetta for all of us collectively and we went out there and did it. We made it happen."

The win raises FIU's record to 6-3-1 overall and 2-0-1 in C-USA, elevating the Golden Panthers to second place in the conference. FIU has scored 11 unanswered goals over the past three games as both the offense and defense have thrived. 

Ranked sixth in the country in assists per game, senior Lucas Scudeler set the tone for FIU in the 16th minute. Scudeler possessed the ball at the top of the box, pausing in front of a defender until he saw Jared Rose slashing to his left. He passed the ball in stride and Rose scored with his left foot, shooting the ball past McIntosh into the right corner of the net.

"[Lucas] had the guy held off pretty well so I saw him holding it," said Rose, a co-captain. "I made a run, he found me and it was a great ball by him. I credit him with all the praise."

Central Florida midfielder Billy Judino pressured the FIU defense all night with lengthy throw-ins that entered the FIU box. Goalkeeper Shawn Crowe was up to the task however, intercepting three of the tosses in a crowd.

"Their main weapons were the long throw-in and so forth and we handled that really well," said head coach Karl Kremser. "Shawn did a good job up in the air."

Crowe was not the only Golden Panther showing off his hops. Co-captain Paul Kolovos made two nice headers over the top of UCF midfielder Islam Rashwan to keep possession in FIU's favor at key moments in the game.

The Golden Panthers' effort paid off in the 50th minute when reserve Jean Camere stopped a loose ball cold, baiting a defender overboard. Camere then found junior David Hope open on the two-on-one and Hope shot past McIntosh to give FIU a 2-0 lead.

"I kind of saw the play right before I did it," Camere said. "It was one of those spoons where you bring it back and you go the other direction. I saw David making a great run, slipped it by and he finished it well."

Hope, who has excelled as a starter over the past four games, concurred that Camere made a spectacular play.

"Jean's a top player; I knew he's got that ball in him," said Hope. "I just made the run and hoped he'd pass the ball. He pretty much put on the play for me."

Like Camere, freshman Judah Hernandez shined against UCF after sitting out FIU's first two conference games last weekend. 

Drawing McIntosh out of the box in the 89th minute, Hernandez passed off to sophomore Danny Vazquez, who scored his fourth goal of the season with a laser off the right foot. It was the first assist of Hernandez's career.

"It was a 1-2 and he made a real nice run to it, so it was easy to play the ball to him," said Hernandez, who thrilled fans moments later by faking out UCF midfielder Mark Wong. "I'm glad he finished it; it was a better finish than a pass."

Crowe made a diving save on a shot by UCF midfielder Derron Cornwall at 88:42 to ensure his second straight shutout and third overall this season. 

The Caribbean defensive trio of Ainsley Deer, Sheldon Jardine and Pierre HóSang, aided Crowe's effort by kicking away balls when they got deep into the FIU box. The defensive chemistry is natural for the three long-time friends. 

"We're all from the Caribbean and our style of play is to be calm and easy and collected," said Deer, who fronted Jon Imran and Bryan Haisley to prevent shots late in the second half. "Sheldon and I go way back. I used to play with him in junior college and we always had that bond. Pierre and I used to go to the same high school so we have that same spirit."

The selfless play of FIU was epitomized in Crowe's words for his defenders after the game. 

"It was more them who got the shutout than me," Crow said. "I really congratulate them for playing great. We all played great as a team."

On the road, FIU now heads toward two important C-USA matches with Tulsa Oct. 14 and conference leader Southern Methodist Oct. 16. For SMU-transfer Danny Vazquez, the trip to Dallas is a much anticipated one.

"I've been waiting for this," Vazquez said. "I just hope I score. That's all I want to do, score in front of all those people."

FIU has lost to SMU three straight years, something senior Jared Rose hopes to change.

"In my time here, I've never beaten SMU, so that's a big time game for me," Rose said. "We really want to go out there and do as well as we can."

There's nothing like a little vengeance to motivate a team.

Headline: DeLay indicted on conspiracy charges
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Tom DeLay finally got what he deserved. The former House majority leader was indicted by a Texas federal grand jury last week on charges that he funneled illegal corporate donations to state legislative candidates through a political action committee he created, Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC). 

The money ($1,217,916)  was used to enact DeLay's successful but unusual scheme of redrawing Texas' congressional districts in 2002, which resulted in Republicans gaining four additional seats in the 2004 election.

Although all Americans are innocent until proven guilty before the law, DeLay's claims that the charges are an "abomination to justice," stemming from a political grudge held against him by Travis County prosecutor Ronnie Earle, are nothing but obnoxious and unfounded. 

Earle, a registered Democrat, has in fact indicted more Democrats than Republicans. He even indicted himself on a misdemeanor charge for failing to properly file campaign finance reports. His record as a touch prosecutor, bent on nabbing corrupt politicians, speaks for itself. DeLay's actions and suspicious behavior drew the attention of law enforcement officials, as did the four admonishments by the House Ethics Committee.

To get a sense of who DeLay is as a man and as an elected official, one just needs to look at some of his heartfelt words. He calls the Environmental Protection Agency "the Gestapo of government" and favors repealing the Clean Air Act because "it's never been proven that air toxins are hazardous to people." If DeLay had his druthers we'd probably all have to wear gas masks when we opened our front doors. He also rejects the separation of church and state concept and feels that judges ruling against the conservative agenda "need to be intimidated." 

Apparently, DeLay supports a Christian theocracy that disregards minority rights. Finally, he denies that there are Americans trying to raise a family on minimum wage - fortunately such families do not exist. And he claims Democrats are out of touch with reality? 

Clearly DeLay is an ideologically extreme and quite dangerous politician. While there have been many others like him, none has ever held the power he did.

Fortunately, House rules dictate that the majority leader must step down if under indictment. Hence, DeLay is out and Missouri Republican Roy Blunt has replaced him on a temporary basis. Will the House continue to pass dangerous legislation under Blunt's leadership? That's hard to project, but what is quite telling is the Republican reaction to DeLay's ouster.

"Leadership has become ossified and hopelessly out of touch," claimed one anonymous House Republican as quoted in Newsweek. "They only care about one thing, hanging onto their own power." 

This sentiment is shared by many conservatives who still refuse to identify themselves out of fear of retribution should DeLay regain his former position. Even President George  Bush has been lukewarm in support of his fellow right-wing conservative, calling DeLay "effective" and a "good ally."

The Republican party is now feeling the consequences of its illegal and unethical power grabs of the last 10 years. The suspicions go beyond DeLay. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is under investigation by the Security and Exchange Committee for his sale of HCA stock days before the company released damaging financial data. Frist's brother is a higher end administrator on the HCA board. Though the stock was in a "blind" trust, the fact that Frist personally participated in the sale of the stock has raised legitimate questions. Did Frist receive illegal information that led to his dropping of the stock as Martha Stewart was convicted of doing? These questions definitely need answering.

Still unresolved is the White House's role in the outing of CIA undercover operative Valerie Plame. With special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald having just secured the testimony of newly freed journalist Judith Miller, his findings are due for release any day now. 

With allegations pointed at "Bush's Brain", Karl Rove and Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Bush and the entire Republican  party may have much deeper problems to handle. 

The disaster in Iraq, delayed reaction to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and ridicule from the left and right on the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court are all also playing factors in shaping up Bush's second term as among the most cataclysmic in American history.

There is only one way to eliminate these nefarious individuals and the ideology they represent. Stamp them out of office, starting in 2006. Democrats, though not immune to scandals themselves, still hold the moral higher ground at this point. 

They can point and ask Americans, "Do you want these reprehensible officials representing you?" 

However, a vision for America and policies to address the concerns of average Americans are essential. Let's hope the Democratic Party learned its lesson in 2004. This is a golden opportunity for them and us as Americans.

Headline: The Miracle drug:
Subheadline: A race against time
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Teenagers getting pregnant, AIDS epidemic spreading uncontrollably, new types of cancers being discovered daily. Scary thoughts? Yes. Unfortunately, they're reality. 

Scientists work hastily to defeat the plights we have yet to overcome: Cancer AIDS, Alzheimer's and Diabetes. But what about the issues we can combat?

The Food and Drug Administration was supposed to release Plan B, an emergency oral contraceptive, known as "the morning after pill," over-the-counter in early 2005. 

A unanimous 28-0 vote in December 2004 confirmed the safety of the drug. So, why is it still not readily available? After all, the FDA's duty is to determine medical safety, not to ponder morality.

If a cure for AIDS were unveiled tomorrow, would people be more supportive of releasing it because AIDS is a major problem, or would people be more reluctant because many AIDS patients contract the disease by means which they feel are unacceptable to them? 

Our world must stop judging in terms of if and begin judging in terms of is. Teenage pregnancy is a problem. 

Though larger issues, such as responsibility, envelop the crisis, ignoring it won't encourage improvement. And denying means of prevention will certainly make it worse. 

Drugs are dangerous whether legal or illegal. But legal means of birth control promote safety. 

Those who advocate discontinuing Plan B don't realize their crusade won't discontinue sex. And what about rape? Those who oppose Plan B, which can prevent the trauma of abortion, make the lives of victims dreadfully complicated. Don't like Plan B? Then perhaps you prefer Plan C: Coat hangers.

A.Y. Siu, author of the article "Why I'm a Pro-Choice Christian," is an excellent example for religious activists to follow. Siu may not approve of abortion or birth control, but he respects the decision is not his to make. 

"Women, of course, will disagree with each other, but a woman's body is a woman's body. I do not think men should have the right to legislate women's bodies," Siu said.

Plan B shouldn't be the type of birth control an individual relies upon habitually, but accidents happen and statistics prove the drug would prevent enormous amounts of error. 

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimated that making emergency contraception available over-the-counter could prevent about two million pregnancies annually (half of about all unintended pregnancies in the United States) and 500,000 abortions. 

If sexual mistakes are bound to happen, would one rather advocate preventive measures or allow 500,000 unnecessary abortions to occur? 

Those who choose the latter have serious issues that need to be addressed.

Pro-life refers to opposition to abortion, not necessarily opposition to birth control. Contrary to popular assumption, Plan B cannot cause an abortion. 

An FDA statement listing common questions and answers about Plan B stated progestin (a major component) works by preventing the release of an egg from an ovary and/or union of sperm and egg (fertilization). However, if a fertilized egg is implanted prior to taking Plan B, the drug will not prevent pregnancy. 

Many egocentric individuals won't budge when it comes to the reality that preventative resources are available. David Hager, conservative evangelical Christian doctor, is among these individuals. He crafted a "minority report," outlining why over-the-counter sales should be rejected. 

According to The Washington Post, Hager told the group that he didn't write his report from an "evangelical Christian perspective," but from a scientific one, arguing that the panel had too little information on how easier access to Plan B would affect girls younger than 16. 

Meanwhile, safety for women of any age has been verified.

"I argued from a scientific perspective, and God took that information and he used it through this minority report to influence the decision," Hager said. "Once again, what Satan meant for evil, God turned into good." Either Hager is brain-dead or on drugs. 

Brainwashing and scare-tactics advocating abortion or opposing birth control usually involve grotesque images of aborted fetuses or convictions that Jesus would have condemned. 

Even as a pro-choice supporter, aborted fetus pictures fail to elate me. And even as a Jew, I admit Jesus probably didn't agree with the concept of birth control or abortion. 

Yet, Jesus is known to have preached love and healing, not the meticulous practice of admonishing others. 

How ironic it is that alleged followers of Jesus advocating pro-life focus more on supposed faults of others (homosexuality, abortion, pre-martial sex) than on creating a world full of love and humanity.

"There's never been an adverse medical event in any age group using Plan B," said Vivian Dickinson, past president of the ACOG in The Washington Post. 

Though emotional vulnerability is arguable, once a female begins her menstrual cycle, her body is ready to reproduce. Therefore, it's safe for her to use emergency contraception as the FDA established. 

But as long as the Plan B hype goes on, maybe it should reconsider making cigarettes and alcohol illegal. 

While they're at it, why not ban the pill or condoms? While the Pope might back them, Catholic priests might advise differently.

Nursing Dean Appointed Chair of National  Health Disparities Task Force

FIU's School of Nursing Dean Divina Grossman has been appointed Chair of the 18-member American Academy of Nursing Health Disparities Task Force.

Grossman and a group of nursing faculty members and consultants have developed cultural awareness programs for health care providers and administrators in eight Florida counties affiliated with Health Choice Networks during the past three years. 

The idea of developing culturally aware health care providers led FIU to include this kind of training in the curriculum. University officials have also included cultural awareness training in the curriculum of the proposed new medical school, which would be Miami-Dade's first public medical school if approved.

Rain and hail diverts aid from earthquake stricken areas

Heavy rain and hail diverted U.S. helicopters and airplanes loaded with food and medicine away from earthquake-stricken regions Oct. 11, 78 hours after Saturday's quake in Pakistan. 

According to the associated Press, the death toll would surpass 35,000 people.

U.S. military helicopters helped the wounded out of the wrecked city of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-ruled Kashmir. 

International aid teams of Germans, Turks and the British used high-tech cameras to scan under piles of concrete, steel and wood.

Thousands of civilian volunteers, some carrying picks and shovels on their shoulders, also walked north toward quake-hit towns.

Much like in New Orleans, loitering has also become a problem. 

Over 200 people raided a stock of food arranged by relief workers at a soccer field near Muzaffarabad's center - one of six designated aid distribution points. 

Bob McKerrow, coordinator of relief efforts for the International Federation of the Red Cross, told CNN that one can still have hope for survivors trapped for five to seven days, although he cautioned that the cold and wet weather would also become a factor.

Headline: Women's studies expands program
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Women's studies is not just for women nor is it the study of men bashing.  

"Contrary to what some people might think, we not only have women in the program, we are open to anyone [who] is interested in exploring equality and power relations from a gender perspective," said Aurora Morcillo, associate director of the Women's Studies Center and professor of women's studies and history.

Over the past five years, the program has increased noticeably. 

"We've had tremendous growth; five years ago, we had about 20 students in the major, [as opposed to this year] there are 90 students in the major and 115 certificates," said Suzanna Rose, director of the Women's Studies Center and professor of psychology.    

According to Rose, the number of male students has increased by approximately 25 percent.

"I would recommend it to other men, even though women's studies is a politically controversial field. It is worth while to recognize and understand the diverse perspectives of human interaction offered by women's studies," said Ian Morris, graduate certificate-seeking student. 

The program offers a bachelor's degree in women's studies and an undergraduate certificate program. 

Recently, a graduate certificate and an online certificate have been added to the program. 

"The certificate is only six classes, the bachelors is 10 and you must have completed 60 credits of lower division classes," Morcillo said.

Women's studies is interdisciplinary and many students are taking advantage of this.

"I'm so passionate about the program and hopefully I'll be able to help people understand what an asset getting a bachelors or certificate in women's studies is for any career," said junior Ivanessa Arostedui, treasurer for the Women's Studies Student Association (WSSA).  

WSSA holds activities throughout the year, such as leadership seminars and community service projects. This July they attended "Young Activist Training" in order to learn how to become active in politics.

There are various internships available to students in the program that help them work in the community and open doors in the labor market. 

Internships in museums, government organizations, business and law offices are offered to students in the program.

"Other than academic activities, we have a close interest in working with the community and making our students able to be competitive in the labor market. So when [students] get a degree in women's studies, they have a special interest to add to their degree. If you do law, you can deal with family law, immigration law and see how women are effected [or] work in business and get jobs in human resources [where] your knowledge in women's studies can help you with issues of sexual harassment and equal opportunity pay," Morcillo said. 

Innovations in the program include a masters program that is in development, as well as an exchange program at the University of Granada in Spain with the intention to expand into other Latin American countries. 

"We want to get an applied masters for students that graduate from [FIU] and we want the master's program to have an international component," Morcillo said.

Getting a master's program approved by the University Curriculum Committee and university faculty can be a long technical process.

"I hope it will be approved by next fall if all goes well. I am working on the approval right now," Rose said.

Students are excited about the possible master's program and how their hard work will be reflected upon the rest of the university.

"The master's program will be really beneficial [in that it] will show the way we are determined to pursue academic excellence," said Megan Kelley, senior and president of WSSA.

This year, the Women's Studies Center is celebrating its 25th year anniversary with the "Women of Distinction" Lecture series, a student conference in which students present a magazine publication  called Making Waves. 

This year, Volume 3, which included poetry and essays, was released. 

To finish the celebration, a gala fundraiser is scheduled for April 2006 in which women in the community will be able to make a donation toward the program.

Headline: Alumni  give back to FIU through mentorships
Author: Luis Cabrera  / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Cozy couches and the smell of meatballs greeted mentors and students as they entered the University Park Faculty Club for The Women's Center's "Meet and Greet" event. The rainy sky did not deter students who were eager to meet their new mentors for the Fall semester. The event, which was rescheduled for Oct. 4, due to Hurricane Rita had been an entire summer in the making.

 The mentoring program, which began in 1989, matches female students with a mentor in an area specific to their field of study.  The mentors and students develop professional and personal relationships, in which mentors help students become involved and synchronized in their specific field. 

Suzanne Oronato, director for the Women's Center mentor program, led a discussion focusing on the program's past, history and hopeful future.

"This program gives us the opportunity to match 30 young female students with a faculty member, staff member or alumni. This is the biggest year for the program. In total, there are 87 students involved between the UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus," said Oronato.

 Oronato has been working with the Women's Center since January 2005. She organized a mentoring program last spring, which involved less than 20 students. Determined to involve more participants in the program, Oronato began to explore different ways to draw students in.

 "This summer, I worked with program directors to find programs more prevalent for women," Oronato said. "I tried to involve the assistant dean of the nursing program, the education program and the Honors College. I think it has served us well."

FIU alumna and mentor Carmen Pichardo majored in psychology and criminal justice and was paired with a student who is doing the same.

 "They [the mentoring program] e-mailed me and asked if I wanted to participate," said Pichardo. "I am an [alumna] and now work in law enforcement. I'm really excited to see who is interested in law enforcement."  

The mentor program supports a professional relationship as well as an emotional one, in which students may learn from mentors and vice-versa. 

"We've entered this program intentionally," said Oronato during her presentation. "We've seen some of the value that comes out of a mentoring program, some of the good things that come from tender love and care and that's why we're here tonight."

Goals are set for the program and dates are scheduled a student and mentor to meet.  

The program follows several guidelines in order to help the relationship grow. 

Yisell Cirion and Vicky Owles, mentor and assistant director for campus life, have been paired as student and mentor for the past two semesters.

"I have gotten out of this a friendship," said  Owles. "I know I can be a resource to her, but I think I inspire her to be something bigger than herself. I'm her biggest cheerleader.  We did 'Take Back the Night' together and other Women's Center programs; we both have a connection through the Women's Center and see each other whenever we can."

Owles also shares with her student the stress of classes and homework because she has recently begun working on her master's degree.

"One day she passed by the office and was complaining she had to write a 30-page paper. So we share our school stress," said Cirion, who is majoring in psychology and women's studies.

Dianne Cordova, who is majoring in management, and Bea Fernandez, a mentor and program advisor, were paired as mentor and student for the first time this semester.

"I got involved because as a student, I had mentors who gave to me and I love FIU [so] I wanted to give back to a [student] the same way," Fernandez said. 

Cordova has participated as a student in a mentoring program before and has returned this second time, choosing the Women's Center. 

"The other program I did was through the Student Alumni Association and I was paired with an entrepreneur. I still keep in touch with him, but I thought I might connect better with a woman.  I'm looking forward to the new perspective."

Fernandez and Cordova agreed that as a commuter school, FIU is a difficult place to meet and connect with people. 

"Anything you can do to get involved," said Fernandez, "You get so much more out of the college experience. You have to make it your own."

Headline: Festival helps raise scholarship money
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The School of Hospitaity and Tourism Management, and Angostura Ltd., an international distributor known for its premium quality rums and mixes, have once again joined forces to raise scholarship funds for international students. 

About 3,000 people came together Oct. 8 to celebrate the fifth Annual University Fete, a carnival-style party which highlights Caribbean culture and raises money for the Angostura Scholarship Fund. 

The festival was held at a patio outside of the Biscayne Bay Campus' Hospitality and Tourism Management building.

Among the crowd were students, faculty, Angostura representatives and visitors from the community and other parts of the world.

Angostura Ltd. provided specialty drinks and exquisite Caribbean and international dishes. 

"What we have here today is Chinese cuisine, Indian food and Jamaican food for the people who are here," said Brenda De La Rosa, Angostura's bar manager. 

Kiosks displayed foods from various Caribbean countries as well as Angostura's extensive selection of products which included its distinctive beverages and sauces. 

"We are a shipping company to the Caribbean and because this is a Caribbean event, we get involved in it every year," said Brian Edun, a representative for Laparkan, a sea and air cargo company that ships to Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana and Haiti among other countries.

Frank Dillon, coordinator  for Angostura, said that about 90 percent of students who volunteered were from the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management. 

"It gives students from the School of Hospitality and [Tourism] Management an opportunity to get first hand experience on what it takes to put on a large event in terms of the food, organizing and how to handle people," Dillon said. 	

Jessica James, a senior from the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, said it was her first time volunteering for the event. 

"I was in the bar managing the beer," James said. "A lot of students volunteered and gave their time because it comes back in the end." 

The rhythmic sounds of Caribbean music had attendees dancing throughout the carnival. 

"Visitors came and having a lot of fun," said Saauda Hosein who attended last year and was working the carnival for the first time this year.

The proceeds of the event will be allocated for students in the form of the Angostura scholarship fund. 

"Whatever funds that are generated from this event will be given to the School of Hospitality [and Tourism Management] for the Angostura Scholarship Fund," Dillon said. 

In turn, the funds will help benefit international students.

Headline: Movie fails to capture magic of series
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
No show in the history of television has ever taken the term "cult classic" as far as Fox's "Family Guy," which premiered in 1999 with high ratings, but was inexplicably cancelled three years later. It made a strong comeback this spring thanks to the support of a tremendous fan base.

However, it now seems as if Seth MacFarlane, the show's creator, is trying too hard to capitalize on the  comedy's success, first with his sad unfunny animated follow-up "American Dad" (also Sunday nights on Fox) and now with the movie "Family Guy Presents: Stewie Griffin - The Untold Story," a DVD feature recently released.

The film follows three different adventures of America's favorite Rhode Island family, the Griffins. The first segment deals with football-headed baby Stewie Griffin's plans to reform his evil ways after a near-death experience. 

The second shows family patriarch, Peter, working as an opinionated reporter for Quahog's news station, with the final third of the movie returning to Stewie and his quest to find a similarly football-headed man he thinks may be his real father.

MacFarlane states in the DVD's commentary track that he had been planning a "Family Guy" movie ever since the show's cancellation. This fact doesn't seem too obvious in the film itself, since the 88-minute epic can be viewed more like an extended episode of the show rather than an actual movie.

Despite the fact that the plots are loosely-connected, the film is also hurt by its many poor attempts at comedy - trying to mimic the fast-paced, culturally relevant and always random jokes that made the show such a hit.

Jabs at Ghandi, "Star Trek," Roseanne and other modern icons, ran for too long, often soliciting either polite chuckles from the audience or moments of awkward silence.

This lack of comedic timing came as a big surprise, especially since the already risque "Family Guy" franchise advertised this endeavor as "All-new, outrageous, and uncensored." However, the only jokes that seemed to fit the bill were in a scene with young Condoleeza Rice locking lips with a female roommate and a depiction of a talking scrotum. 

Everything else was either overdone or a rehash of jokes formerly used in the TV show.

The best highlight of the DVD was a mockumentary, presented as an introduction and conclusion to the movie, chronicling what the Griffins had been up to during the years after the show's cancellation. 

Faithful fans can also appreciate cameos from the many quirky characters introduced during the first three seasons, including sexaholic Glen Quagmire, Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa, the greasy deaf-mute and many more.

Though the movie overall failed to grasp the subtle and subversive charm of the original, fans can at least rejoice that re-runs on Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim" and the weekly episodes on Fox will keep the show, that made jokes out of pedophilia and cripples, running for a long time.

Headline: Diaz and Collette join forces
Author: Danny Carratala / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
What would have normally been a good old-fashioned chick flick along the lines of "Steel Magnolias" or "Hope Floats," is anything but, in this coming-of-age story. 

The film is directed by Curtis Hanson, known for his work in the Oscar nominated "L.A. Confidential" and recently for his work in "8 Mile." 

The script comes courtesy of Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich") and is an adaptation of a novel by Jennifer Weiner. 

The movie starts off with Maggie Feller, played by Cameron Diaz, at her 10 year high school reunion. 

Every few seconds, the picture changes to focus on her sister Rose Feller, played by Toni Collette, who is getting ready for work. 

It is noted quickly that these two siblings are different in many ways. 

Maggie is a sexy young lady in her late 20s who has hopped from job to job over the years and is quickly running out of options. 

Her older sister, Rose, is a prosperous lawyer who is constantly taking Maggie under her wing so she can bounce back to the real world. 

Although this is practically a ritual these two women share, Maggie does something awful that she has never done in the past, and her sister is left brokenhearted. 

The dynamic between the two sisters changes throughout the film and keeps the audience guessing what will happen next. 

From start to finish, the audience loathes Diaz's character, a sex addict who does what she can with men simply because she can. Throughout the movie, the audience is intrigued because it's hard to think what Maggie will do next. 

At first, she appears to be rough and rugged and living without a care in the world. 

We witness just how bad she is when she and her sister look back at her previous jobs and why she lost them. 

It is also discovered that aside from her sex addiction, she also has done other bad things in her time. We want to root for her, but at times she makes it impossible for the audience to love her. The self-proclaimed party girl is slowly realizing that the party is over. 

Audiences became fascinated by Maggie for different reasons, such as the growth and change she endures. With former films such as "There's Something About Mary" and both installments of "Charlie's Angels" under her belt, this is a role Diaz has never performed. 

However, she proves herself once again by showing the audience how different she can be by taking on a role that is contrary to anything else she has ever done. So many actors have a hard time breaking out of the mold.

As for Toni Collette, who has helmed such films as "The Sixth Sense" and last years flop "Connie and Carla," she undergoes a drastic change. 

These two actresses both took a risk with this film and it paid off remarkably. A well scripted film, along with great direction and superb acting definitely makes "In her Shoes" a perfect fit.

Headline: Team Sleep's lackluster lyrics sedate record buyers
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It might make good background music for a rainy day, but Team Sleep's debut album, will do just what the name says - put you to sleep. 

Pieced together by Chino Moreno (of the Deftones) and a few of his friends, who included Tom Wilkinson on guitar and Rob Crow singing on four of the 15 tracks, the album feels more like a cut-and-paste project than an effort to work together and synchronize.

The two that do seem to collaborate, for the better of the album, are Zach Hill on drums and Rick Verret on bass. They create more ambiance than all of lead singer's efforts combined. 

They use quick beats on some songs, giving them an upbeat feel and slow beats on others that produce mood pieces worth listening to. The cooperation of the drum and bass carries the album. 

Unfortunately, the other players on Team Sleep are not willing to follow the lead. The music - which sounds more like a stream of consciousness than a song - is heavy on drums and light on guitar. 

The acoustic sound of Wilkinson feels out of place alongside the stiff drums and loud bass. 

Wilkinson's guitar is perhaps Team Sleep's best asset, but it is hardly used to its full potential and gets lost in the heavy electric undercurrents of the music. 

Church bells, radio voices, seagulls and ocean waves cast a confusing light on what might otherwise be good tracks.

The lyrics are overly poetic and sappy, "You made the desk look so new," "I'm yours tonight, so come on" and "it comes, it comes attacking your town." Maybe they are meant to be metaphorical, but they just seem overdone. 

None of them are easily intelligible and most of them are pretty hard to relate to because they are so random and incoherent, as if they're in a dimly lit poetry club waiting for the clicking of fingers.

 These are not lyrics to sing along to, or even remember. They will be lucky if it amounts to background music on reality television.

Two of the album's fifteen tracks aim for higher ground, and succeed. "Tomb of Liege" and "Elizabeth" become the cornerstones that have probably led some critics to call this album "magnificent." 

They are really the only songs that manage to use the talents of all artists involved with flowing, beautiful composition. 

The guitar, bass and drums here, along with the lyrics, manage to be more than the wailing and noise of the other tracks. 

Team Sleep is on the verge of creating a new genre with these two tracks, but unfortunately miss with the other thirteen.

Perhaps Team Sleep has been so highly acclaimed because of the status of the artists behind it. Their effort is noteworthy, but doesn't get the job done. 

They have come together to create an album that is little more than a puzzle, with no bigger picture. 

This album was shelved after industry insiders discovered it existed, and left unfinished for three years. 

The industry and Team Sleep artists seem to be cashing in on their famous names, without putting in the necessary work. 

It might have been better off on the shelf, where it couldn't put listeners straight to sleep.

Headline: BUST a MOVE
Subheadline: Break dancers shatter the norm with remarkable agility
Author: Danny Carratala / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Almost every weeknight in the Graham Center pit, a group of break dancers take over. What would normally be a mundane, uneventful weeknight on campus, transforms into something that's anything but ordinary. Before passing by the GC pit, one could already hear the music - experimental funk with a progressive drum break and a relatively up-tempo beat. 

Slowly but surely, as soon as "Salsa Kings" wraps up their practice nearby, more and more dancers start to show up in the pit. Half an hour later, about eleven break dancers in total can be seen practicing their moves. 

At this point, it was getting busy. Not a second passed where the makeshift dance floor was unoccupied. Franco "Metaflux" Canepa, an 18-year-old from Miami Dade College, was, by far, the most talkative member of the group. 

"I've been dancing for roughly six years," he said. "It's really time consuming."

Canepa also made it known that his crew members take their show on the road. They have been to break exhibitions and competitions in California, New York, Georgia and all over Florida. One lucky group member is even going to Asia in two weeks for a long-awaited break exhibition. 

"We intend to keep traveling," Canepa said. "The key is to travel and to see where the talent takes you."

Junior "Demos," said to be the spiritual one of the group, enjoys his spotlight on the dance floor. His robotic arm movements, along with his smooth steps, definitely get him noticed. 

As the dancers continue their practice, people no longer rushed through GC to get to their destination; they actually began to slow down a bit and take a peek. Many even stopped in their tracks to admire the group. 

There was a young man who was one of the first to arrive and one of the last to leave, the self-anointed leader of the pack, perhaps. 

He was in the pit giving some pointers to a fellow dancer, sophomore Mario Toledo, and performing some gravity defying moves as well. His name was Deimos Delnodal, a.k.a. "Indelible," a 27-year-old student from Miami Dade College. 

Delnodal enjoys to break it down.

"It makes me feel good, you know, the physicality part I like," he said.

According to Delnodal, he has been dancing for a decade - a good part of his adult life.

A few more members arrived and began stretching as if preparing for ballet - obviously they take what they do very seriously. Charlotte Schultz, the only female of the group, lied down on the floor and began stretching. Schultz is a 21-year-old freshman from North Carolina. 

"I break dance for fun, for exercise, releasing energy and aggression," Schultz said.

The dacners bring a sense of passion for what they do and conduct unapologetic dance sessions every night of the week. 

They welcome anyone who passes through the pit to enjoy their show. Even though it is not a classroom, one might surprisingly have a lot to learn.

Headline: On C. Joel Marino's "Movie fails to capture magic of series"
Subheadline:  
Author: emald004@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
In the Oct. 13, 2005 article "Movie fails to capture magic of series" by C. Joel Marino, his report of "American Dad!" all true except that Seth McFarlen "is trying too hard to capitalize on the comedy's (Family Guy) success."   The show is not as funny as Family Guy -- and from what I watch may never compare to Family Guy except for the animation -- but "American Dad!" is not a show that Seth begged Fox to put in a slot.  Remember that inspite "Family Guy's" instant success, almighty Fox cancelled it.  McFarlen's only "capitalization" on "Family Guy's" success was Fox desperity to give McFarlen, pretty much, anything he wanted.  Besides money, what else would an innovative creator and producer want, I guess more titles on his resume. Enter "American Dad!" He may not "seem" like he's not trying with "American Dad!" because, well, maybe he doesn't have to.
