Headline: SG-Council leader discusses  beliefs, duties
Author: Elvis Ramirez / BBC Life Editor
&nbsp;
Cassandra Andrade, Student Government Council vice president for the Biscayne Bay Campus, describes Katiana S. Saintable, SGC-BBC president, as a quirky and bubbly but dedicated leader. They first met during their respective campaigns last Spring and were "instantly in-sync."

They campaigned separately because Andrade ran unopposed.

"[Saintable] leads but she's the type of leader that does things, she doesn't just point fingers [and expect things to be done]," Andrade said.

Some of Saintable's goals as SGC-BBC president are the campus bookstore's addition of the "C-store," a convenience store which would operate beyond the bookstore's business hours; the completion of the "Go Green" initiative to use less paper, install water efficient showerheads, increase the number of recycling bins on campus; and a more accesible council.

Saintable mentioned being aware of several other projects for the campus: the Aquatic Center repairs, which is closed due to structural and other damages; the possible opening of a new entrance to BBC at 135th street; and the addition of a residence hall at BBC to replace the current residence hall, which may be demolished after the new residence hall's completion.

"Our University is developing and growing so quickly, and I didn't want BBC to be left behind," said Saintable, a senior and English major.

She was not involved in student government at North Miami Senior High School, where she graduated from. She said that government and politics were not for her.

She also had no aspirations to become the SGC-BBC president.

After not being hired as a resident assistant, friends suggested that she run for SGC-BBC president because she met all of the qualifications.

Saintable decided to join SGC-BBC when she went to the United States Student Association Legislative Conference in Washington D.C. last fall as a student lobbyist. There, she learned about issues affecting students throughout the nation, such as the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which provides funds for students in need of financial aid.

"Seeing how much power as citizens we have, how much power as students we have when we come together in one voice and shout. It really made me believe one person can make a difference," Saintable said.

Because Saintable realized that students don't know the kind of power that they have, she took it as her responsibility as SGC-BBC president to inspire students to become involved.

"We are making it known to students that they can be on committees on [the Student Government Association] and give input [and] help, without the commitment of holding a position," she said.	"[The idea of] having people not against their government, or oppressed by their government, but a part of their government. That really motivated me to go ahead and be that one to motivate others." BBC Student Organizations Council members, who share the same office area with SGC-BBC, attest to the fact that Saintable is a motivating leader who knows how to perform her duties effectively.

"When she speaks, she commands attention," said Jose "Jay" Flores, former SOC-BBC treasurer. 

Students go to Saintable's office when they have a concern, such as the Golden Panther Express shuttle leaving them behind.

The president works more than the 20 hours required by the position; SGC-BBC meetings alone run longer than their scheduled time, Andrade said.

"The role of the president is more than people see … the job becomes your life," Andrade said.

Saintable, 21, was born and raised in Miami and is of Haitian descent.

Having visited Haiti in July to see relatives, she gained further resolve to educate students as to what they can do with their government to improve their college experience. 

"You don't always have to fight the power. But get the power to do things right," Saintable said.

She plans on pursuing a Master of Arts degree in English after graduation.

Headline: Students' families to experience university life
Author: Jessica Señorin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students' parents and family members will have a chance to experience university life during the third annual Parents and Family Weekend, taking place from Oct. 5 to 7.

Although the Orientation and Commuter Student Services are sponsoring the event, all student organizations and departments have been invited to coordinate their own events to showcase their resources and to give families a chance to learn more about FIU. 

"The purpose of the event is to provide an opportunity for students to show off the campus and all of the amazing things they've been doing during their time as a student at FIU," said Justin Brady, coordinator for Parent Programs with Orientation and Commuter Student Services.

Ivy Siegel, coordinator for the Division of Student Affairs with Campus Life and Orientation, said students and their families "can expect to have a great time, meet some of the FIU staff and experience some of college life."

On Oct. 5, at 6 p.m., there will be a wine and cheese reception with BBC faculty and staff from the Division of Student Affairs at the Hospitality Management building.

"[The Division of Student Affairs] provides a link to all of the services and activities students can participate in to have a holistic student experience, providing them with the 'out-of-classroom' learning and development [that] students can't get solely from [academics]," Brady said.

Sponsored by FIU's Interfraternity Council, the 5K Fun Run/Walk will kick off at 7 a.m. on Oct. 6 at UP. The event is also open to the public.

Proceeds of the run/walk will go to St. Jude Children's Hospital, the first institution established for the purpose of conducting research on catastrophic childhood diseases, mainly cancer.

"It is great to see members of the FIU Greek community pulling together for such an amazing cause. We are hoping that with the support of the FIU community, IFC will be able to donate at least $2,000 to St. Jude," said Sally Gates, coordinator for New Student Programs with Campus Life.

A Tailgate Party will take place at 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 6 outside the Orange Bowl, before the Golden Panthers football team plays against Troy State at 7 p.m.

Intercampus shuttles will be available so that families can attend events on different campuses.

The registration deadline has been extended to Oct. 4.

For more information, call 305-348-6414, or e-mail parent@fiu.edu.

Headline: Review: Halo 3 (Game)
Subheadline: PLAYERS CAN FINALLY 'FINISH THE FIGHT'
Author: Kevin Castro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sept. 25, 2007 marked the day that Halo fans waited more than three years to get their hands on the series' latest installment. When Halo 2 left off, Master Chief, a genetically enhanced super soldier, arrived on Earth as the planet was being decimated by an alien force known as the Covenant. With this sequel, the fate of humanity still rests in Master Chief's hands.

In the game, your objective is to stop the Halo rings, galactic weapons of doom, from activating, thus preventing mass destruction. The Elites, comprised of Covenant officers and commanders, are now on your side as civil war cracks the alien army in half. The single player campaign has improved much since Halo 2. In the campaign, your main enemies are the Brutes, Covenant soldiers who resemble gorillas and hunt with a pack mentality that only a Spartan can survive. As you play through the game, each level introduces new elements: Tsavo Highway introduces vehicles, Sierra 117 introduces weapons and Crow's Nest introduces heaps of brutes.

During campaigns, you'll notice that unlike Halo 2, the environments look different from checkpoint to checkpoint; in the previous game, it seemed as if you were going down the same room and corridor at every turn. 

The artificial intelligence is also a lot smarter than in most games. The intelligence seen in heroic and legendary difficulty levels is shocking and offers a new challenge to veteran players. The Flood is back, this time harder to kill and appearing in more devastating forms.

Most importantly, each level contains a revealing piece of Halo 3's plot. Through campaign mode, the answers to all of the most desired questions will be revealed. Will the Chief die? Do the humans die? Who are the Forerunners? Although Campaign answers some gaping questions, the game's meat is the multiplayer mode. Halo 3 brings to the table the largest and most comprehensive online experience to date. Through the Xbox Live service, you can play with up to 16 people. You have the choice of either playing in social, more relaxed matches, or ranked matches, which are extremely competitive. If you play in ranked matches, you increase your skill. The more matches you win, the higher your skill level becomes. 

You also gain EXP (experience) as you win matches, promoting you through the ranks; Halo 3 has a rank system that goes from recruit to general, though only a select few ever make it to the latter.

One of the new features that has players salivating is the Forge. The Forge is a map editor that allows players to rearrange the map as they see fit. If a player doesn't like the location of the Spartan Laser, they can move it elsewhere. If a certain map doesn't have a flamethrower, one can be placed there. Also, every map has its own budget that can be used to buy new weapons and vehicles.

File sharing is another new trinket found within Halo 3. If you want to share maps with others, it's as easy as pushing a button; you can post the new maps and game variants on bungie.net for others to download at their leisure. 

There are 11 new maps and more on the way, ranging in size from the small Construct to the vast Sandtrap. New is the use of equipment that allows you to activate items to help you in battle. From a bubble shield that protects you from even the toughest tank to a radar jammer that will confuse your enemies, there are countless new weapons and vehicles available for fighting.

Halo 3 is perhaps the best online multiplayer game out there. It has more features than Bill Gates has money, but the single player aspect fails to deliver on the eighth mission of nine; because Campaign only has nine missions, that single flawed mission mars an otherwise solid game. Yet for multiplayer, Halo 3 is the new standard. It's time to "finish the fight."

Headline: THE RAMEN REVOLUTION: Oodles of Asian noodles
Author: Elyse Coleman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ramen noodles have often been referred to as a staple food for college students: it doesn't cost much and requires no culinary prowess other than knowing how to boil water. 

"I think, just like in Japanese culture, ramen's become a decent way to grab a quick and cheap meal," said Ed Wu, proprietor of The Ramen Blog & Other Goodies (www.ramenramenramen.net). "Of course you can't even mention ramen any more without instantly associating it with college students."

Its popularity among college students has led to its incorporation into American culture. For a decade, a giant steaming cup of Nissin's Cup Noodle could be seen in Times Square. 

Currently in post-production is The Ramen Girl, a movie about an American woman (Britney Murphy) who decides to be a ramen chef after she is abandoned in Tokyo. It's loosely based on the 1985 Japanese film Tampopo.

Hungry students can find two major producers of instant ramen in the United States, Nissin Foods and Maruchan, whose products are available in most grocery stores. Nissin Foods was the first company to produce instant ramen; instant noodles themselves were invented by the company's founder, Momofuku Ando, and first appeared in 1958 as a packaged block of hardened noodles known as Top Ramen. 

Today, these "ramen bricks" are available in a wide variety of flavors - from chicken to picante shrimp - Cup Noodles, another ramen option, comes in its own portable cup. As of 2006, more than 25 billion servings of Cup Noodles have been sold worldwide since its release in 1971.

"I personally prefer Cup Noodles over Top Ramen," said senior Dahyana Villalobos. "Though I do find the broth a bit salty. I ordinarily pour out the broth and just eat the noodles."

Ramen consists of much more than dried, precooked noodles, though. The non-instant variety is a large noodle dish served in one of four broths: shiro (salt), tonkotsu (pork bone), shoyu (soy sauce) and miso (soybean paste). Commonly included are slices of pork, hardboiled eggs, bean sprouts, seaweed and kamaboko (fish cakes).

"In Japan, instant ramen isn't just 'cheap starving student food,'" said Wu. "A lot of the instant ramen I buy is pretty fancy and expensive. Some of the bowl ramen I've bought costs $3 to $5."

While ramen is affordable, it's not something that should be eaten in excess. 

"There's been some recent discussion on the health impact of ramen," said Matt Fisher on the official ramen homepage (www.mattfischer.com/ramen). 

"It has a fair amount of fat [because] the noodles are fried, and sodium in the flavor packets but there's no reason we can't enjoy it once in awhile."

Additional brands can be found in Asian supermarkets. Lucky on 8356 Bird Road and P K Oriental Mart on 9501 Sunset Drive are good places. Alternative brands can also be found online at the Asian Food Grocer, www.asianfoodgrocer.com.

"Before, I went to Publix, but I prefer Lucky because of their variety," said Brian Samuelson, a member of the technology support staff for undergraduate education. "They have multiple packs that are vegetable based or soup based.

For those who want authentic ramen, there's Matsuri restaurant, located at 5759 Bird Road. 

However, at first, you might not realize that the restaurant serves it - it's only listed on its Japanese-language menu. Matsuri have all four broths and a bowl costs about $8. The eatery is currently closed for renovation but will be reopening at the end of the month.

Headline: Model of Health...a wellness column: Gardasil aids in cancer prevention
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I am always on the lookout for medicine advances and information that helps maintain or improve my health condition. That is why I wanted to know more and share the existence of the relatively new cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil.

Perhaps you have already heard or watched the advertising campaign of "One Less," which shows many women from different races, cultures and ages repeating that phrase, as a result of having taken the new vaccine. 

The national advertising campaign of Gardasil was launched November 2006 by Merck, a global research-driven pharmaceutical company, according to Medical News Today (medicalnewstoday.com). 

Bev Lybrand, vice president & general manager of Gardasil, said in an article titled: "Merck Launches National Advertising Campaign For Gardasil," that "the full public health benefit of reducing the burden of cervical cancer and HPV disease may be achieved through broad public awareness and vaccination with Gardasil, which is the driving force behind 'One Less.'" 

Like him, I want to make the FIU student population aware of the existence of this vaccine and its availability through University Health Services.

Gardasil is the only vaccine that could help guard women from four types of human papillomavirus, the types that might cause 70 percent of cervical cancer cases and 90 percent of genital warts cases.

Cervical cancer is a serious disease and can be life-threatening. It is caused by certain HPV types that can cause the cells in the lining of the cervix to change from normal to precancerous lessions that if not treated can turn cancerous. The National Conference of State Legislatures states that HPV infects approximately 20 million people in the United States with 6.2 million new cases each year.

It is important to know that Gardasil is designed to protect against two types of the virus that are responsible for only 70 percent of all cervical cancers, so they cannot fully protect women against the remaining 30 percent that are caused by other high-risk types of HPV, said Digene Corp, the developer of the first human papillomavirus test (HPV Test). 

So, even with the vaccine, women still need a regular pap smear and, depending on age, the HPV test.Gardasil is for girls and women ages nine through 26. The vaccine is given as three doses over six months and comes with some possible side effects such as pain, swelling, itching and redness at the injection site. 

An important issue for us, as consumers, is definitely the cost. According to Gardasil.com, many private health plans are providing coverage for Gardasil, and the levels of coverage can vary between plans. The retail price of the vaccine is $120 per dose.

Just like other medications and vaccines, only a doctor or healthcare professional can decide when and why Gardasil is good for you, so if you want more information about the vaccine, visit your local health center or www.gardasil.com.

Headline: Review: Lair (Game)
Subheadline: Tutorial essential to mastering basics
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Lair is one of the most highly anticipated Sony PlayStation 3 titles since the system's launch. 

Given, developer Factor 5's impressive track record with the Star Wars Rogue Squadron series for Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo Gamecube, Lair had the makings of a sure-fire hit: top-notch presentation, full six-axis flight control, dragons and carnage. Alas, not everything worked in Factor 5 and Sony's favor leaving a good game with glaring issues, rather than a blockbuster

Lair tells a story of fear, war and a once single civilization now split into two: the Asylians and the Mokai. As talks of peace between the two cultures are hushed by an assassination, Rohna, a member of the Asylian Sky Guard, is drawn into the impending conflict and must fight to stop both warring sides.

Right from the outset, veterans of Rogue Squadron will recognize Lair's mission layout, medal ranking system and simple control scheme, but those are where the similarities end. 

In the place of an X-Wing, your steed is a mighty dragon and while the sensation of burning and ripping your enemies out of the sky with your mount is powerful, controlling your beast is far from easy. 

Using six-axis support, tilting the controller in the direction you wish to go works simple enough. However, maneuvers like a 180-degree turn often tend to give more trouble along with a shoddy lock-on system that, at times, allows your dragon to pursue and fight enemy fliers one-on-one or set targets ablaze with fire breath. 

The key flaw in Lair's control is that they cannot be adjusted in any way at all, whether it is adjusting motion-sensitivity or allowing analog support. 

While this does not render the game completely unplayable, much time will be needed in the tutorial to master the basics of flight. Ground controls for your dragon are far more forgiving and scorching and tearing through scores of soldiers is easy. 

The game spans 14 missions, and with a lot of extra content and mounts, the game will keep players busy, even though you might spend much of your time struggling with the controls amidst the aerial chaos.

While there are some frame rate issues, the graphics are brimming with detail. Beautifully crafted cutscenes between missions help draw the player in further with excellent voice work for the dialogue. Lair's crowning achievement in the audio category is John Debney's amazing soundtrack; full orchestral score with memorable tracks throughout the game breathe life into Lair's atmosphere.

While a bit wild with its control and execution, Lair manages to be a great experience with its sound and fury, despite being far from what media hype projected.

Headline: State task force addresses safety
Author: Jessica Solis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To prevent inadequate safety at Florida public universities, Gov. Charlie Crist established the Gubernatorial Task Force for University Campus Safety last summer.

The task force was created initially to discuss safety and prevention measures in the wake of the events at Virginia Tech, but its discussions shifted to staffing public safety and university police departments in Florida universities.

Student leaders and administrators from FIU and other public universities in Florida were part of the task force. 

Among its objectives: determining ways in which the State University System could increase funding for safety measures as well as mental health education and awareness.

Student Government Council-UP President Marbely Hernandez was one of only two students assigned to the task force in the state.

Visiting different campuses and meeting with other University officials allowed Hernandez and other FIU representatives to evaluate FIU's prevention efforts in comparison to other schools in the state.  

"It gave us a chance to see how we run things and to see if it's either lacking from other universities or if other universities are lacking what we already have," Hernandez said.

The task force was created after President George W. Bush asked U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt and other Cabinet members to research campus safety throughout the nation. 

Gov. Crist then signed an order to have the issue researched in Florida, and after visiting the different campuses, the task force sought to recommend several practices for crisis situations on college campuses to the U.S. Department of Education.

FIU's Director of Public Safety Bill King expressed a need for an improved public safety department. According to King, FIU has one certified officer for every 1,000 students and the Florida average is lower than the national average. Recruiting and retaining officers were concerns. 

"I think our staffing levels right now are adequate, but we'd like to see more officers available," King said. "I think we'd be able to provide a number of other types of services and be much more visible if we had more people but, the budget being as it is, we understand that sometimes our staffing can't be as we like it."

The accessibility of psychological health services was also a priority. After his death, Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho was found to have a history of mental health problems. 

Cheryl Newell, director of the University Counseling Center at FIU, informed the task force of FIU's counseling availability. Newell outlined that FIU's counseling center, which is accredited by the International Association of Counseling Services, needs to double its staff to comply with the association's staffing requirements. Currently, the center has a total of 21 people providing clinical services to the FIU community. Of that total, 11 are licensed psychologists.

Newell detailed FIU's use of a consultation system that "provides the opportunity to walk in and be seen in half an hour."

Although the state did not require any mandates to be implemented, Hernandez and other FIU representatives learned of new ways to increase safety and prevention services on campus.

One item: Mobile Campus, a free text messaging system through which students receive University bulletins to their cellular phones.

"Students could pick where they'd want to get text messages from; kind of encouraging them to set it to campus safety and, if something were to happen, where students shouldn't come to campus or they shouldn't leave certain areas, they would be able to receive a text message letting them know," Hernandez said.

Following the meetings, the task force presented its recommendations to the Crist. According to Hernandez, there is a chance for a similar committee to resurface and perhaps remain permanent.

The French introduced Americans to baguettes and berets and, starting Oct. 1, the French Honor Society and Le Cercle Français -both student organizations- will present French films in their annual film festival. 

This semester, the club is pursuing a French-Canadian theme to show students the importance of learning the French language. 

"French is spoken not only in France and we would like our students to remember that by learning French they can connect not only with France but with the whole world," said French professor Maria Antonieta Garcia.

According to Begoñe Cazalis, Le Cercle Français' secretary, every movie is presented in French by a student from Garcia's advanced French conversation class. 

Students presenting include Mirtha Soto, Lisa Ware, Esther Gomez, Adriana Palacios, Mariana Carrasquel, Maria Fernanda Garcia-Castillo and Noriko Pomphrey.

Carrasquel, who is alospecial events coordinator for Le Cercle Français, said the purpose of the club is "to broaden our knowledge on the culture of francophone (French speaking) countries and to practice French with other students." 

One way the club does this is by hosting a themed film festival every year

"The festival accomplish a recreational as well as an educational purpose, that's why we present films from different parts of the francophone world," Garcia said.

Headline: KEEPING THE PEACE: Inequality in criminal charges
Author: Joseph Marhee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Apparently racism and ignorant biases are alive and well, especially in Jena, Louisiana. In the summer of 2006, Six African-American students were charged with attempted second-degree murder following an assault on a white student who was a part of a beating to several African-Americans a few days prior. 

Whether you're black or white, this much is obvious: both the white and black students were involved in an ongoing feud allegedly stemming from an incident at Jena High School. The incident then evolved into a series of beatings, "white on black" and subsequently "black on white". In matters like this, both groups should have been tried and sentenced in a just and appropriate manner.

 Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The white students were merely suspended from school while the black students were arrested and charged with attempted second-degree murder, which by defininition is premeditated, making it a very serious offense. 

According to police information released by CNN, the African-American students acted out of self-defense. One example involved 17-year-old Robert Bailey who was attacked with a bottle by 22-year-old Justin Sloan, who is subsequently charged with simple battery. Bailey, one of the "Jena six", is not one of the three whose charges have been reduced to aggravated assault, but has since been additionally charged with conspiracy to commit murder as well. Bailey then attacked in his defense Sloan; only Bailey was arrested and jailed. 

Mychal Bell was the first to be sentenced, but the sentence was overturned when the trial had been postponed because it was undecided if Ball and the other's cases needed to be refilled and tried in a Juvenile Court, but regardless, the allegations against them are unfair in the respect that they acted out of a very real sense of fear for their lives when threatened.

The initial threats came in the form of nooses hanging from a tree, which the black students felt they had to ask for permission to sit under. This incident resulted in the subsequent suspension of the white students who did it. That was the end of the persecution of the white students, despite the ongoing physical attacks and threats.

The undeniable racial divide in Jena, according to MSNBC, further expanded in the past two weeks because the almost insurmountable opposition to the black students being acquitted, but this decision is almost equally supported. Close to 20,000 demonstrators marched upon Jena in protest against the possibility of the students being imprisoned unjustly while the white students were allowed to go free.

Shouts of "Black Power" and "No Justice, No Peace" must have been intimidating, but not enough to pull the Louisiana Court System of the 1850's to the logical closure point that "if the white students are innocent, then these kids are too," as one unidentified Jena resident said to a CNN reporter. 

Other residents see the miscarriage of justice as something of a surprise. "We are not a racial town. We get along with each other, we get along fine. This is something that got out of proportion. It really has," said Terry Adams, a Jena resident. Adams also said that the black and white populations of Jena have always gotten along well until August 2006.

Roland Martin of CNN compared the demonstrations in Jena to the Million Man March of 1995, the sort of monolithic, intimidating support that just cannot be substituted. 

Martin also makes several points to the effect of why should the "white on black" beating go uninvestigated and the "black on white" beating is on the verge of becoming a hate crime? Martin seems to be implying that the district attorney, police, and possibly the town of Jena has a closeted attitude about racism. 

While the residents vehemently insist that racism has never been a prior issue in Jena, Racism isn't really what this whole issue is about. Race is just something that happened to have been paid a lot of attention to because of proximity and the obvious racial tension in the Jena area despite the "noose incident's" obvious intention to be offensive to the black students. Racism is the only seemingly rational explanation, but in actuality, the upheaval of the judicial system is the real crime.

The demonstration has been more about justice rather than which race was beaten worse.  The point being that today it's six black students from Jena, but next it could be six Cubans from Westchester. The public needs to speak out against miscarriages of justice such as these. I'm not saying the "Jena six" are completely without guilt, but thousands and myself are saying that if these six are guilty, then the white students are too. As Martin so finely stated, "It's not your race that matters in this, it's your voice that counts."

Headline: Editorial: Racism and hate crimes still prevalent
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
When Stephen Barnett was attacked by several teens with baseball bats, it showed that we still a long way from sovling the problem of racism and prejudices.

Sadly, we've taken an apathetic approach to racism. We let it slide with a grain of salt unless the event was gruesome and brutal. 

But wait, didn't racism disappear with the civil rights movement of the '70s?

Apparently not. 

Racism merely hid quietly in homes and lonely towns were its root were deeply placed for decades. 

Becoming a public taboo, racism never really went away, its power just lessened.

Being openly racist these days is like waving a red flag that says 'prosecute me'-and no one is really into flaunting their hatred so publicly.  

That is why racism is seen at the most unexpected times, in places where it cannot attract too much attention .   

For example, on bathroom stalls walls where its writer's face can remain anonymous.  

Or within secluded island parties where the police are too far to hear the slurs and threats of death as they arise from young and violent voices.

 Racism, being publicly unacceptable, has found its way to express itself behind our backs.

But let us not forget that the civil rights movement was only a few decades ago. 

It is remarkable though, how racism has died down greatly since then.

 But how does it still exist when so many cultures live and commune together peacefully on a daily basis? 

Maybe because it doesn't need to be outwardly cruel. It can exist in our minds. 

 As the occasional stranger walks by, we can assume that they are dumb or lower than us simply because of how they look-it's that easy. 

Or maybe it is because racism is traditional. 

It is passed down from family to family like an heirloom of sorts and children pass it down to their children and so on. Cultural upbringing is a potent force in maintaining racism.

 In contrast to the Jena 6 controversy, this incident pitted Hispanics against blacks, rather than the age-old archetype of white versus black. This shows racism has diversified from its previous incarnations. 

 Like religion or politics, racism can be equally taught and followed without question. 

Let the recent hate crime against Barnett and his buddies be an example for all: racism is still here and still a threat, even among our younger generation.

 But sadly, we all knew it was around. 

What happened to those students must have been a traumatizing experience, let alone a wake-up call to never attend parties where the police are not an arms reach away. 

It's going to take a long time before prejudices and racism are all but gone.

Racism might as well be the oldest living, irrational emotion next to love. 

Although, to acknowledge how long racism has been around-for centuries-allows us to realize that it will not disappear within a matter of decades. 

It will take a very, very long time to eradicate. 

But let us take the initiative to quicken and cure this bizarre disease-let us educate others when a stereotype is uttered, and let us erase the slurs on bathroom stalls instead of walking right past it.

There are over 360,000 NCAA athletes and most of us are going pro in something other than sports.  

The NCAA ad campaign rings true here at FIU.

The number of FIU graduates that have signed professional athletic contracts and made any type of impact in the professional ranks can be counted with two hands.

Mike Lowell plays third base for the Boston Red Sox, Steve Ralston is a midfielder for the New England Revolution in the MLS. 

Raja Bell plays shooting guard for the Phoenix Suns. Tyrone Marshall, a member of the Jamaican national soccer team, currently plays for Toronto FC in the MLS.

Carlos Arroyo plays for the Orlando Magic.

Nick Turnbull was the first Golden Panther to make the jump to the NFL. He was signed as a free agent by the Atlanta Falcons and eventually made it to the Bears in the 2006 season, making their Super Bowl roster as a special teams player.

Antwan Barnes and Chandler Williams joined Turnbull in the NFL when they were selected by the Baltimore Ravens and the Minnesota Vikings, respectively, in the 2007 NFL draft, representing FIU football in the draft for the first time in the program's five-year history. 

Barnes signed a three-year deal with the Ravens, while Williams was released by the Vikings and was then signed to the Miami Dolphins' practice squad.

So that's it, a whopping six FIU student-athletes that have made a name for themselves in the professional ranks in the last decade with Barnes and Chandler hoping to do the same one day. If you're a big FIU fan, then perhaps you have heard of all these guys. If not, maybe only Lowell rings a bell.

Regardless, I think it makes a good point. Today's FIU student-athletes should have fun while it lasts, but it is absolutely essential that they spend their four years in school utilizing their scholarships by attending class and getting that valuable college degree.

So far, not so good. FIU was dealt a blow by the NCAA by stripping the school of 12 scholarships, including nine from football.

The 2006 NCAA Division I Graduation Success Rate (GSR) Data - the most recent report publicly released - shows some staggering figures.

The GSR is a figure created by the NCAA that takes the school's graduation rate, adds in transfers and subtracts those students that are "allowable exceptions" - those who either die or become permanently disabled and those who leave to join the armed forces, foreign service or a church mission.

According to the report, the good news is that the four-year graduation rate of student-athletes at FIU is just a shade under the four-year graduation rate for all students.

The bad news is that the graduation rate for all students is only 47 percent. The GSR for FIU athletes is 62 percent, which falls far below Florida, Florida State and Miami's GSR but slightly above FAU. 

The graduation rate for all NCAA Division I schools is 77 percent.  

Based on these numbers, athletic director Pete Garcia needs to and   has started to emphasize on graduation and education rather than worry about donors for the Panther Club at the new football stadium or season tickets sales. 

Garcia is a business man, but with graduation rates like FIU has seen in the past, the new AD could be captaining a sinking ship.  

This problem is certainly not Garcia's fault. The blame likely falls on the former athletics administration. Garcia, however, is now in a position to right this ship. 

He has taken action and hired consultant firm Bond, Schoeneck and King - along with General Counsel Chrisitna Mendoza - to formulate a plan to improve personnel and resources.

Some other possible solutions to the problem include, but are not limited to coaches actively continuing to monitor their team and stressing education; coaches putting more effort to recruit kids with better high school records; internal ramifications from the athletic department imposing penalties on teams with poor graduation rates or rewards for those that have high rates and postgraduate opportunities, such as postgraduate scholarships and perhaps an athletic office devoted to assisting athletes with career options.

Let's be honest. All things considered there really haven't been too many successes on the field for FIU athletics in its three decades of existence and success comes in many forms. 

Stressing education and increasing graduation rates will certainly be a selling point for Garcia and his staff to donors and the state in general, which provide funding and future recruits.

Headline: Commentary: Volleyball will succeed if they follow five steps
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Prior to a pair of home games Sept. 28-29, the women's volleyball team was off to a dream-like, 8-2 start, winning all three of its first conference games in the process. With talk of championship already swirling around campus, let's break down the top five reasons why claiming that title will be challenging. 



Who is the third option offensively? 



Two weeks before the start of this season, coach Danijela Tomic and the Golden Panthers got the kind of surprise that no championship contender likes: hocking news that one of their key pieces, Arasay Guerra, no longer wanted to be a part of the team. When Guerra submitted a transfer request, it left a sudden void in the team's offense. Her 284 kills last season and clutch play solidified her as part of the big three, along with Olga Vergun and Sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa. This season, Guerra's output has not been missed thanks to the emergence of senior Anita Szymanska, junior Mariana Drumeva and freshman Ines Medved. The three have been taking turns stepping up in support of the Rosa and Vergun. One of the three or somebody else on the team will have to consistently step up night in and night out if the team hopes to make it all the way.



Consistency



When the team fell short after a brilliant regular season run last season, everyone pointed to their inconsistency. Against tougher competition, the Golden Panthers seemed to stay focused and played hard in every set. However, the same effort was not exerted in every game as the team probably took some of the less talented teams for granted. This season, the team has exhibited more of a killer instinct. The team now charges into the first set, but then plays a lackadaisical second set like last season. With expectations higher than last season, the Golden Panthers must use that pressure to motivate them to stay focused and eliminate lapses.



Tough Schedule



Last season, the Golden Panthers played 13 of their regular season games at home and opened the season with a three-game home stand. This season, the team started the season with a tough, three-game stretch in three nights in Louisiana and will play just eight regular season games overall at the beloved Pharmed Arena. Talk about tough. Despite their impressive 10-5 road record last season, there is no doubt that the team performs better at home in front of their raucous home crowd. Not only do home games inject the players with an extra shot of confidence and give a momentum advantage, but it also rattles the opposing team in pressure situations.



Defense



Whenever you have players like Rosa and Vergun leading your team, scoring will likely be the last thing you need to worry about. The Golden Panthers can score with ease against any defense in the country, but can they defend like they need to in order to make it to the promise land? That remains to be seen. The Golden Panthers are a good defensive team and get the stops that matter more times than not, However, last season they struggled stopping the elite teams, especially in the final set of crucial matches. So far this season, Szymanska is leading the team with 40 blocks, Mina Apasojevic has 31, Vergun has 24 and Rosa 23. In order for the team to get over the hump, everybody has to make more of a commitment defensively by playing aggressively and being in the spots assigned by coach Tomic. 



Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee



Even though the Golden Panthers shouldn't take any team lightly, the two teams that the Golden Panthers have to learn to beat are the Western Kentucky Hill toppers and the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders. After sharing the Sun Belt Conference title with the two last season, the race for supremacy is on once again. Middle Tennessee is off to a 15-1 start and is 2-0 in conference play. Junior Ashley Adams is up to her old tricks, leading the team  with 262 kills and 62 blocks this season. 

Meanwhile, Western Kentucky is off to an impressive 13-3 start with virtually the exact team from last year. Don't be surprised if the Sun Belt Conference goes down to the wire between these three East Division teams again. Presently Denver sits atop the West Division with a mediocre 8-7 mark.  

The Golden Panthers have all the ingredients that they had last year: talent, a dominant scorer, good defense and a great coach. 

However, the team has much better chemistry and a greater level of focus this year, because it expects to win. 

I look forward to the team's first real test when they face off against division foes Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee Oct. 12 and 13, respectively, at Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Board votes to raise tuition
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Florida's Board of Governors voted unanimously Sept. 27 to raise the state's undergraduate tuition for the coming spring semester by 5 percent. 

The tuition increase will only apply to in-state students and will equal $55 for a student enrolled full-time - less than $4 per credit hour. 

However, some believe the Legislature will not approve the BOG's decision. 

The board's decision follows a state battle between the BOG and the Legislature for the authority to control tuition.

The BOG, which was created in 2002, believes it should have the power to regulate tuition without the approval of the Legislature or governor. 

"This is where all the gray area is…who has the authority to set tuition?" said FIU Provost Ronald Berkman. "That is a unanswered question. Right now the BOG has asserted that it has the authority. Can this be implemented without Legislative approval?  I think the answer is yes. I think we can go ahead an charge a 5 percent tuition difference. I think there's going to be a lot of discussion about this."

Gov. Charlie Crist originally vetoed a 5 percent tuition increase last summer, which prompted the BOG to tell all Florida public universities to prepare for budget cuts between 4 and 10 percent.

"We want to offset the cuts…and then we want to make sure that our universities hire additional faculty, hire additional advisors and make some of that increase available for student financial aid," said Mark Rosenberg, Chancellor of the State University System.

Berkman and Rosenberg said that the Senate and House recommended to increase tuition by 5 percent as well.

"Remember that it still has to be approved by the Legislature and the governor has not vetoed it. So it's not a done deal yet. In our case, it's done deal," Rosenberg said.

On July 6, the BOG joined a lawsuit filed by former Gov. Bob Graham that would strip the Legislature of any power to raise or lower tuition. 

The outcome of the lawsuit is still pending in court. 

"The purpose of the lawsuit is to determine who sets tuition in Florida," Rosenberg said. "The [BOG] exercised it's authority yesterday when it voted to increase tuition. What the board is saying is that they have the authority and the lawsuit will determine that once and for all."

Rosenberg said that the increase would generate $9.5 million, and added that the funds are needed considering lawmakers are looking to cut $1.1 billion in state spending.

On Sept. 6, Crist surprised the FIU and University of Central Florida by announcing that the two universities' plans for medical schools would have to be delayed due to low state revenues. 

Berkman said that the cuts and proposed increase won't affect FIU's College of Medicine because its funding has already been approved by Gov. Crist and the Legislature.

"He can not veto anything in the existing budget," Berkman said. "When the budget is complete and when the legislature signs off and complete the budget, it becomes law."

Headline: Convocation honors faculty, staff
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Faculty Convocation Week 2007 open this week with a series of events to commemorate professors  for their hard work. 

It is a way for FIU to honor its faculty through both monetary and prestigious awards.

"It's recognition by their colleagues of their accomplishments," said Bruce Hauptli, chair of the faculty senate.  

During this year's convocation, 31 faculty members from every campus of the University will be honored. 

The awards are broken into six categories this year; advising, service, teaching, mentoring, adjuncts and research and scholarly activity. 

Normally there is also an award for librarianship, but there were no nominees for that category this year. 

Each of the 31 faculty members will receive an award Oct. 5 during an awards ceremony at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center starting at 9 a.m. 

During the awards ceremony, the Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty Award will also be given to one of the 31 faculty members already being honored. 

"Even I don't know who it is," Hauptli said. 

The recipient will receive a $10,000 award on top of their $3,000 category award.

"In a year when there isn't going to be any raises, it's something to look forward to," Hauptli said. "But it's not only about the money."

To be considered for any of the awards, a faculty member must be nominated and submit an extensive report relating to their nomination category. 

Caroline Simpson, an associate professor in the College of Arts and Sciences and Physics who will be receiving one of the teaching awards, commented that the report included letters of recommendation, student evaluations, grade distribution charts and someone observing her teach a class; all worth it to Simpson. 

"I've wanted one of these awards for a while," Simpson said. "I love teaching."

The reports are then sent to the Honorary Degree and Awards Committee who reviews the files and chooses the most deserving professors. 

From there, all nominations are sent to the provost for approval.

There will be two other events celebrating the faculty: a Biscayne Bay Campus lecture and reception Oct. 2 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Wolfe University Center and a folk concert Oct. 3 at 8 p.m. with Amy Carol Webb at the University Park Faculty Club.

"Although our events are not the most exciting thing in the world - and I'm not going to pretend that they are - we'd like to encourage students to attend," said James Sutton, chair of the faculty convocation.  "We have 250 seats [for students] and we'd like them to be filled."
