Headline: New points system keeps clubs active
Author: Nicole Acosta and Ever Cruz / Beacon Staff 
&nbsp;
Clubs based at the Biscayne Bay Campus need "more realistic goals" to follow, according to Joe L. Mintz, Student Organizations Council president. To meet those needs, SOC-BBC unveiled a revised list of club participation requirements at a meeting on July 17. 

For Mintz, this revised participation system, effective immediately, provides a fair middle ground between BBC clubs and SOC-BBC itself.

"This point system gives clubs certain requirements that keeps them active and accountable while not being too much time-consuming and letting the clubs concentrate on their own activities," Mintz said.

The new Fall requirements for SOC-BBC club participation allows new and existing clubs to earn a maximum of 10 mandatory points if they meet certain requirements. Some of these requirements are to have a table during a minimum of two SOC club fairs each semester or to have at least one representative from a club schedule and attend a one-on-one meeting with the SOC-BBC president or vice president.

Clubs can earn a maximum of 21 points if they follow the additional credit requirements, such as attending monthly leadership luncheons held by the Center for Leadership and Service or completing a community service project.

With the new SOC-BBC point system, clubs can use some of the extra credit requirements to meet the mandatory club requirements and can seek approval for this from Mintz, according to Ivy Siegel, SOC-BBC advisor.

For a club to be active and fully funded, or earn $600 in the Fall semester, as well as to remain eligible to make room reservations at BBC, clubs must submit all their paperwork by Sept. 21. To still be considered an active club and be partly funded, clubs must submit their paperwork by Oct. 31.

According to Siegel, clubs must earn a minimum of five points in order to receive 50 percent funding based on funding availability at the time.

Clubs must also meet 10 requirements and earn 10 points by Dec. 14 in order to be eligible for funding in the Spring. 

The previous SOC-BBC participation requirements required clubs to meet a minimum of 12 items per semester and each organization had to attend four meetings and four events sponsored by FIU.

"The old point system did burden clubs, so we wanted to make something that was easy, would keep them active and be realistic," Mintz said. "The old system would keep them active but it was unrealistic."

According to Siegel, the new SOC-BBC participation requirements were based on research done of the SOC system at University Park and other systems used by other universities that FIU uses as a model, such as the University of Florida. Siegel said she, Vicky Owles, associate director of the Department of Campus Life and Orientation at BBC, and the SOC-BBC executive board did the research.

As a result, "some things were eliminated, some things were added. It's more user friendly," Siegel said.

"We want clubs that want to participate and be around and give awareness that students can join, so they can know there's a club for them to get involved in," she said.

According to Mintz, the previous participation requirements were suspended in the Spring.

Mintz said that out of the 34 clubs active under SOC-BBC last year, the Invitational Scholars organization was the only club that followed the previous participation system and documented their activities.

"Clubs had nothing required for them to be active on campus and it was a problem," Mintz said. "We were way off course [before] and we needed to be more realistic in our expectations. We're a smaller campus with less involvement."

Mintz is hopeful that clubs will adhere to the new participation requirement system, since about 30 people showed up to the July 17 meeting.

"Things are looking better in SOC nowadays. Clubs are registering in the summer and it's typically hard to get people out to meetings for existing clubs," Mintz said. "Involvement is rising and we need to keep it rising."

John Morris, president of the Biscayne Bay Dramatics, is also hopeful about the new participation requirement system.

"I've seen variations of the point system, I actually think this is probably one of the better ones they've had," Morris said. "Before, I would say, the point system was a little over the top. This is more generic, what clubs should actually do."

Headline: SJMC students place second in competition
Author: Ana Davis and Peggy Exum√© / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
After graduating from FIU last spring, seven advertising and public relations students from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication received an e-mail that brought them international attention. 

The students were Emmanuel Amador, Tania Berg, Christine Chutino, Velma Ferguson, Kathleen Oliva, Ivan Sevillia and Annia Mendez-Villamil. They found out this summer that their advertising campaign submission to the International Advertising Association's annual InterAd IX competition which provides hands-on marketing communications experience for undergraduate students worldwide, won second place among 50 entries in the United States/Canada division of the May competition. 

The campaign, "Domino Effects Communication" was completed as part of the student's Intergrated Communication Campaigns class requirement. 

In the class, the group was chosen to enter the contest based on their strengths and background.

"I treat my campaigns students as employees in an agency. All campaign students in my class have to fill out a job application, submit their resumes, and provide their unofficial transcripts," said Rosanna Fiske, professor in the Department of Advertising and Public Relations, who was the group's advisor.

The students completed an entire advertising and marketing campaign to support the United Nations' Millennium Program, an effort to eradicate poverty worldwide. According to a press release by the University, teams were asked to conduct situation analyses, determine strategies and prepare creative executions, media plans and promotional recommendations. Each regional team was judged regionally by professionals from the IAA. 

According to the contest's guidelines, the goals of each group's campaign must be achievable by 2015.

Campaigns is a capstone course in which students apply the knowledge they have gained from previous courses, according to Catherine Ahles, associate professor and chair of the Department of Advertising and Public Relations.

For Ahles, the student's achievement is validation for the department.

"We have known for years that this is a top program, but all schools say that. The proof is that we have taken students' work and compared it to other top students [worldwide]," Ahles said.

Chutino and her classmates worked as an agency. They were required to solve a problem for a real client, the United Nations Millennium Campaign, to gather market data and prepare a marketing plan and supporting creative materials. 

"The students have gained a great deal of confidence about their work in addition to putting together first-class pieces for their portfolios," Fiske said. "The students have to do all of the work themselves. The results are 100 percent their ideas, their research, their creativity, their execution."  

The regional winners and runners up received InterAd XI certificates and plaque announcing their achievements.

This is FIU's second win in the competition. In 2005, a team of students, working with the name "Sneakers and Suits" won first place in the US/Canada regional competition which earned them the right to compete against other regional winners from around the world. That group went on to place second worldwide.  

"The IAA InterAd competition provides students with real-world deadlines and experiences [and] the clients are usually challenging and excellent. The competition also allows already great students, who are usually at the top of their class, to learn how to interact in an agency environment," Fiske said.

According to Chutino the project cost her many nights of sleep but it was worth it.

"We wanted to celebrate but everyone is away for the summer right now. [The] excitement and joyous occasion came when we actually finished our product anyway. It was great to see creative advertisements around you, but it's even cooler when you actually created it," Chutino said.

Headline: Caffeinated Craze: Accepted drug consumed by students, professors alike
Author: Kassandra Pool / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Red Bull, Coca-Cola, Rock Star, coffee and tea. 

All of these products have one thing in common: caffeine, one of the world's most widely used drugs. 

Many students are guilty of using caffeine at some point in their lives to stay awake such as Student Programming Council President Sophia Del Zoppo, who wasn't a regular tea consumer until two months ago. 

"It helps me wake up when I am very tired. The only downside is that caffeine always makes me crash towards the end," Del Zoppo said. "It makes me really anxious and I sometimes start shaking, so I try not to drink too much of it at once because I tend to get side effects."  

GlobalHealthandFitness.com states that more than 90 percent of Americans consume caffeine daily. 

According to John Hopkins University's Department of Neuroscience, the average person drinks about 250 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is equivalent to about 1 to 2 cups of coffee or 3 to 5 bottles of soft drinks. 

Tea alone contains anywhere between 30-60 mg of caffeine depending on how long it's been brewed.

Within 5 to 30 minutes of consumption, caffeine takes effect in one's blood stream, depending on how much food is in the stomach and the concentration of caffeine in the product. 

The drug keeps its users alert and awake, increasing the heart rate and respiration of the consumer. 

Caffeine produces such an effect because it blocks adenosine, a chemical created in the brain that induces sleep, from binding to receptors.

 If taken in excessive amounts, however, the stimulant may produce some adverse side effects: headaches, insomnia, feelings of restlessness and even anxiety.

A person who is accustomed to drinking caffeine but suddenly decides to stop one day may experience withdrawal symptoms, which leads researchers to speculate whether or not this stimulant is addicting. 

"I don't know the literature off hand, whether it's addicting or not, but there are two aspects of the addiction-physiological and psychological addiction," said Dr. Bradley C. Bennett, director of The Center for Ethnobiology and Natural Products at FIU.

Depending on a person's definition of "addiction," one might agree that caffeine is addicting because of its potential withdrawal symptoms as well as the physiological effects it produces on the body, particularly the manipulation of the chemical dopamine, which affects pain and pleasure sensation. 

The stimulant's effect on dopamine levels is similar to that of drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

For those desiring to abruptly quit caffeine products, the risk of finding themselves experiencing nausea, fatigue, headaches and upset stomach is a possibility. 

Therefore, it is better to gradually slow down the caffeine intake in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms, which mathematics professor Elizabeth Nicoli-Suco experiences when she doesn't have her morning cup of java.

 "I feel very good when I have my cup of coffee and I'm teaching," Nicoli-Suco said, coffee in hand. "If I don't drink the coffee, then I do get some withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches in the morning."

Although coffee is a common choice for students and professors who need to stay awake, there are other alternatives for caffeine lovers. 

One alternative for a morning pick-me-up is apples. They contain no caffeine but produce a similar effect on the human body.

Despite its potential drawbacks, some people continue to buy and consume caffeinated products. 

Students such as freshman Geraldine Perez agree that caffeine allows you to function throughout the day after a long night of studying or grading papers.  

"You need that kick to start your day especially after a really long night of doing essays and papers," Perez said. "It does the body good."

Headline: The Meaning of Life...a column looking for the answers: Beat poet exemplifies "in love with life" philosophy
Author: C. Joel Marino / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"I saw that my life was a vast glowing empty page and I could do anything I wanted."

-Jack Kerouac, "The Dharma Bums"



Jack Kerouac drank until he couldn't drink anymore and then the alcohol killed him. When I first found out that's how the famous Beat poet died, I had just one reaction: "That is so cool."

I fell under the allure of the Beat generation at the end of my sophomore year, the midpoint of my college career. 

For weeks at a time, all I could read were the rabid works of Ginsberg, Burroughs, Ferlinghetti and any of those other mid-century rebels.

But none grabbed me like Kerouac. Concise poems, drunken interviews, novels that read like Greek epics - Kerouac became my patron saint.

Take this passage from his landmark work, "On the Road:"

"I shambled after them as I've been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars ... " and so on.

Reading the book between classes, I would look at course notes piling across my desk, at the computer screen shimmering with Excel charts and PowerPoint presentations, and I would tell myself that this couldn't be life - that this couldn't be what I desired. 

I had to be mad to live, mad to be saved from irksome responsibilities and this wasn't the way to do it: I had to be a rebel.

Kerouac turned rebellion into a philosophy.

"You're a genius all the time," he wrote in his famous guide to spontaneous prose. "Be in love with your life ‚Ä¶ Blow as deep as you want to blow." 

Kerouac envisioned a radical individualism freed from the constraints of responsibilities or consequences. 

To him, the only way to be saved was to never submit.

I wanted to gobble life like Kerouac. Casting my notes and projects aside.

I saved up a few hundred dollars and took a three week trip to Canada with my best friend, leaving all complaints and expectations behind.

I found out about Kerouac's grave while talking to a bookstore owner in Vermont. 

We made a brief sidetrack to pay respects to the man who had inspired our indiscretion as though we were pilgrims racing toward a holy shrine.

Though there is a monument in Kerouac's hometown of Lowell, Mass., the author's grave on the outskirts of that town is nothing more than an unadorned plaque surrounded by grass. 

Visiting fans leave cigarette butts, empty beer bottles and signs scrawled in crayon to show that they too intend to party until death.

And that's where the rebel lies.

"Accept loss forever," Kerouac wrote in his guide.

I looked at Kerouac's name scribbled in gold on that tiny plaque. 

Where was the man who loved life too much to conform to one system or style? 

Where was the mad poet who had to do things his own way or not at all? 

He drank until he couldn't drink anymore and then the alcohol killed him. 

This was a loss too hard to accept.

I eventually returned to my studies and moved on to other writers and phases. 

I still read Kerouac from time to time, and I admire his talent more than any of the other Beat poets. 

But more than anything, I learned from his writing,

 I'll remember what I learned while standing over his grave: those who try to swallow life might end up choking on it.

- The search for meaning continues this Fall.

Headline: Review: Prince - Planet Earth (Music)
Author: Chris Towers / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Depending on who you ask, Prince is either the king of funk, a guitar god, an R&B crooner or a wholly pretentious, indecipherable symbol. Because of these reinventions, Prince's music has always been difficult to predict and impossible to recreate.

Unfortunately, following a decade-long battle with his record company in the '90s, Prince seemed to finally be out of new ideas. His music had settled into dull territory and Prince had fallen from grace.

However, in 2004 and 2006, Prince released Musicology and 3121 and saw a return to commercial success, if not a full return to his artistic glory days. 

With combined sales of more than 4 million, these albums have seen Prince return to his status as a commercial force.

His latest album, Planet Earth, continues in the vein of those two previous albums as another focused, hook-heavy album of R&B grooves, which includes a welcomed return to his guitar based '80s music at times.

 While songs such as "Mr. Goodnight" and "Future Baby Mama," which are more based on the successful R&B style from his past two efforts, are enjoyable, there are a few tracks that go beyond that formula and benefit from a live band sound and a renewed sense of energy.

In this mold, the first single, "Guitar," stands out as the strongest track on the record. Featuring a catchy, danceable hook and some impressive guitar work, it is definitely the most uptempo track on the album. It wouldn't sound out of place on his '80s albums alongside hits such as "Little Red Corvette" and "1999."

Sandwiched between the title track, which is a socially conscious look at the problems facing our generation, and the slow jazz inspired "Somewhere Here On Earth," "Guitar" provides a necessary boost of energy to an album that tends to lean towards grooves instead of hooks.

Aside from "All The Midnights Of The World," which sounds like a poorly conceived Christmas carol, Planet Earth stands as another solid offering from an artist who has had a rather surprising recent resurgence. 

While it's doubtful that Prince will ever again reach the commercial heights of Purple Rain or 1999, he has proven himself a successful pop force at a time when even the biggest names sometimes struggle to move albums. 

By reinventing himself yet again, Prince has managed to stay relevant in a career that has now spanned four different decades, and Planet Earth continues his recent string of strong works.

Headline: Review: Piano Squall - Game & Anime Music Emotions (Music)
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Whoever says classical music is dead obviously has not heard Game & Anime Music Emotions, the first album by Michael Gluck better known by his stage name Piano Squall. 

Gluck, a classically trained concert pianist, has been performing for charity since 2003. His overall theme is to convert music from video games and Japanese animation (anime) into piano pieces. 

GAME features 17 songs from various games and anime and one original work. 

It's amazing how well Gluck manages to translate popular songs from the anime and gaming communities to piano and the sounds he produces are euphoric to the ears. 

The songs are varied as well-- the disc is comprised of tunes that range from lively to melancholic. You have songs like "Tank" that are perfect to get your blood boiling or the slower "Every Heart" to sit down and relax to. 

Every song will conjure some sort of image in your head, even if you haven't heard the original versions of the songs or seen where they come from.  

Ironically, the longest track on the disc, "Final Fantasy Battle Medley," is also the worst track. Gluck, who takes his stage name from the Final Fantasy video game series, put a lot into this song, which is actually a compilation of many different musical scores from numerous Final Fantasy games, but the mixing of so many different pieces into one performance was the track's largest flaw. 

While Gluck managed to string them together well enough, the songs just conflicted with each other too much to be really enjoyable. 

Despite the track's shortcomings, the rest of the CD is perfect. 

In several of the tracks, Gluck mixed in his own style and composition to complement the original versions. 

Speaking of original, the last track on GAME, "Boss Battle" is a completely original composition that Gluck composed with Michael Huang, a composer and sound designer based in California.  

It may not be that long, but it's a real treat. And if you order the CD online, you will also receive another original composition called "Medieval." 

Up until this year, Gluck never sold his music, but rather gave it away on his web site Pianosquall.com. 

When he performed at various conventions, he would sell posters or take donations to raise funds for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society among other charities. 

The NMSS has a special place in Gluck's heart as his grandmother tragically died of the disease. 

Gluck will be donating 20 percent of all profits from GAME sales to charity. 

 GAME is available through Gluck's web site.

If you don't want to order it online, autographed copies will be on sale Aug. 11 and 12 at FIU during the Yasumicon anime convention, hosted by the Anything Goes Anime club.

Headline: Director discusses inter-campus shuttle service
Author: Maria Chercoles, Chris Khawand and Jose Maya / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Bill Foster, FIU's director of  the Department of Parking and Transportation, met with The Beacon to talk about plans for a night pick-up service and about the shuttle service between the two campuses.



Q: Can you tell us about the plans -with the Student Government Association- to develop a shuttle service which would take students from different parking garages to class buildings?

Foster: It's called the "public service aide program" and it will start this fall. What we are doing is working with SGA to do something at night as a safety measure or initiative.

People will be able to call a number and, within a 10  minute window, have a cart to picking them up and taking them where they are going. It will run from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. and it will especially target the dorm students. We'll also do jump starts.

It will be a free service and we are developing flyers to advertise the system. The number to call will be 305-348-1673.



Q: Are you going to increase the shuttle service between the two campuses with classes starting every hour when the three-day schedule starts?

Foster: Not at this point. The shuttle runs on a tight schedule already. Tightening that schedule up will not be something that we will correlate to the class time. 



Q: But what if, say, someone has class at 3 p.m. at the Biscayne Bay Campus. He or she would have to take the 12:50 p.m. bus, get to BBC at 1:50 p.m. and then wait around for over an hour?

Foster: Shrinking the schedule or changing the hours will present more of a problem.

If I shrink it and try to have a two o'clock bus, I would be face the challenge of what would happen if the bus is late. The other way to look at it is that if there is a delay, students won't be late to class.

We might be able to adjust the actual departure times but this might create another problem: If I correct it in the morning, then I will have the problem in the evening when classes last longer.

This will affect the rest of the day.  

If they want to take the bus, they will have to accept this. Just like with any decision with public transportation, you have to make your decisions based on the schedule. The schedule seems to work, and changing it might change everything. If I change it, then the morning person might have a  problem. Again, this is brand new so we are going to see how it works, if there are any changes we can make, we'll do it, but we have to make sure the changes help everyone, not just a small group of students.



Q: There are currently three buses. Have you thought of maybe getting an extra bus ?

Foster: I would not have a bus for a single hour because if it breaks down, you then have a problem. You don't have a back up.



Q: But when the university approved the new three-day schedule, was there an initiative to also change the bus schedule? 

Foster: No, the transportation department works independently. 

We have over 30,000 students at the University and the bus serves only  about 1,000 of them. Students pay $2 each way, but it costs about $5 and we pay the rest. It is a very expensive service but we want to provide it because we want to provide the link [between the two campuses], but this is not something that was considered when a change was made that would affect 30,000 students. It  is established in a way and you don't want to change the expectations, you have to provide something that meets what people expect.

As a student, don't you think that having a bus schedule MWF, and a  different one for Tuesdays and Thursdays would confuse students?



Q: But the University is already having different schedules for those days. Shouldn't the bus service follow the new schedule? 

Foster: We decided not to change the schedule believing that it would confuse students. If I were a college student, I would like to know the bus leaves at the same time every day. I wouldn't want to have to pull out the schedule and have to see what time the bus was leaving that particular day. 

Maybe your paper can do a poll and ask students what they think about it..

We would like to get some feedback and maybe ask students, especially those at BBC because they are the ones using the bus service most of the time. 

We are curious as to what students think. Again, it's not something we can't change, but something we decided not to change because we thought it would affect students instead of helping them. 



Q: Can you tell us more about the plans of a new parking garage?

Foster: Yes, the new garage will have about 1,450 spaces and will be located on Eight Street next to the Red Parking Garage. It will be different because it will have a retail component and also house the offices of public safety. We envision it to be an area of high demand. Completion is estimated in about two, to two and a half years.



Q: Do you have an emergency evacuation plan if, lets say, there is a bomb threat and all students rush to their cars and try to leave the University?

Foster: Yes we do. It's the Student Emergency Management Team. We can turn the roads around. Our problem would be if we have media, law enforcement and other groups of people that would try to come in, rather than those going out. We are also looking at hiring an outside company to stress pressure points, and employees would go with barricades and equipment.

Headline: THREE OF A KIND: Florida valedictorians, student elite choose FIU
Author: Susana Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The three Young sisters were waiting for their English class to start when one of their friends asked whether the rumor was true: were they really the top three of their class?

This was a surprise to twins Jaqueline and Justine Young, 17, and their younger sister Jasmine, 14, who graduated first, second and third in their class of 657 students: Jaqueline as valedictorian, Justine and Jasmine as co-salutatorians. 

"We were a bit skeptical, but we decided to check in on it anyway," Jasmine said.

"I was surprised when they told me, I never knew we'd get so much attention" Justine said, Jaqueline agreeing. 

The Young sisters, who were born in New Jersey but moved to Orlando in 1997, made FIU the university of their choice. They are part of a trend at FIU: 18 valedictorians will be joining the Golden Panther community this school year. Sixteen of them will come from South Florida high schools.

The girls, who graduated from Freedom High School, say they never planned to graduate at the head of their class. 

"You always see things like 'so-and-so graduated with high honors' in the newspaper, but you never think you'll be one of those people," Jasmine said. 

Although she did not intend to graduate early, Jasmine found herself graduating with her sisters. "I found some classes easy for me so I asked to take higher level courses."

Eventually, the 14-year old was told to skip ahead in grade levels and earned enough credits in her Advanced Placement classes to graduate with her sisters. 

According to George Young, their father, the girls were accepted to all of Florida's public universities. In the end they chose FIU because of their mutual attraction to the school. 

"The top priority was whether or not administration would look out for you," Jasmine said. "FIU gave us the attention other schools didn't."

FIU awarded Jaqueline the Valedictorian Scholarship, granting her $3,500 a year for three renewable years. FIU also awarded both Justine and Jasmine the Presidential Scholarship, granting them $2,500 a year also renewable for three years; totaling $2,000 more than the Salutatorian Scholarship they were initially offered. 

The girls were also struck by the diversity found on campus.

"We wanted to come to FIU to experience Miami," Jaqueline said. "We heard it's exciting and different from Orlando."

 "There is every ethnicity everywhere you look and that was pretty cool because you don't get that at some colleges," Jasmine said. 

To their father, their honors weren't unexpected. 

"We constantly encouraged them to excel, helping them with independent thinking and research activities as well as tutoring and explaining what we could to the best of our knowledge," George Young said in a telephone interview.

The girl's mother, JoAnn, dedicated herself as a stay-at-home mom to raise the girls. 

The girl's former English professor, Ed Chambers, is also proud of them.

"It is amazing the dedication the girls give to their education. They are extremely diligent," Chambers said in an e-mail interview.

The girls spend anywhere from three to five hours studying daily and supported each other by studying together.

"We probably would have achieved what we have independently, but working together made it easier," Jasmine said.

When asked if they were competitive amongst each other, Jasmine said, "Yeah, but it's a friendly competition."

Both Jaqueline and Jasmine are pursuing a three-by-four accelerated degree with the Honors College's Medical Education program at FIU. They'll spend three undergraduate years at FIU, completing the fourth at University of South Florida as first year medical students. The two will complete the remaining four years of the degree's graduate program at USF. 

Justine is undecided and feels no pressure to choose a major. Although she is leaning towards Medicine, she is also interested in Business.

Currently, both Jaqueline and Jasmine are taking courses for Summer B, and now live in an apartment across from University Park. 

 "The professors are very interactive with the students," Jasmine said. "You have times where you're serious about your schoolwork but you have times where you can talk to your professors as if they were your peers." 

Jasmine agreed: "I can tell I'm gonna have a good time here."

Headline: Director discusses insurance proposal
Author: Robert Dollinger / Special to the Beacon
&nbsp;
As the appointed co-chair of the Florida Board of Governors State University System Student Health Insurance Task Force with my colleague Lesley Sacher, director of the Thagard Student Health Center at Florida State University, I would like to make a few clarifications to help students and the university community better understand the rationale behind the recommendations of the Task Force. 

First, the Task Force members are appointed by the Board of Governors as recommended by senior leadership at their respective universities. 

All 11 universities are represented; however, there is no representation by the health insurance industry.

One of the five recommendations that were made to the BOG by the Task Force during their meeting June 13 at FIU, involves the implementation of a mandatory student health insurance program at all state universities using a hard-waiver option, which would apply to all new undergraduate and graduate degree-seeking students beginning Fall 2010. 

A hard-waiver system was recommended to allow students who already have sufficient health insurance coverage be able to register for classes by showing proof of adequate insurance coverage with a policy that meets standardized criteria. 

Task Force members are very sensitive to the needs of our students who are economically disadvantaged and have made as their first recommendation that financial aid be increased to cover the cost of insurance for low-income students, based on need. 

Please note that financial aid does not cover voluntary insurance plans; however, financial aid will provide funds to pay for insurance if it became a requirement. 

It is estimated that approximately 30 percent of university students in Florida are uninsured or underinsured, potentially placing achievement of their academic goals in jeopardy when an unexpected accident or serious illness threatens their financial security. 

Studies have shown that students without health insurance are less apt to receive prompt medical care when symptoms are more likely to be treated more readily. As a consequence, they miss classes and/or perform poorly. 

Also, students without health insurance are under greater stress when confronted with an illness, due to uncertainties about how to pay for their needed medical care. 

Stress can negatively impact one's performance and has been associated with increased fatigue as well as a risk factor for infections, accidents, behavioral problems and heart disease. 

Since 1989, public and private universities in many states have been requiring that all of their full-time students have insurance as a condition of enrollment. 

In 2000, the University of California instituted mandatory insurance when it was estimated that 40 percent of its undergraduate students were uninsured or underinsured and that 25 percent of all student withdrawals were due to medical reasons. 

Over the past seven years, more than 10 other public and private colleges and universities have required their students to have health insurance. In March, 2007, the American College Health Association completed an online student health insurance/benefits survey to assess trends throughout the country. 

A total of 279 private and public colleges and universities throughout the United States participated. 

Some of the key findings included: more than 90 percent of private universities require health insurance, 48 percent of public universities offer voluntary health insurance plans and 21 percent require health insurance, with one third of these institutions adding this requirement since 2000. 

Mandatory insurance eliminates risk selection, thus reducing the premium for all students while providing greater benefits.

Nothing will happen until Fall 2010, at the earliest. This gives all of the stake-holders, students, parents, university administration, and the BOG, ample time to carefully ensure that students' best interests are met, especially those who need financial assistance. 

I have met with Student Government Association representatives about this issue and would like to request that we create a student task force at FIU to further discuss the implications of this BOG recommendation, and other issues that affect the health of our students at FIU. 

I ask that our SGA leadership serve as members of this Student Health Advisory Council.

If you are a student and would like to be part of this proposed task force at FIU, please contact me via e-mail at dollinge@fiu.edu.



Dr. Robert Dollinger is the  Executive Director of FIU University Health Services.

Headline: Bobby's World...a column about social issues: State law denies homosexuals chance to start family
Author: Bobby Jo Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Unless a guy like me can figure a way to get another man pregnant, I may have to consider adoption some time in the future-far, far future. Too bad Florida state law bans homosexuals from adopting. 

The traditional reasoning is that any children I raise will be 'damaged' by having same-gendered parents. Life will suck for my kids: they'll turn out gay, their friends will hate them, they won't get invited anywhere and plus, they'll turn out gay. 

But if that's the case, then what better parent than me to understand and help them through it, right?  

The fact is we're the only state that currently has such an explicit law in place. This flies in the face of countless social science studies that have found families equally healthy and adjusted regardless of the orientation of the parents. 

It also found that homosexual parents adopt children that heterosexual couples usually do not, such as those who are older, are HIV positive or have a history of misbehavior. And no, gay parents don't gay up their kids.

Discriminatory laws like ours are a bruise on all of us. 

Without the same legal rights as other couples, homosexuals find it harder to create the cohesive family structures which necessary for a good society.

Steve Loften and Roger Croteau are two such parents, Currently appealing their lawsuit in Florida to secure the adoption of their five HIV positive children. 

The Loften-Croteau family receive mail from Florida every so often to remind them that Bert, 10, is now 'adoptable' since he no longer tests positive, according to LetHimStay.com. Meaning he could be taken away from the only family he's ever known because Loften and Croteau are banned from adopting him. 

It's clear where the real threat of 'damage' is coming from, and it has nothing to do with Loften and Croteau's sexual orientation.

Bill Maier, Focus on the Family's vice president and chief psychologist, is a major proponent of the law and advocates it other states. "[Gay parenting] hurts children because it intentionally creates motherless or fatherless families," Maier said to TIME Magazine. 

But how do you overlook that it creates families nonetheless? If we truly believe in the value of family as a foundation for society, the truth is that we need to protect it in this form too.

Headline: Editorial: New three day schedule, shuttle schedule incompatible
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
There was a time not long ago when students did not have to go to great lengths to get from FIU's University Park to the Biscayne Bay Campus. The intercampus shuttle was cheaper, offering students relatively reliable and affordable access to both campuses. 

There have been numerous factors, however, that have threatened to tarnish this convenience. 

In July 2006, the price of a roundtrip ticket peaked at $4 was the first of such inauspicious events. 

With the Fall semester approaching, students face a new hindrance to their ability to commute between campuses: the current shuttle schedule will remain the same, despite the implementation of 50-minute course times and a M-W-F schedule. 

For example, suppose a student has a 12 p.m. course at BBC this fall, he or she may consider taking the 11:20 a.m. shuttle. However, assuming ideal traffic conditions, they are not likely to get there at least until 12:15 p.m., which makes no sense. 

Thanks to the flawed schedule, they are left no choice but to take the 9:50 a.m. shuttle, which leaves them at BBC far in advance of when they need to be there. 

In the case of a student taking a 9 a.m. course at University Park, and a 12 p.m. course at BBC, the shuttle schedule is completely at odds with his or her schedule. 

The 9 a.m. course ends at the same time the shuttle arrives, 9:50 p.m; which means that he or she will miss the shuttle and be forced to wait for the 11:20 p.m. shuttle to come. He or she in all likelihood would then be late for their class. 

The inconvenience to students who have the courses for their major primarily located at BBC is significant, for they squander time and money.

 Bill Foster, director of Parking and Transportation said, "We are curious as to what students think. Again, it's not something we can't change, but something we decided not to change because we thought it would confuse students instead of helping them."

We feel that Parking and Transportation should indeed make exhaustive strides in gauging student opinion with regard to this matter. 

Yes, it is understood that such a change would initially cause confusion for some students, however, there will be a great deal of it regardless - as well as anxious moments - as a result of the three-day schedule. By making adjustments to this schedule students stand more of a chance of getting to their classes on time. 

Furthermore, confusion can be minimized by making  adjustments to the shuttle schedule prior to the start of the Fall semester, which would enable Parking and Transportation to give sufficient notification to the student body. 

Intercampus transit should be convenient for all students, rather than a costly, burdensome chore.

If the fates of the two campuses are really as intertwined as University President Modesto A. Maidique insists, then Parking and Transportation should take potential scheduling conflicts into consideration to insure that the commute between campuses is as easy and hassle-free as possible.

Headline: LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Budget cut not response to tuition veto
Author: Maydel Santana-Bravo / Director, FIU Office of Media Relations
&nbsp;
The budget story in last week's front page of The Beacon mistakenly implied that the university is facing budget cuts as a result of Governor Charlie Crist's veto of a 5 percent tuition increase. The 4 to 10 percent budget cut the University will have to make is a result of lower than expected tax revenues at the state level and completely unrelated to Crist's tuition veto.

Headline: Commentary: Volleyball duo rightfully plays for country in world championship
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Collegiate athletes should never be denied the opportunity to represent his or her country in world championship competition no matter the risks involved. 

The pride and opportunity to compete among the world's best overshadows the risk of injury.

Women's volleyball teammates, Yarismar Rosa and Nikita Valentin, find themselves playing on team Puerto Rico in the 2007 Federation Internationale de Volleyball Women's Junior Championship taking place in Nakhon Rachasima, Thailand, and they are doing nothing wrong by participating in summer games. 

Outside hitter Olga Verun of Ukraine and freshman Ines Medved of Croatia helped their teams during the qualifying rounds, but chose to return to FIU to take summer classes. 

Rosa and Valentin traveling overseas to compete against fellow volleyball players, who share the same desire and love for the game while wearing their team's colors is an experience that they should relish. 

Playing for FIU during the season is extremely important, but playing for their home country where they were born, raised and learned volleyball is a rare chance and honor. 

An accolade such as being selected to a world championship tournament is forever ingrained in a player's memory.

 Even though they are at risk of getting hurt in exhibition games that don't benefit their team's 2008 season, the risk of injury is an ever present possibility that shouldn't be the reason for keeping players from accepting an invitation to a tournament. 

Many times athletes become injured while not playing or practicing his or her respective sport. 

Even worse, sometimes athletes are injured playing other sports. So, the argument that players shouldn't represent their respective teams overseas because it renders them vulnerable to injury, is invalid.

In addition, playing volleyball against top tier opponents from different countries with different styles can be used as a form of conditioning for the upcoming season. 

The tournament can serve as a tool to regain regular season form in a quicker fashion.  

Due to the fact that Rosa and Valentin have scholarships courtesy of FIU, some people might believe that they have an obligation to put FIU first when deciding to compete in any competition not involving FIU. 

The university invested time, money and resources on them to play for FIU, and if even just one of them returns unable to play the full season, FIU has lost money in some way or another.

However, often people view athletes as purely investments, and they forget that some players have aspirations that reach beyond fame and fortune. Most players have a genuine love for the sport they have decided to devote so much time and effort to.

The world of sports and money has become so interconnected that athletes willing to play for the pride of their country rather than monetary compensation ought to be encouraged.

Rosa and Valentin will be playing in Thailand and whether they win or lose, they will not regret experiencing playing against the elite players on a big stage wearing their country's colors.

Headline: Commentary: Falcon's QB indicted by grand jury
Author: Adam Wasch / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"Ookie?" The world knows Michael Vick as the elusive Pro-Bowl quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons. In Newport News, Va., where Vick grew up, he is affectionately known as "Ookie," a name bestowed on him by his parents.

According to the federal grand jury indictment filed against Vick on July 17, he was also known as "Ookie" in the dark, shadowy and illegal world of dogfighting.

Vick was indicted on July 17th by a federal grand jury in connection with his alleged involvement in a dogfighting ring located at his property in Smithfield, Va.  

In the pertinent part, the indictment alleges that Vick and his cohorts purchased four pit bulls from a cooperating witness, established a dogfighting business enterprise known as Bad Newz Kennels, and "tested" or "rolled" some of their fighting dogs against other dogs. The terms

"Rolling" or "testing" a fighting dog means placing a dog in a short fighting match to determine how well the animal fights.

Sports Law Blog Contributor Michael McCann, a Professor of Law at Mississippi College, clarifies that an indictment by a federal grand jury is "far from a conviction." 

"Grand jury hearings are typically secret and one-sided in favor of the government," said McCann. "The prosecutor decides which witnesses to call and which witnesses receive immunity. 

The basic questioning is done by the prosecutor, and the defendant doesn't even have a right to have his or her attorney present."

The indictment court file reads like a horror story for animal rights activists and dog lovers everywhere.

The documents state that the pit bulls were to fight to the death. If still alive, the losing dogs were drowned, strangled, hanged, shot or electrocuted to death by a member of the Bad Newz Kennel.  

The country first got word of Vick's connection to pit bull fighting back in April when a police drug raid on a Virginia property owned by Vick uncovered a dogfighting ring, a "rape" stand used to breed fighting dogs, controlled substances used as enhancers in dogfighting and nearly 70 malnourished pit bulls.  

Under Virginia Law, the crime of animal abuse is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and a $2,500 fine. 

However, the federal charge Vick now faces stems from traveling with the illegal fighting dogs to Virginia from other states.

More specifically, Vick faces up to six years in prison and $300,000 for conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture.

The big question is, What happens now? 

The phrase is "innocent until proven guilty." Vick and his lawyers have not yet been given the opportunity to make their case.

Vick is scheduled to appear in federal court to be arraigned on July 26, the first day of Falcons training camp.  

The NFL has no such phrase, and one man serves as the judge, jury and executioner: Commissioner Roger Goodell.  

This summer Goodell passed judgment in the way of suspensions on Adam "Pacman" Jones and Terry "Tank" Johnson.  

Jones, a Tennessee Titans' cornerback, received a season-long suspension for violating the new NFL Personal Conduct Policy. Jones has been arrested five times since he was drafted in 2005. 

The criminal charges include assault, felony vandalism and most recently an incident related to "making it rain" at a Vegas strip club.  

Tank Johnson received an eight-game suspension after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge, resisting arrest and an aggravated assault.  Johnson was released by the Chicago Bears this summer for his continuous legal issues.   

With the National Football League turning into the National Felony League this summer, Goodell has to make a decision using the precedent he set with the Jones and Johnson

The issue is whether he will follow his own precedent in light of Vick being well, Vick.

Will Vick face the same music?

In this sports writer's opinion, the answer is an uncontested YES.  

Under the NFL's new conduct policy, Goodell has the power to discipline "conduct that undermines or puts at risk the integrity" of the league.  

The black eye that these allegations put on the NFL is the exact conduct that the NFL is adamantly trying to prohibit. The moral ineptitude of being even remotely involved in such a grotesque activity should raise a number of red flags.

For repeat violators, Goodell has the power to suspend a player "even when the conduct itself has not yet resulted in a conviction of a crime."  

Vick will argue that he is a first time offender, unlike Jones and Johnson, and should be allowed to play this season.  

However, his hands are not that clean.  

Vick, under the pseudonym "Ron Mexico," was served with a lawsuit that alleged he gave a woman genital herpes. That case was eventually settled out of court. 

Last season, Vick gave the home crowd at the Georgia Dome a double middle-finger salute. Most recently, Vick was stopped at the Miami International Airport with a container smelling of marijuana. Drug tests came up negative.    

Vick, again, has not had the opportunity to defend himself in court. However, the United States government has taken its time to find evidence linking Vick to these charges. 

This is not a case where a maverick District Attorney is flinging around allegations as we saw in the Duke Lacrosse rape case.  Goodell must weigh this into his decision.

The backlash from the indictment has already begun. AirTran and the Boys & Girls Club have pulled their sponsorships. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and the Humane Society plan to make calls to the remaining sponsors, including Rawlings and Powerade, to convince them to do the same.

Let's face it. Allegedly murdering dogs makes you unmarketable, no matter who you are. 

The judicial process can be a lengthy one, and Vick will likely not be hauled into court until after the upcoming NFL season. In the meantime, there is no good reason that Vick should be suiting up for the NFL or endorsing products any time soon.

Headline: No-Limit Texas Hold'em growing in popularity among college students
Author: Darren Collette / Contributing Writer 
&nbsp;
In the midst of one of the biggest events in the history of poker, an FIU student managed to rub shoulders with the pros and beat them at their own game. Senior Andrew Garcia managed to place 14th in the first No-Limit Texas Hold'em Shootout event at the 2008 World Series of Poker.

No-Limit Texas Hold'em is one of the fastest growing poker games in America and has become very popular with college students. 

This summer at the World Series of Poker there were many major poker developments. 

Phil Hellmuth won his 11th World Series of Poker championship bracelet breaking the all-time record held by Doyle Brunson and Johnny Chan. Many celebrities such as Shannon Elizabeth, Tobey Maguire, Jason Alexander, Sully Erna and, the co-producer of the Simpsons, Sam Simon, made it to the cash levels in various tournaments. 

Garcia bought into the Shootout for $1,500 and was one player among 900 entrants. He finished in 14th place. His exit was due to what is known in the poker world as a "bad beat." 

"I had a flush and the guy had a flush draw, and he caught a higher flush," said Garcia. "He had the ace of clubs." 

For his efforts Garcia won $6,757. As for the main event, Garcia decided not to compete and instead opted to pocket the $12,000 prize package he won in a satellite tournament. A satellite tournament is a way a player enters a grand scale tournament.

Historically, poker players have been older, mostly people in age brackets above 30. These older players seem to not give much respect to the younger players who tended to play more aggressively and for money more than enjoyment, as opposed to their generation that played mainly for recreation.

However, since the poker boom of 2003, when Chris Moneymaker won 2.5 million dollars in the World Series of Poker's main event, the popularity of the sport increased. 

It was Moneymaker's first live tournament, and ESPN's coverage of his story helped the Series' main event entry field balloon from 839 entries that year to 2,576 the following year. In 2005, it reached 5,619; last year it reached its peak with a total of 8,773 entries.

On July 1, 2007, Florida made it legal for poker establishments to raise their stakes. Prior to this change the most a player could bet on any hand in a cash game was two dollars, and No Limit Tournaments could be entered for no more than $45. 

One-hundred dollar No Limit cash games were permitted beginning on July 1, and the tournament buy-in roof reached $800. With these changes, it is no longer uncommon for a player to win a $1,000 or more in a day.  

The Flagler Dog Track in Miami, is one of many venues that have benefited from the new laws. They needed to open a new poker room in order to meet the high demand created by the high stakes laws. Vice President Alex Havenick has indicated an interest in encouraging college poker players to participate. 

The current plans include the possibility of a tournament involving University of Miami and FIU students. 

"We think it would get an excellent response, and we are going to start advertising in the middle of August," said Havenick. "We are going to focus on UM and FIU."

There is also a chance that this tournament could add fuel to the UM - FIU rivalry by putting "bounties" on the heads of all the participants. In the poker world, a "bounty" is a term used to refer to what a player can earn by knocking out another player. 

In this case, if a FIU student eliminated a UM student from a tournament, they would get a cash prize and vice versa. Plans for these tournaments will proceed after the state finishes writing the rules governing poker tournaments, and the amounts allowed for jackpots involving bad beats and a royal straight flush. The rules are expected to be written by July 23rd.

The possibility of Division I colleges participating in high stakes poker seem unlikely; however last April, Flagler had a tournament between the UM Med School and its Law School - the Law School won. 

This tournament had approximately 25 to 30 UM students. According to Havenick, this tournament was arranged through UM fraternities and their students.

Poker among college students has been growing steadily. In turn, this could be used as a tool to fuel university rivalries, but only time will tell if UM and FIU will square off in a head-on poker tournament.

Headline: Board of Trustees now complete
Author: Jose Maya / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
With the addition of an FIU alumnus and a Florida government consultant, FIU's Board of Trustees is now complete.

The Florida Board of Governors recently appointed Jorge L. Arrizurieta and Albert Maury to the BOT.

Maury has a deep connection with FIU: he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1996 from the University and a second bachelor's in accounting in 2002. He is also a GOP contributor who oversees the more than 25,000 patient' private health care company.

"I am honored by this government appointment which will enable me to contribute to the continued success of this institution," Maury said. "I hope to help the university better meet the needs of its students by creating memorable and personally relevant courses in all areas of study."

Maury previously served as chief financial officer of Leon Medical Centers and was a member for the Alliance for Aging, gaining broad expertise in health care and finance.

While he didn't obtain his degree from FIU, Arrizurieta is still very familiar with the Florida's public education system: he served on the BOG as an appointee to former Governor Jeb Bush, where he worked to supervise the state's 11 universities and colleges.

"I am honored and humbled by my appointment. I attended [FIU] during the mid '90s and it is clear that this University has skyrocketed to become a significant research facility," Arrizurieta said. 

He also served as president of Florida Free Trade of the Americas and as member of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's Latin American Policy Advisory Group.

"I believe that my previous role on the Board of Governors of the State University System as well as on the Post Secondary Education Commission have prepared me well for this new role at the university level," Arrizurieta said.

Maury and Arrizurieta will work alongside the other 11 members to deal with costs and other policies for FIU, which will have to eliminate some programs to meet the state's four to 10 percent budget cut.

The FIU Board of Trustees has 13 members, five of which are appointed by the Board of Governors, six appointed by the governor, a university faculty chair, and a student body president.

Their responsibilities include managing operations, generating cost-effective policies, maintenaning  high quality education programs, as well as the establishing and abolishing of degree programs and course offerings. 

The board can perform without recommendations from the president and provides rules abided by the Board of Governors.

Arrizurieta and Maury join a distinguished board of trustees that includes a retired public school principal, five former CEO's and a senior regional vice president of Univision Radio.

The full board is set to have its  next meeting July 25 via conference call.

Trespassing

A man was issued a trespassing warning after his ex-girlfriend, an FIU student, called campus police because he barricaded her in the Blue Garage. He wouldn't let her leave the garage and threatened to let the air out of her tires if she wouldn't speak to him. Police confronted the man, who agreed to leave. 



Suspicious Activity

A student alerted campus police that a man in the computer room of the library was acting suspiciously. The man, who was not an FIU student, was looking at pornographic web sites and masturbating. Officers approached the man, and observed him looking at nude females. The officer asked him to close the window of the site and arrested him outside. A records check of the suspect revealed a bench warrant for petty theft and the man was taken to the Miami-Dade County Main Jail to await prosecution.
