Headline: WRGP waits for translators
Author: Nicole Acosta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For Radiate FM (WRGP), hopes are high for bringing in a wider audience. 

New FM translators are being installed and by the Spring 2006 semester, FIU students will finally hear their student-run radio station on campus. 

Brennan Forsyth, student and general manager of the Radiate FM, said the hardest part is yet to come, and that is actually getting students to listen.

"We want to be able to give them music they will enjoy and news they're interested in, but we want to give them music they haven't heard before and won't hear about on any of the big radio stations," he said. 

Forsyth explained that installing the FM translators would take their radio frequency and re-broadcast it on another frequency. 

Not only will the radio station be heard on WRGP 88.1 FM, it will also be heard on 99.3 FM as of the end of the next semester. 

Forsyth said these translators were necessary because the 88.1 FM station has a low amount of power (165 watts). 

Radiate FM cannot be heard on campus. In fact, it can only be heard on a car radio. 

The station relies heavily on word of mouth and WRGP.org to draw in listeners. 

Another setback for the station is that it receives interference from WAY-FM 88.1, a Christian music station.

With the new translators "we can broadcast with a higher level of clarity within 12 miles," Forsyth said. 

"The presence of this radio station is going to be heavy. You're going to be hearing more of us."

In addition to the new translators, steps are also being taken to expose the station to a larger audience via its website, WRGP.org, and to start a recruitment drive for DJs. 

Forsyth also mentions that Radiate FM will be updating its website with more frequency.

The revamped site will contain DJ bios, a message board and blogs that will be updated regularly.

In an effort to expand its DJ roster, the station will also hold a recruitment drive at Graham Center  this semester. 

The station, which currently has 30 DJs in rotation, is looking to expand its roster by taking on anyone who has a passion for music.

Graduate student Hikmat Kilzi, known on the air as DrasticX, has been a DJ on Radiate FM for four years, and hosts his own Hip-Hop show every Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. called "It'z All Gravy." 

Over the last year, his weekly guests have included Pitbull, Mike Jones and Akon, as well as many other underground and independent artists. 

"I try to feature music that is not played on commercial radio, but is enjoyable to the listeners. People know when they tune in to my show, they'll hear stuff they usually don't hear." 

News director Jackie Diaz hosts "News Talk," which airs every Saturday from 8 to 10 a.m. 

Every week, there is a new guest on the show who has affected FIU. 

Her most recent speaker was Christian Jarquin, coordinator of Nicaragua December of Dreams, a group that provides toys, shoes, clothing and school supplies to the children of Nicaragua.

"I try to get the school more involved, or at least informed, as much as possible about organizations, clubs or events that students aren't aware of," Diaz said.

Diaz hopes the increase in exposure will give her the audience she desires.

Forsyth does not credit himself as the pioneer of this project, which has been in the making for 10 years.

"It's important to understand that the whole process didn't start or end with me," he said. 

"I came at the tail end of the project and put the final pieces together."

Forsyth, however, is still apprehensive about how the station will be received.

"I certainly see a huge increase in popularity, but that depends if we're giving FIU something they want to hear," he said. 

"The hardest goal is to give people something they will enjoy. In the end, this is a student radio station."

Headline: Clinic offers health care options for students
Author: Fallan M. Thompson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With flu season at its peak from October to May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention students should be thinking about their health care options. 

FIU offers the opportunity for students to take advantage of the health care center at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Â The health care center offers a variety of services covered by the $54 student health fee students pay for each semester. 

These services include physical examinations, medical consultations, routine care for illnesses and injuries, health education and health screening for various conditions concerning vision and hearing. 

"I think the fee is worth it. You might as well take advantage of it and take care of yourself because your health is the most important thing," said Kristy Johnson, a freshman majoring in pre-law.

However, the student health fee does not cover other medical expenses that the centers offer for a fee. 

These services include laboratory tests such as strep screening, chemistries, blood count, mono test, cholesterol, urinalysis, and pregnancy tests among others.

 EKG testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, respiratory therapy, HIV Antibody testing and counseling, pap smears, prescription and over-the-counter medications  are also offered. 

Also offered at the health center are formulary Immunizations for measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis, influenza, tetanus screening for a fee. 

For example,  a PAP smear at a regular doctor's office will cost someone $50 to $75,  according to BBC health center director Elvia Velez. 

However, at the health center, PAP smears are $19 and students are not charged per visit. 

There is a gynecologist who practices once a week at UP's health clinic.

 The GYN follows up on PAP smears that the lab determines abnormal. 

The number of abnormal PAP smears have risen at an alarming rate and caused the health clinic to raise awareness for students. 

Jan. 24, 25 and 26 will be dedicated to educate students about cervical cancer and genital warts. 

The center doesn't offer services such as X-rays and other sophisticated diagnostic testing. 

Specialty physician care such as obstetrics, surgery, ophthalmology, cardiology, gastroenterology and dental care among others. 

Emergency care during after clinic hours and overnight infirmary services are also not offered at the clinic.  

"With 36,000 students at FIU and less than 300 living at BBC dorms, it would be too costly to have the center available 24 hours a day," Velez said. "It's not cost effective, and it's not fair to charge students for something that would be rarely used." 

The health center at BBC has a small pharmacy, with a full pharmacy at UP, that carries many medications needed for common illnesses, at a much lower cost. Also available at the pharmacy are birth control pills, the birth control ring and the birth control patch. 

The pill is offered for $12 and the ring for $10 a month.

"The health care centers offer a good service but we need a larger facility to cater to the demand of the students. In order to get the additional 3,000 square feet we want, we need the student's support," Velez said. 

FIU offers insurance plans for graduate, international and domestic students to help pay for the extra medical expenses not covered by the $54 student health fee and not offered at the clinics. 

The domestic insurance plan is offered to all students attending FIU who are United States citizens and not already covered by another plan, such as students still on their parents' health insurance. 

The plan costs $1,291 for the entire year and covers prescriptions and lab services up to the policy limitations when used at the student health services. 

Maximum benefits up to $100,000 are offered to students and $50,000 for their dependents. 

All students enrolled in a minimum of six credit hours at FIU are eligible to participate in this program. Graduate students are eligible without the minimum credit hours. 

Access to the student health centers is limited to students paying the student health fee but that are not on an FIU insurance plan. 

Spouses and dependents who are not students are ineligible to use the student health centers and will not receive reduced deductibles for their insurance claims.

The international student health insurance plan costs $1,444 per year and can also include dependents. 

This plan is similar to the domestic student plan but caters to the international students needs while they attend FIU. 

This plan also covers prescriptions and all health care provided by off campus physicians. 

"A lot of students are without insurance and the student health fee is less than at other [public Florida] schools like University of Florida," Velez said.

Immunizations are also offered at the health clinic. 

The immunizations offered include the mandatory shots required for students to attend FIU.

The healthcare centers at both BBC and UP campuses are offering flu shots to students and faculty. 

Students are required to pay $12 per flu shot while staff members are charged $16. 

BBC began offering shots Nov. 7 by appointment only. 

UP is offering shots on a first come, first served basis certain days of the semester. 

For additional information contact the health care clinic at (305) 348-240.

Headline: MLK Celebration 2006
Subheadline: FIU to partake in series of events
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Both University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campus will commence the Spring semester with an annual celebration of the life of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. It is a commemorative event now entering its 15th year.

The occasion is mainly sponsored by the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services but has cooperation from each campus's student governments, along with help from the African New World Studies program and the Student Programming Council.

"We're very happy so much work has been put into an event that carries so much significance," said Dorret Sawyers, director for the OMPS at BBC. "With what is happening in the world, it's important to inspire the youth in our community to search for peace and understanding, and these events will be the perfect way to work together and bring this message to light."

The week-long celebration will officially begin Jan. 10 with the MLK Youth Forum at the Wolfe University Center at BBC at 9 a.m. This forum will include a speech on this year's theme, A Call to Conscience, by Tonea Stewart, an Alabama State University professor and actress who has appeared in movies like Mississippi Burning and in the TV series "In the Heat of the Night."

The discussion panel will be followed by a peace walk at noon around BBC, though organizers state that due to the current construction, the parade will probably take place along the School of Hospitality and Management building, then down to the bay.

Around 300 to 400 students are expected to attend, though most of these will be from Miami-Dade and Broward County middle schools and high schools.

"The event has never made a big impact on FIU students, so most of those attending will be brought from other schools. We'd love to see home students, faculty and staff attend, though, since this is something opened to everyone," Sawyers said.

The Black Student Union  will host a dinner that same day in UP's Graham Center Ballroom at 8 p.m., followed on Jan. 11 by a presentation and discussion of the movie A Long Walk Home in GC 243 at 7:30 p.m.

The MLK Commemorative Breakfast will take place on Jan 13, also in the GC Ballrooms, at 8 a.m. The guest speaker will be U.S. Congressman Kweisi Mfume, a former CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and current contender for Maryland's senate chair.

"We've had a varied list of speakers over the years who bring different perspectives and themes to our discussions," Sawyers said. "This year will be no different, so we hope the university community enjoys what they will present."

Tickets for the MLK Breakfast are $35 and can be attained through the OMPS. 

Any questions regarding further events should be addressed to this office at (305)348-2436.

Headline: Sports photographer remembered for dedication 
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Geoff Anderson, the man behind the lens at most university sporting events, died Jan. 3 doing what he loved - taking photos. He was 55.

Anderson suffered a stroke within a few hours of the start of the Orange Bowl game between Florida State and Penn State held at Dolphins Stadium. He was there to shoot photos of the game.

For over 30 years, Anderson established himself as a quality and dedicated photographer who never let his bosses down. 

In Florida, Anderson captured sporting stills at the University of Miami, Lynn University and FIU, where he spent his last ten years.

"He was completely dedicated to FIU," said Anderson's son and sophomore at FIU, Geoffrey Anderson Jr. "FIU was his second home. Even when the team would lose, he would be at all their games. He would always leave the house wearing FIU clothing."

Anderson was a volunteer photographer for the university athletic department and The Beacon. 

"He meant so much to us," said Rich Kelch, assistant athletic director of media relations. "Regardless of the team or the record, he was there and paid his own way. He went to many road games and was always my roommate. He was a great human being."

Anderson was the biggest fan of university players.

"Geoff meant a lot to the university because he was really someone who cared about the kids," Athletic Director Rick Mello said. "He professionalized our operation on having great photos. He captured the first four years of history of our football program. His work is something we won't ever be able to repay."

Despite dedicating time to attend most FIU home games, Anderson was always there for his family. 

"Even though he was at every game, he never let work get in the way of family,"  Anderson Jr. said. "He always took great care of my mom and I."

Geoff Anderson was born July 20, 1950 and was raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. 

He earned a bachelor's degree in Spanish from Washington College, where he also served as the editor in chief of the university paper. 

Aside from taking photos at FIU, Anderson was co-owner of an ASAP mailing service company and did freelance photography for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, The Miami Herald and Entertainment News and Views.

"He was an overall caring person. So many people [have called] me to tell me the impact he had in many peoples lives," Anderson Jr. said. "So many people call giving me stories on how he had a played a major role in their lives."

"I just found out that radio station WQAM had a 10-minute piece on him. In less than half an hour, we received over 70 calls. He would just help out anyone."

Before the start of both the women's and men's basketball game Jan. 5, the athletic department honored Anderson with a moment of silence.

"He meant so much to the FIU community," said Will Sanchez, WRGP sports play-by-play announcer, who also honored Anderson over the air during the pre-game show. 

"It was weird not having him there at all the last game."

In addition to son Anderson Jr., Geoff Anderson is survived by wife Diane Anderson.

A memorial service took play Jan.7 at the Poinciana United Methodist Church in Miami Springs.

Headline: Professors indicted for espionage
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
By Ana Sanchez
News Editor

Two FIU professors who are married were indicted as covert agents of the Cuban government and arrested by FBI agents Jan. 6 for failure to register with the federal government as foreign agents. 

Carlos Alvarez, associate professor for the educational leadership and policy studies, and wife Elsa Alvarez, counselor for the psychological services department are being detained at the Miami Federal Detention Center.

After a two hour court hearing Jan. 9, U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrea Simonton denied them bond, siding with the federal prosecuter's argument that the couple might make contact with Cuban government officials which might make them a flight risk. University President Modesto A. Maidique attended the hearing.

"He went to the court not as the president but he appeared there as a friend of the Alvarez's specifically to address to the issue about whether they present a flight risk and say that he did not believe that they were," said director of media relations Mark Riordan.

"The president and professor Alvarez are close, personal friends and their relationship dates back to 25 years, before the president even worked at the university," Riordan said.
Students and faculty were surprised to hear the news, including, special education major student, Nicole Herrea who had Professor Alvarez for a cultural and diversity class.

"He was the sweetest - so helpful, I would have never in my life thought that [this would happen]. I was in complete shock. I knew that he was Cuban, he had a thick accent and he spoke about people's culture in general but he never voiced his opinions on politics," Herrea said.

Associate professor for the department of educational foundations and professional studies, M. O. Thirunarayanan agreed. 

"He was always smiling, I would see him in the hall way and we would say hello - I never expected anything like this, he was very friendly and a nice colleague,"  Thirunarayanan said. 

The couple admitted to their relationship with the Cuban government to the FBI in June 2005. 

According to prosecutor and Assistant U.S. Attorney, Brian Frazier, the Alvarez's provided Cuban government officials information about U.S. political situation and information about well-known Cuban-Americans in South Florida. They also allegedly gave away the identity of an FIU student who was an FBI agent. 

Frazier went on to say that the methods the couples used to communicate with Cuba included shortwave radio, a five-digit code, encrypted computer disks and traveling to Cuba carrying messages using their academic positions as a cover. 

The Alvarez's could be facing seven to ten years in prison if convicted for not registering as foreign agents and an arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 19.

There is speculation that Carlos Alvarez recruited FIU students for espionage for the Cuban government but at the time of print, the University Media Relations department had yet to confirm whether or not Alvarez had traveled to Cuba with FIU students within the university study abroad program or whether he had recruited students. 

The Alvarez's are on administrative leave with pay as per univeristy policy.

Maidique was unavailable for comment at the time of press.

Headline: Linton appointed new SGA president
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
The new year is already bringing changes to the Biscayne Bay Campus and among them is a new Student Government Association president. 

Natkisha Jean-Baptiste, the former president of SGA, announced she was stepping down as president in early December. Lemar Linton, the former vice president, has taken her place for the remainder of the term which concludes at the end of May. 

Although Linton, who will be graduating this Spring, has yet to decide whether he will run for next year's term as a graduate student, he has already proposed new ideas to improve BBC.

"I'd like to start a publication called 'Who's Who,' which will highlight star students at BBC," Linton said.

He also plans to coordinate a student award ceremony to encourage student envolvement on campus.

"It will be an awards ceremony based on academic merit ... We're going to ask professors who their best students are ... We hope that it will show students that SGA cares about them and wants them to get involved," he said.

He is also looking for a new vice president and will announce his decision on Wednesday.

"I'm in the process of interviewing ... There's four individuals who've expressed interest. I'm asking them what their agendas would be if they were in the position. I need someone committed and dedicated ... someone who exemplifies good leadership qualities," he said.

Those who have worked closely with Linton are enthusiastic about the Spring semester.

"I think that Lemar will be an excellent president this semester. He's demonstrated his leadership skills as a peer advisor, and I think he'll do great things," said Craig Cunningham, director of Campus Life.

"I've always seen a positive change, but now I see advancement," said Rogell Levers, a peer advisor for Campus Life.

Jean-Baptiste is traveling to Los Angeles, Ca. as part of the Student Exchange program to earn experience as a TV production student.

"I'm going to miss SGA and all of the exciting things that are going to happen next semester, but he's going to do an excellent job," Jean-Baptiste said.

Linton is also enthusiastic about the next semester and his chance at the presidency. 

"I will miss Natkisha, she was my partner, but I'm  glad about the opportunity," Linton said.

Headline: Eavesdropped
Subheadline: Misleading newspaper headline deceives public
Author: Christopher necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
When the New York Times published an article accusing the Bush administration of spying on American citizens without a warrant, the feeding frenzy began. Democrats and liberals everywhere were shocked, flabbergasted by the thought of a rogue government secretly delving into the lives of average, everyday Americans. As was expected, shortly after the publication of the article in question, comparisons to George Orwell's classic novel, "1984," abounded.  

The Bush administration suddenly became the Big Brother that we were taught to fear in high school.  There was talk of laws being broken, the Constitution being defiled, and, of course, what would a good ole fashioned political controversy be without those inevitable talks of impeachment.

Nobody, myself included, wants the government listening in on their personal conversations. I certainly don't want President Bush being briefed on my latest personal screw up.  Funny as it sounds, this is exactly what the Times' article was implying.  

When you see a headline which reads "Bush lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Warrants," as was the Times' headline, what is the first thing that comes to your mind?  If you're like me, what has started scrolling on the news tickers in the Times Square in your head reads something like "This is an absolute outrage!" 

However, what if the headline was different?  What if the headline sounded more like "Bush Authorizes the National Security Agency (NSA) to Eavesdrop on Suspected Terrorists"? If this were the case, as it was in some publications, the only thing going through my head would be two words: common sense.

If the events of September 11, 2001, taught us anything, it was that there are people out there who want us dead.  You can debate all day about why they want us dead, but the bottom line is that they do indeed yearn to shed American blood in any way possible. 

America had to learn the hard way that it was not invincible. It took the death of 3,000 plus people for us to realize that the enemy was at the gates, and in some cases, had already penetrated our "impenetrable" barriers, bypassed our securities and used our very own civil liberties against us.  

In October 2003, Iyman Ferris confessed to working with al-Qaida on a plot that would have destroyed the Brooklyn Bridge, killing thousands of Americans. Perhaps those lives were spared because NSA agents thought Ferris might be up to something and decided to tap his phone. Ferris is now preparing to sue President Bush for illegally wiretapping him.  

Am I the only one who finds this absurd? Only in America can you actually sue the government for preventing you from killing thousands of its citizens.

Yet, opponents of this measure persist. At the root of their debate is the infamous 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which requires a warrant from a special court, known quite simply as the FISA court, before a wiretap can be placed on an American citizen.  

As comfortable as it is to know that the government cannot have my opinion on the latest episode of the "OC" without a court warrant, getting warrants on a moment's notice to eavesdrop on terrorism suspects who may divulge critical information at any given moment seems downright unfeasible and unlikely.

The FISA court is hardly seen as an obstacle, and is an unnecessary formality. Even the Times classified the FISA court as a "rubber stamp," due to its reputation of never declining an application for a warrant.  

The numbers paint a slightly different story, however. In the 20 years leading up to the events of 9/11, the FISA courts never once modified or declined a petition for a warrant. After 9/11, however, the courts modified 179 of the 5,645 warrant requests presented by the Bush administration and completely declined six warrant requests within the last two years.

If I have yet to convince you and you are a die hard Bush-basher, then I will deal the final blow.  This so-called "warrantless spying" is by no means unprecedented. During the administration of the very president who signed the FISA, Jimmy Carter, this surveillance was going on.  President Carter authorized the warrantless searches of two men suspected of spying for the Vietnamese government.   

More recently, in a 1994 testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Clinton Administration Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick stated that "The Department of Justice believes -- and the case law supports -- that the president has inherent authority to conduct warrantless physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes â¦ " She later added that this authority also concerned electronic surveillance.

As a society we need to reexamine the balance between personal freedoms and the greater good.  We are at a time in our nation's history where it is sometimes necessary to forfeit some freedoms to maintain the order in society. Until the threat is neutralized, we must do what is necessary to protect the innocent from people who mercilessly aim to hurt them.

Subheadline: Translators to benefit students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
WRGP has come a long way from when it started in 1986 and now the radio station is closer than ever to being heard on campus within a 12-mile radius. The station is close to receiving the translators needed for further expansion.

The FIU community will benefit strongly when the station receives the translators to air at the University Park campus. Not only will students be able to listen to music not heard on commercial stations, but also news, including much needed traffic updates.

This is going to be a major step for FIU, especially if we want to compete with the likeness of other local universities including the University of Miami, which has a growing radio station of its own, heard throughout Miami. 

It is imperative that students listen to the station in order for it to stick around and be a success. Money and time has been invested in order to add the translators.

Parking updates will be one of the neat things the station will offer. When students are on their way to the university, they will know what garages or parking lots are less crowded in order to find a quick parking spot and make it to class on time.

With the addition of a variety of diverse DJs, the station will be able to reach a larger audience by means of expanding the music they play. FIU is made up of many students with different music tastes. By offering a larger variety of music, more people will be inclined to turn to Radiate 88.1 or even the new 99.3 FM.

We are happy to know that once the translators are up and running at UP, the station will focus on having a signal at the Biscayne Bay Campus. Even though it will be bothersome to switch frequencies when a student travels from UP to BBC, being able to listen to a show nonstop is impressive.

Headline: Homeless do not live up to stereotypical image
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
There are people who walk around cities at night like zombies, ambling between skyscrapers and through public parks during sleepless hours because they have nothing else to do, nowhere else to be.

People call them the homeless, although they themselves don't use this term - it's not that they find it offensive, just that they think it's inaccurate. Most of them say they're "temporarily down" or "just looking for a place," stuck in a forced doldrums over which they can't seem to escape.

I found this out over the winter break while volunteering at a Baptist-run shelter in Hallandale. I'll admit I partially did this because a good friend of mine was doing it, but also because of a Christmas-time guilt in which I felt I should be sharing goodwill towards men or decking halls or something instead of sitting at home while drooling over neatly wrapped gifts.

So I went to church with a group of younger teens (some doing it because their parents made them, others joining friends, and a few because "it sounded like a cool thing to do") and waited for the poor to come.

Now, the image of homeless shelters I'd always envisioned came from movies and TVs where the plots of many Christmas specials involved middle class kids unwillingly made to serve soup to the poor until they find a bum with a heart of gold who teaches them the true meaning of the holidays â¦ and then dies.

I was ready for that, ready to serve food and smile while meeting a likeable street urchin who would share the secrets of the gritty underworld life with me. So I sat among the hungry crowd while they picked up their dinners and waited for the wisdom to flow.

The first guy I talked to was Jerry, a chubby Pennsylvanian with a thin lisp who seemed like he'd been waiting an eternity to have someone to talk to. 

He told me about his days as a radio DJ, when all he liked playing were Beatles and Led Zeppelin singles, and about adventures he'd had during the twenty years he's been living in South Florida. 

The conversation seemed normal enough, though he did tend to twitch and look uncomfortably away when I said something about my own life. Then came the discussion on how his wife and children tried to poison him some years ago and how his parents belonged to a sect that worshipped Jesus on Sunday but performed satanic sacrifices the rest of the week.

He talked and talked and would fidget if it seemed like I would leave, asking me if I'd return every time I got up. I eventually went to help my friend distribute the dessert and when I returned to the table, he had gone without saying goodbye to anyone.

I shrugged this off and went to make conversation with the other diners. There was an 83-year-old woman who would turn 84 on New Year's Day but laughed as she said she'd have no one to celebrate it with; the couple who wore torn shirts with the confederate flag on them and carried a tiny, 10-month-old girl named Savannah Ruth; the skinny old man hidden behind a Dolphins jacket so huge it looked like a parka; and the two men with missing teeth who smoked and cursed outside the shelter but constantly reminded each other they shouldn't be doing those things, since they were in church.

"All the earth is the Lord's place, boy, so don't you be doing none of what we're doing or you'll end up in Hell where the pain's forever and ever and boy, you don't want that kind of pain," one of them told me, a lanky man who looked like Sherman Hemsley from "The Jeffersons."

We gave them all presents, a shirt and socks wrapped in pretty paper, and wished them happy holidays as they strolled away from the church and into the night.

Watching them disappear into the shadows of buildings, I realized that I hadn't learned anything of use from any of them. Even before we started feeding them I knew the chances of meeting one of those guys they show on TV would be slim after the pastor advised the girls in the group to stick together and not wander alone. Warnings like this would never be needed around people with hearts of gold.

If anything, it's possible to say that the people I fed that night regarded themselves as equally neurotic and troubled as those who were doing the feeding, except they had no van to take them safely back home when the meal was done. They were normal folk who cared about living til the end of the day and nothing more.

I also noticed that many of them talked and laughed and shared stories while sitting next to each other but come time to leave, they barely said goodbye and walked their separate ways, stumbling through the cold streets towards whatever shelter they could find by themselves.

Too often we tend to paint the poor either as saints in rags or punished sinners because we like to make stories out of worlds we don't know or understand. But those figures walking like the living dead into the night weren't saints or sinners. 

They were people who could feel loneliness as great or low as anybody else with a house or car and didn't seem to care that they were "temporarily down" because things would eventually go up.

They were people, just colder and hungrier then the rest of us, and bored because there's nothing for them to do, no place to go to.

Subheadline: Men lose eight straight games over break
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Jan. 5 loss to Arkansas-Little Rock marked the eighth straight loss for the  men's basketball team and, by all means, marked no improvement for a team that is just 3-10 to start the season. 

The remaining 14 games before the conference tournament are considered by coaches and players as the second season, the one that counts; yet judging by its start against UALR, it is looking to be much like the 'first' season dating from November to December 2005. 

FIU's lackluster performance at Pharmed Arena left much to be desired from a team that came into the season as the coach's pick to finish in second in the Sun Belt East Division. 

Though the Golden Panthers managed to force their opponents to just 30 percent shooting, they fell 55-53 in the conference opener when Trojan forward Lekheythan Malone, 2-of-9 from the field all night, was left wide open with 11 seconds to play. The Golden Panthers managed to get the ball in the visitor's zone and called timeout. 

What happened next can be looked at as the FIU season so far, in a nutshell. 

Elvis Lora, the freshman guard from Bronx, NY who led the team in scoring with 17 points on the night, took the inbound pass and let the clock slip to less than 1.2 seconds before firing off a half-hearted attempt at the basket. 

The crowd was stunned, some even yelling at the lack of gusto showed by a team that could have easily won the bout by 20 points. 

Though many factors go into losing a game, for the Golden Panthers it's as though the same things are costing them night in and night out. 

Though it would be easy to give a list of the negative things this team has done over the eight-game freefall, the best answers are found in their last performance. 

Against Arkansas-Little Rock, FIU was out-rebounded (37-34 overall; 16-7 offensively), gave away more turnovers (23-15), had only 23 points from their starting five (the other 30 coming off the bench) and, most importantly, were held without a field goal over the last 6:50 of the game (yes, six minutes and fifty seconds!). 

How any team expects to win a game with a stat line like that befuddles me. 

The worst thing however, for a young team in a situation in which it is searching for an identity much like this Golden Panther team is, was revealed quickly in this match-up.

Though not too many were willing to say it out loud, only one man stood up after the defeat and admitted it publicly.  

Senior guard Jayce Lewis, while a guest on the WRGP 88.1 FM post-game show, clearly stated that the reason for this team's misfortunes this season can be attributed directly to a "lack of heart". 

Unfortunately, I would have to agree with him. 

This team could have easily walked off the court with a win on Jan. 5 and also on back-to-back nights during the Holiday Tournament in which they finished dead last. Having won it last year, if for 10 minutes they'd have played with some desire, some want to; some things as Lewis pointed out, "cannot be taught, you have to have it inside you." 

Let's be honest, no one realistically expected them to beat George Washington and Michigan State on the road. Notre Dame was even a long shot; but losses to LaSalle, St. Bonaventure, Cal State-Fullerton, DePaul and Arkansas-Little Rock? Those were games FIU could have won. No doubt in my mind and the team's if you ask them.

For this team to have success, great strides have to be made. We have seen what a turnaround a team led by coach Sergio Rouco can do. Last season was the clear cut example: a sub-par season that included a seven-game losing streak but a flash of brilliance in the playoffs which led to a semi-finals birth.  

The difference then was that the team wanted it. 

Led by seniors Junior Matias and Byron Burnett, knowing it was their last gasp as collegiate athletes, and fantastic juniors Ivan Almonte and Ismael N'Diaye, this team came alive and flourished. Flourished so much that with only five returning players they were still picked to finish second.

What happened to that team? 

Well, many fingers can be pointed. 

The lack of desire and heart can be one area that needs work, but the other, consistency, may well be just as important. 

The Golden Panthers rely on a double-double every night from Almonte. He knows that and does his best. Teams which face FIU however, know what he can do, so he draws double teams nightly, which limits what he can do. 

Johwen Villegas has shown moments of brilliance this season. He poured in 24 points on eight threes in the loss to DePaul on New Year's eve. Without Almonte, Fuller or Lewis in the lineup, FIU lost by 12. 

In the two point loss to UALR he was just 1-of-6 shooting for three points, a non-factor. 

Elvis Lora has shown moments of brilliance as well, with his three point shot at the end of regulation against USF, which forced overtime and his 17-point, second half performance against DePaul, but he too has shown signs of inconsistency. 

Despite leading the team with 17 critical points against UALR he managed to throw the game away with his brain blunder with 1.2 seconds left. 

The list can go on and on. 

N'Diaye has been a non-factor in most games this year. A star on last year's team, he averaged well into double figures in scoring.  This year, he is averaging just six points a game and is yet to find his feet in any contest.

The team constantly throws the ball away offensively, whether it's a bad pass or a bad shot or who knows what. 

We've seen it all this year. Alan Guyton's sixth turnover against UALR was for a five-second violation with 22 seconds left in the game and FIU up by 1. It led to the game winning shot on the other end. 

With all that has gone on, the good thing is that there is still time for this team to find it's feet and reach the place they and their fans expect them to be. As Guyton said following the Holiday Tournament, "We want to win the Sun Belt." 

If that is the case, I will be the one rooting the hardest for this team to be successful. But for that to happen they have to get it done. After all, the fans aren't allowed on the court - not until they win the championship that is.

For that to be the case, come March 7 in Murfreesboro, this team needs to find that desire and heart to drive them and the consistency it takes to win games every night.

Headline: Coach Russo prepares for tough second half of season
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The women's basketball team faced their first Sun-Belt Conference foe Jan. 5 at Pharmed Arena. Thanks to a game-high 15 points and four assists by senior point guard Faeza Bouderra, the lady ballers romped the winless Arkansas Little-Rock Trojans 60-45.  

The win advanced the Golden Panthers to an 8-5 record that puts them in sole possession of second place in the East Division of the Sun Belt. Standing two games back from first-place Western Kentucky, the women's basketball team will get set to play 13 of their last 15 regular season games versus opponents of the Sun-Belt Conference.

Before tensions began to mount and the Golden Panthers got set for a heated second half to the 2005-2006 season, The Beacon sat down with head coach Cindy Russo to talk about the successful first half of the season  and the difficult second half that lies ahead.

Lasma Jekabsone is averaging nearly 15 points, 10 rebounds and is shooting just about 50 percent from the field. Wasn't an inside presence the big question mark this season?

There's no other way to put it. She's just stepped up in every area [of the game]. She's a scorer, she's a great rebounder and she's a tough player.  She's really come up big for this ball club at a time we needed it most.

Faeza Bouderra is putting up solid numbers, but she's turned the ball over 68 times. What's going on?

Every time you're in an offense, that pushes the ball a lot, there's going to be a lot of turnovers. I think that as time goes on she gets better, she settles down. That's what she's done her entire college career.

How much of it has to do with her increased role in the offense and the burdens she needs to carry?

Faeza is not the kind of player who worries about numbers or anything like that. She'll do anything she has to do. I think sometimes she gets a little bit over-anxious and I think sometimes she doesn't have a supporting cast out there to make it easier on her.

You have a tough road ahead of you; what players need to step up as you make your way to the second half of the season?

Everybody always has to step up because we're a team. But we definitely need Eva Makela to step up, we need to have [Iva] Ciglar come in and produce, LaQuetta Ferguson â¦ we have a lot of players who need to step up that I don't think have done that as of yet.

Who's surprised you this year?

They haven't really been a surprise, but my two freshman, Marquita Adley and Iva Ciglar, have done a nice job.

The two biggest games this season, versus the University of Miami and Kansas, have resulted in big-time losses. What does this mean for your young team and how they will fare in the big Conference games coming up?

We'll see, there's a big one coming up Saturday night [versus Arkansas-State]. I think they've played fairly well against good teams. We've been on the road and we've kept our composure and played to our talent. We just need to stay within ourselves and I think we'll be fine.

What are some things your team has struggled with this season?

Turnovers are a big one â¦ and just continuity on the floor.  Getting to know each other, knowing where our shooters are and playing as a team.

What separates this year's team from those in the past? That makes you think this one will win a Conference Title?

I think this group gets along very well, they're very energetic on the court, they crash the boards really well; and we have a little bit deeper of a bench than we've had in the past. It all just seems right.

Headline: Critic's new work tackles Judeo-Chrisitan themes 
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Since Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" stormed the publishing world in 2003, booksellers have been eager to capitalize on the growing demand for tomes dealing with religious matters, particularly religious controversies. 

Recently joining this list of spiritually oriented best-sellers is the latest work of Yale professor and literary critic Harold Bloom, whose many readings of important Judeo-Christian writings have led him to explore delicate themes in "Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine."

In his latest foray into controversy, Bloom tries to show the disparity between the Jesus worshipped by American Christians and the Jesus of the Bible, whom he tends to regard as a great literary character on par with Shakespeare's moody Hamlet. Bloom contends that this "novel character" may have been a purposeful imitation of Yahweh, the Hebrew name for the god of the Jewish Bible and Christian Old Testament.

Bloom's conclusion comes from the fact that the man portrayed in certain sections of the New Testament (specifically the Gospel of Mark) shares such traits in common with Yahweh as unpredictability, anger, passion and irony, while both the Jesus Christ and God depicted these days are docile, vague and unreachable.

Though most of the theories in the book are meant to show that the writings of the New Testament are bane imitations of what Bloom sees as the more elevated Tanakh (Old Testament), he tries his best to not sound too derogatory toward the Christian faith, referring at times to Jesus as "a Jewish genius."

The book's main problem is not in the controversies it tries to stir, but rather in its writing style.

Much like Bloom's last critical work, 2004's "Where Shall Wisdom be Found?," this new book suffers from his rambling, almost stream-of-consciousness style where sentences verge off topic and paragraphs quickly lose meaning. Admittedly, "Wisdom" was written after Bloom's long hospitalization as a personal search for meaning in the classics he loved. But "Jesus and Yahweh" is meant to be read as a scholarly piece, so many of his declarations and insertions just distract from the main ideas.

Another problem is the author's famed taste for adding literary allusions in the unlikeliest of places. Yes, many readers know that Bloom has boasted he can read 1,000 pages in an hour - this does not mean we have to hear how much he enjoys Proust over Freud at every turn, or how much Shakespeare encompasses all the talent and wisdom of the Western world. Bloom's read a lot - we get it - now we hope he'll eventually get to the point.

Though the book manages to convey many interesting and novel ideas (such as a section where Bloom claims that religion is not, as Marx states, the opiate of nations, but rather their "poetry, both good and bad"), the style weighs it down and prohibits the reader from fully enjoying some of the best parts. For those interested in the critic's religious writings, it would be better to start off with earlier, better-written and more controversial works like "The American Religion" and "The Book of J," which proposed that portions of the first five books of the Bible were actually written by a woman, an idea that would make Dan Brown proud.

Subheadline: Getting the most out of Miami's two-week winter
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There are two things I love about the holiday season in Miami: being together with my judgmental and overbearing family, and finally being able to rock a scarf.

Okay, so there's not very much I like about winter in Miami, but there's a lot more to the winter season than just throwing a piece of fabric around your throat and wanting to hang yourself.  Sure, it's an ugly topic, fashion that is, but you don't want to be caught looking like you were expecting a blizzard in the Graham Center at University Park.  

As the humidity of the swampland lifts from the landscape, now is really the only time to capitalize on wearing that delightful hat you bought, but never got to wear. Try something funky and new for a change.

"I love wearing hats, so it's my only small opportunity to wear a lot of the cute beanies that have been accumulating in my closet since I was 14," said junior Lauren Rodriguez. "I like to take advantage of the winter as an excuse to dress up a bit more, like wearing a turtle neck with nice pants, rather than the same boring tank top and jeans to go out." 

But girls, don't lose touch with reality - sure it can be fun to try on a bunch of outfits you wouldn't dare to wear in the peak of summer - but remember that we are still in swamp weather. A thick heavy wool parka, for example, serves no purpose in Miami; remember that it's never that cold around these parts.

The Gap and Old Navy do a great job of offering a variety of funky, vibrant scarves which won't put a dent in your wallet, as well as smart, nice fitting blazers or fashionable biker jackets which are really "in" right now.  

Hit up some shops like Urban Outfitters or Armani Exchange; they usually have the most unique arsenal of jackets and blazers to pick from. Wear it over any of your vintage shirts then put on your Lucky jeans and suddenly you're dressed for winter with little effort.  

Track jackets have also been a hit across the board this season. Both Adidas and Hollister will have a fine selection to choose from, and their popularity means you won't have a hard time finding the right one for you.   

It's not too bad of an idea to throw a little extra greenbacks to invest in a great jacket - it's  worth the extra mileage it puts in your wardrobe.  

Usually, when trying to get a feel for what works, it's also a good idea to see what your friends like for inspiration.  "Winter fashion [in Miami] is a lighter version of European chic: just as fierce, but less layers; nothing is better than a fitted jacket and a great pair of jeans, suede loafers and a random scarf," said sophomore Luis Ayuso.  

The best piece of advice anyone can give this winter season is to remember to dress comfortably. 

 If you're going to be on campus, you don't want to feel cluttered and suffocated because you are overdressed, or shivering because you still think flip flops and shorts are cute. You're not going to look cute with beads of sweat messing up your hairline, or by having a bunch of goose bumps surging all over your legs whenever a gust of wind blows. 

 Dressing for winter should be fun; you can do more since you are expected to wear a little more. With more options, you can be a little more creative with your outfit now that the weather permits. Take advantage while you can.
