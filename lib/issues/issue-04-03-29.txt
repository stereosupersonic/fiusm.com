Headline: Drummer Moretti deals with The Strokes' fame
Author: Jim Abbott / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
In a Rolling Stone cover story last fall, drummer Fabrizio Moretti was touted as the "deep thinker" of the Strokes, the band most responsible for sending modern rock back into the garage.

No one ever said that about Ringo.

"I wish I had a deep thinker answer for that," Moretti says when pressed for a nugget of intellectual wisdom. "I guess it's an honor, but it's just one person's opinion and we'll have to wait to find out. I could have been called the skinny, frizzy-haired drummer."

After falling over their thesauri to praise the band's Is This It debut, rock writers reacted less unanimously to the band's sophomore Room on Fire. The follow-up unfolds with a more deliberate pace, and several songs strongly echo the formula on the first album.

The Strokes profess not to care about the hype.

"If you pay attention, it can sway you in both a negative and a positive way," Moretti says. "You can get a big head, and it also can knock you down. So the intelligent thing to do in a case when you are being spoken about is not to pay attention."

But you're in the biggest band in the world, right?

"That's ridiculous," Moretti says of that kind of hype. "At the same time, I'm not sitting in a corner because some guy spoke badly about the drum parts. We do the press because we know logically it influences how we are perceived, but we don't pay attention to it after the fact."

Moretti confesses he is mystified that someone would love the first album and dislike the second, because they're similar.

"We are growing as a band, but not necessarily in leaps and bounds," he explains. "The songs on the second record are a lot more three-dimensional. I'm very proud of the songs, not at all uncomfortable about the fact that we chose to produce it in a similar fashion."

There's an undeniable sameness to Room on Fire's "Reptilia," with the churning guitars of Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. forming the foundation for singer Julian Casablancas' nicotine-stained howling.

Yet there's also a bluesy tint to the guitar solo on "Between Love & Hate" that takes the band where it hasn't been before. Bassist Nik Fraiture brushes against a caffeinated reggae beat in the same song.

"We're in a different place rhythmically, melodically, lyrically," Moretti says. "We worked really hard on developing that. It's not that straight-ahead rock that the first album was.

"If people spent half as much time actually listening to the record instead of thinking about what they are going to say about it, they would come up with something better to say."

Though Moretti defends the band's music enthusiastically and articulately - maybe he is the smart one - he is still adjusting to the insatiable glare of the media spotlight.

He is willing to set the record straight about a supposed feud with Aussie retro-rockers Jet that was reported in December in New Music Express.	

NME quoted Jet drummer Chris Cester reacting to a comment from Casablancas in Rolling Stone, where he said that "Jet makes me not want to make music."

Cester's response: "They have lost any credibility from me. I think they made a pretty good record, but I can't listen to it anymore because I don't really dig 'em anymore."

Moretti says that the bands met at the recent Big Day Out festival in Australia and there's no bad blood.

"That was so blown out of proportion. It was just a misquote. They are quite remarkable people. Very kind and very sweet actually."

Moretti, who doesn't carry a cell phone and doesn't particularly enjoy doing interviews, is smart enough to know that it's not good if even unwanted attention goes away.

"The only downside is trying to maintain this kind the mystique," he says. "There's a lot of compromises we have to make that we didn't think we would have to make to try to stay afloat."

Headline: Smith on his new film Jersey Girl
Author: Jorge Montes / Information Technology Consultant
&nbsp;
"Kevin likes to talk."

And with that bold understatement, my day of meeting writer/director Kevin Smith began.

The meeting was a part of Smith's touring around the United States to promote his latest film, "Jersey Girl," which came out in theaters March 26. His past five films are considered cult classics, from the indie comedy "Clerks" to "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," his self-acknowledged "two-hour inside joke."

"Jersey Girl," he admits, is different. "I guess it's more accessible, but I never saw it as mainstream."

In the film, Ben Affleck plays Ollie Trinke, a PR executive whose life is thrown into chaos after the death of his wife during child birth, leaving him to move in with his own father, Bart (George Carlin), and help raise his daughter.

He does admit that fans of his earlier films may have a problem with this one. "The only thing I can do is make the movie I wanted to make. People that love Jay and Silent Bob, the 13 and 14 year olds, they're not going to see this picture. What's in it for them? Who are they going to identify with?"

"By virtue of the fact we have a 7-year-old girl," Smith admits, "we couldn't have people sitting around talking about c--k-chugging. After five movies, I just didn't know how else to say f--k. I did every variation on that. It's nice to step away from that."

Smith recognizes that his fanbase is varied. "There are those who love [all my films] across the board. I think they'll show up. There are some who only like 'Chasing Amy' and hate the others. They'll show up. Then there are people who think I haven't made a decent movie since 'Clerks.' Some of them will show out of curiosity to see if I f--ked up again.

"If we wind up doing another Jay and Silent Bob movie, maybe they'll come back. Or maybe they'll have grown up and be able to appreciate 'Jersey Girl.'"

As for Jennifer Lopez, who Smith cast in the small role of Affleck's wife (she dies 15 minutes into the film), he admits, "I cast her cause Affleck was like 'Uh, can we put my friend in the movie?' which turned out to be his girlfriend." 

Smith jokes about the film's alter-ego, the 1992 "Jersey Girl," starring Jami Gertz. "Did I know there was already a movie called 'Jersey Girl?' Well, I wanted to call it 'Star Wars,' but that was taken also."

On Carlin's turn as Affleck's father, Smith explains that Carlin's "a frustrated actor. This was the chance for him to be more than funny, but to act, to be dramatic. He relished the opportunity."

Smith admits to not being a "visual director." For "Jersey Girl," however, Smith had Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. "Having Vilmos made all the difference between looking good and looking great. Affleck was like 'For the first time in one of your movies, I don't look like I was hit in the face with a shovel This guy's a master.'"

As for not having a bit role in the movie, as he's done in his past films, Smith has a simple answer. "It felt nice to sit out and ride the chair. It was nice to make something and have one job."

The next project for Smith is both his first adaptation and his first big-budget action film, "Green Hornet," which is based on the comic book. Smith jokes about the mere idea of him doing a comic book movie. "My version would be two guys talking about how they should fight crime and how they should do something. But they're too busy talking about about it and then they start talking about sex and their dick sizes and what not."

It's been 10 years since "Clerks"  and Smith still has a hard time accepting the reality of his life; that a "register jockey" could wind up being a famous director with a fan following.

"Most mornings, I wake up and expect Rod Serling to step out and say 'Submitted for your approval. We just f--ked with this dude's head for 10 years. He just fell asleep on the counter. He's about to wake up.' I feel lucky. Beyond lucky. It's winning the lottery. 

"I mean, I have five action figures of me!"

Headline: Baseball's hot streak continues, wins four of six
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers continued their home stand, and defeated non-conference opponents Rider and Manhattan twice, dropped a contest to Iona and split a pair of games with Rutgers to improve to 14-16.

March 15 - FIU 9, Rider 6

FIU, led by Dennis Diaz's first two-homerun game of his career, knocked off Rider, 9-6, at University Park.

The win was FIU's fifth in a row, improving the team to 11-14. Rider (1-8) lost for the seventh straight time.

P.J. Lehmann contributed two hits and Jeff Skellenger had a pair of RBIs to lead FIU offensively.

Pitchers Luis Gazitua and Manuel Monreal allowed 10 hits to the Broncos, but combined for 12 strikeouts.  Monreal (1-0) got the win, his first of the season.

March 16 - FIU 13, Rutgers 10

Just as the Sun Belt Conference play begins to grow closer, the Golden Panthers continued to build steam with a 13-10 victory over Rutgers at UP, stretching the team's winning streak to six games.

Mike Lopez's two-out grand slam capped an eight-run rally in the eighth to give FIU the win.

FIU led 5-0 after six innings, but Rutgers fired back with six runs in the seventh and four more in the eighth to take a 10-5 lead entering the bottom half of the eighth.

Jeff Skellenger (4-for-5, two runs) started the eighth inning rally with a two-run shot to left, cutting the Rutgers lead to 10-7. After RBIs by Diaz and Yahmed Yema made the score 10-9, Lopez delivered a blast to right field to give FIU a 13-10 lead it wouldn't surrender.

Starting pitcher John Banke kept the Scarlet Knights in check, striking out four and allowing only three hits in the first six innings. Rutgers quickly answered back in the seventh inning as they took back a 6-5 lead after seven hits off of Banke and reliever Mark Worrell. Danny Hernandez threw a scoreless ninth inning and picked up his first save, while junior Leo Calderon (1-0) took the win. FIU improved to 12-14 while Rutgers fell to 4-9.	

March 17 - Iona 5, FIU 2

One game after erupting for 13 runs on 13 hits, the FIU bats were kept silent by visiting Gaels pitcher Sean Kramer as FIU fell to Iona, 5-2. 

Kramer held FIU to only five hits as Iona won for only the third time on 15 games.

Trailing 1-0 in the second, Eduardo Davila tied up the score with an RBI groundout to third base, scoring Lopez.

But the Gaels regained their lead with RBI singles in the third and sixth off FIU starter David Asher (1-2), who lasted seven innings in the losing cause.

Yahmed Yema drew FIU within two runs with his fifth homerun of the season, a solo shot in the sixth, but it wasn't enough.

FIU fell to 12-15 with the loss.

March 18 - Rutgers 4, FIU 3

Playing their 10th game in 11 days and playing a scrappy Rutgers bunch for the second time in three days didn't fare well for FIU, as it lost its second straight game, 4-3.  

FIU lost despite striking out 15 Scarlet Knight batters, including 11 by starter Derek DeCarlo, who fell to 1-5 on the season.

DeCarlo allowed only three runs in six innings of work, but the FIU offense was unable to get anything going as the team combined to go 4-for-29 at the plate.

Dennis Diaz's fifth homerun of the season in the eighth made it a one-run game, but FIU would get no closer, falling to 12-16.

March 19 - FIU 8, Manhattan 4

FIU rallied with six runs in the seventh inning to rebound from two straight losses with an 8-4 win over the Jaspers at UP.

The Golden Panthers trailed 3-2 entering the seventh, but responded with four hits and took the lead after RBI singles by Lehmann, Cody Jacobs, Lopez and Brian Aragon.

Lehmann's single, one of two hits, extended his hitting streak to 10 games.

Frank Gonzalez (1-0) picked up his first win of the season and his first since Feb. 21, 2003. He gave up three hits and struck out three. Andrew Edwards had a strong game, pitching five and two-thirds innings while striking out six to match a season-high.  

Fernando Alvarez picked up his fourth multi-hit game and first multi-RBI game of the season to lead the Golden Panther offense. 

March 20 - FIU 5, Manhattan 3

The team and theme were the same as FIU once again rallied to defeat the Jaspers, 5-3, at UP.

FIU starter Denny Hernandez struggled, allowing three hits and three runs in an inning and two-thirds, but the FIU bats responded in the late stages of the game.

After only producing one hit in the first five innings, FIU cut the lead to 3-2 in the sixth on a two-run single by Skellenger (2-for-3).

Alvarez led off the seventh with a triple and FIU added two more runs on an RBI single by Adrian Casanova and an RBI sacrifice fly by Jacobs.	

FIU added one more in the eighth on a fielder's choice RBI by Alvarez.

Junior Mark Worrell (2-5) dominated the Jaspers, pitching five and one-thirds innings, allowing five hits and one walk. He struck out five to pick up his second victory of the season. 

Teammate Danny Hernandez pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth to pick up his second save of the season, striking out four in the process. With the win, FIU concluded a 13-day stretch in which the team played 11 games. FIU went 8-3 over the span and will next face the sixth-ranked Miami Hurricanes at Mark Light Stadium in Coral Gables on March 24. The two teams have split two games so far this season.

Subheadline: Lady Golden Panthers win four of five before taking runner-up honors
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The FIU softball team took part in the FAU "Parents Weekend" Tournament in Boca Raton last week, but not before taking on non-conference opponent Miami (Ohio) at UP on March 17.

The Lady Golden Panthers defeated the RedHawks, 3-0, and then headed to Boca, where they won three of four games to advance to the tournament championship. 

However, FIU fell to Florida Atlantic, resulting in the second consecutive runner-up finish for the Lady Golden Panthers in tournament play over the past two weeks.

FIU now stands at 15-17 with 15 games remaining.

March 17 - FIU 3, Miami (Ohio) 0

Kendra Laminack and Amanda Nealer combined for a three-hit shutout as FIU defeated the RedHawks at home.

Laminack (7-6) lasted four innings, allowing only two hits and striking out four to earn the win.

Nealer finished off the game's final three innings with a one-hit, seven-strikeout performance to earn her first save since her freshman year in 2002.

FIU was led offensively by Marleah Stapf (2-for-3, two RBI), who belted a two-run shot in the sixth inning.

Cindy Turek scored the game's first run when Jennifer Owens reached base on an error.

March 19 - FIU 4, Akron 1

The Lady Golden Panthers, led by six solid innings on the mound by Nealer, kicked off tournament play with a 4-1 victory over the Zips.

Nealer allowed only one run on two hits and struck out six to improve her record to 4-4.

FIU scored two runs in the second on singles by Tabitha Embry and Turek, and added another run in the fourth when Turek scored on a wild pitch after tripling to right-center.

Owens (3-for-4) added an insurance run in the seventh inning with her first homerun of the season - a blast to left field.

Nicole Barrett retired the side in the seventh to earn her fourth save.

March 19 - FAU 4, FIU 3

Jessica Sachs' two-run single in the sixth inning gave the Owls a 4-3 victory over FIU in the Golden Panthers' second game of the day. Laminack started for FIU and allowed four hits and five walks in five innings, with her control problems ultimately proving costly in the end.
FIU trailed 2-0 early, but singles by Tippings in the second and Owens in the third tied the game at two.

Jacque Vetters scored her second run of the game in the fifth after a wild throw on an Owens' single to give FIU a 3-2 lead. 

But FAU capitalized on Laminack's erratic pitching in the sixth. After Laminack walked a batter and allowed a single, Barrett entered the game and retired a batter before allowing the game-winning hit to Sachs.
Laminack (7-7) took the loss.

March 20 - FIU 3, Kent St. 0

Laminack and Barrett combined for a three-hit shutout in defeating Kent State, 3-0. 

Embry's first career homer, a two-run shot to left in the fifth, and an RBI single by Jennifer Powell in the sixth, gave FIU all the runs it would need.
Laminack (8-7) pitched five and two-thirds innings and allowed only two hits while walking none. 

Barrett pitched an inning and a third of shutout ball to earn her fifth save of the season.

Owens continued her hot hitting with a 3-for-3 performance and a run scored.

March 20 - FIU 5, Okla. St. 4

A single by Embry in the sixth inning propelled the Lady Golden Panthers to a 5-4 win over the Cowgirls, advancing FIU to the tournament championship game. 

Trailing 4-3 entering the bottom of the sixth, FIU tied the game on a throwing error by Cowgirls catcher Courtney Totte, which scored Powell, who had singled to lead off the inning. 

Embry followed that up with her team-leading 13th RBI for the game-winning hit.

Laminack, who pitched an inning and a third of scoreless relief, earned the win to improve to 9-7.

March 21 - Tournament Championship Game - FAU 3, FIU 1

Candice Freel pitched a complete game and had all three of her team's RBIs as the Owls defeated the Lady Panthers, 3-1, in the FAU "Parents' Weekend" Tournament championship game.

Freel scattered three hits over seven innings, allowing only one unearned run to earn her seventh straight victory and extend her team's winning streak to seven games.

Nealer (4-5) fell behind early, allowing a two-single to Freel, after allowing a single to tournament MVP Sachs and walking Mazzarella. 

Freel drove in her third run of the game on a double off of Nealer in the third to give herself all the runs she would need.

Vetters scored FIU's only run after a ball hit by Owens was misplayed by FAU shortstop Jenna Lopez. 

Owens finished the tournament with a .600 average (9-for-15), with a homer and four RBI to lead FIU.

Guest lecturer's credentials questionable

To the Editor:

FIU's Student Government Association promoted the evolution lecture by Dr. Carl Baugh like the United States president was coming to speak. 
I did a short internet search to learn a little more about Baugh and it didn't take long to find out that he is a fraud.

"Dr." Baugh, who in fact is not a doctor and doesn't have a doctorate in philosophy, is being promoted as a scientist when in reality he is a fraudulent preacher. Perhaps the most troublesome of Baugh's claims concerns his credentials. Baugh claims to have earned a doctorate in theology as well as advanvced degrees in several fields of science, yet there is no evidence that Baugh has any earned degrees whatsoever. 
To see a detailed discussion on this matter, please see the article "A Matter of Degree," at www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/degrees.html. 
Although it is possible to do good work without having advanced degrees, misrepresenting one's credentials is a serious matter which bears directly on one's basic honesty and integrity. 

Some Christians will try to use Baugh's "evidences" in witnessing and get "shot down" by someone who is scientifically literate.
The ones witnessed to will thereafter be wary of all creation evidences and even more inclined to dismiss Christians as nut cases not worth listening to. Also, the Christian is likely to be less apt to witness, even perhaps tempted to doubt his or her own faith (wondering what other misinformation they have gullibly believed from Christian teachers). 
The Christian Student Fellowship tries to strengthen the faith of Christians and equip them for the work of evangelism, and, sadly, the long term effect of Baugh's efforts will be detrimental to both. So what's up with SGA? I'm sure some FIU students went to listen to Baugh and have been misled. This is what I'm always keeping a look out for. 
It's hard enough to sift through the fakes without having to deal with SGA also trying to misdirect people. 
What's the lesson?  You must choose where you get your information wisely. Misdirection is everywhere.   
Whoever at SGA is responsible for this should be voted out of office.

Gays encounter ignorance, prejudice on road to social equality

To the Editor:

"By changing oneself then one's family you have opened the door to changing your neighbors, your town, and your country,"  said Eduardo Baqueiro in a column published in The Beacon on March 3.  This is what gay people do everyday.  Despite danger and obstacles we come out to ourselves, our families, our neighbors. We fight the battle for equality every day of our lives, a struggle no heterosexual person could ever truly know.   Now our struggle takes us to an even more visible and dangerous space in our quest for the equality of marriage.
 Gay families exist now.  We are not a new occurrence that has suddenly sprung on society seeking to destroy it. We have existed forever. It is now that we are being viewed as a threat because we are asking to be acknowledged and treated equally in the eyes of the law.  

Some feel that we are being difficult because we are not willing to accept "separate but equal" accommodations. Throughout our history, this has been an attempt to pacify and silence minorities. This is an attempt to silence us, to diminish our love and commitment to one another and the children we raise. Rosa Parks did not accept separate but equal. Martin Luther King did not accept separate but equal.  I see no difference. It pains me to see that so many people are being fooled by the elite hierarchy of our country which sits on its throne throwing peanuts at us all, as we fight for them like pigeons. Only when we move beyond these squabbles will we be able to put an end to inequality in all forms. This is bigger than just gays looking to make a stink and cause problems. It is this generation's call to action. 

We will not accept second class status anymore. It is neither illogical nor unnecessary.  It is our survival as people and families. "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" does not signal our status as free people. 
How can we be free when newspaper articles like yours call our families a cancer on society? The cancer of our society is ignorance. It is our perpetual dismissiveness of our own history that enables intolerance, hatred, and inequality to exist. Examining, owning, and deconstructing our own biases and prejudices is how we can all work to create the "healthy society" you speak of.

Headline: Students, alumni lobby for FIU
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
About a dozen Student Government and Student Alumni Association members traveled to Tallahasse to promote FIU issues March 16, FIU Student Day. Students met with legislators to lobby issues such as enrollment growth, student fees, Bright Futures Scholarship, and funding.  "This is great opportunity to make an impression ... [Congress] gets to put a face to the issues" said University Park student government President, Clayton Solomon.  With the help of FIU graduate Anitere Flores, director of State Relations for the university and Debi Gallay, senior budget and policy advisor, student leaders prioritized topics to discuss with the representatives and senators.

The reoccurring topic of discussion throughout the day was the Bright Futures Scholarship Program, which is currently in jeopardy due to a lack of funding. Rep. Juan Zapata (R-Miami), attributed the problem to quick growth in student population. "[FIU has] grown a lot faster than the funding has," Zapata said, "and politically [Bright Futures] is a hot potato ... no one wants to be responsible"

According to Zapata, the State spends $18 billion on K-20 education each year. Only $1 billion of that comes from the Florida Lottery, which funds the Bright Futures Scholarship Program. Zapata also said that Education beats Medicaid for the largest piece of the approximately $50 billion state budget. "In five years [the education budget] will be twice as much .... scholarship standards are too low." Zapata said.  Gov. Jeb Bush's block tuition proposal, which recommends a "fixed" tuition price of 15 credit hours regardless of actual credits taken, was also addressed. Student government leaders argued that because of FIU's working and commuter student population, block tuition will be unfavorable. 

They also argued against a bill, currently in the legislature, that seeks to prohibit state financial aid to international students. Students expressed their disapproval for the bill and outlined why this bill will be particularly damaging to FIU. "We are proud of our diversity, we should all get the same opportunity," Flores said.

FIU trustees were also in Tallahassee, where they met with legislators and Gov. Bush. Trustees lobbied mainly for funding and reminded legislators of FIU's unique "landscape."

According to Board of Trustees Chair Adolfo Henriquez, FIU is substantially underfunded and needs at least an extra $12.5 million to bring it to par with other state universities.

"FIU is the worst funded [university] ... if you take our undergraduate average funding, it's much less." said Henriquez. "If we have no money we can't compete, we can't pay competitive salaries for professors." 

Rep.Rene Garcia (R-Hialeah), believes that FIU's problem is location."FIU's biggest problem is that it is in South Florida. Anywhere else, funding is not a problem" Garcia said.

According to students and organizers the day was a success. "It was a productive day . . . they'll remember us now, I think we accomplished a lot," said Flores.

Headline: Gov. bush calls for tuition hike, block tuition
Author: Mark Scopetta/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Gov. Jeb Bush's proposed budget for 2004 calls for increasing spending on education by more than $1 billion. This, however, isn't enough to mitigate the need to increase tuition at state universities for residents by 7.5 percent and all other students by 12.5 percent.

 This comes in on the heels of last year's 8.5 percent increase and there has  been a total increase of 31 percent over the last five years. If Bush's budget is approved, tuition could increase by $200 for residents, by $406.88 for out-of-state students, and as much as $1,711.99 for non-residents.

"The increases are important," said MacKay Jimeson, the Governor's spokesman. "The number of students who are attending state universities is rising and we need to ensure the proper professor to student ratio. We also need to make sure that there are enough resources to match the rising number of students. 

"Even if this raise in tuition is passed, Florida will still rank 49th over all in the cost of tuition."

Jimeson also stated that "the Governor will be increasing funding to the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program to match the increase in demand for financial aid," but he didn't comment on how much.

Gonzalo Zubaria, a fourth year accounting student, said "I don't mind that they raise the tuition as long as I can see the difference. I'd want fewer people in the classes or improvements made to facilities, which FIU has been doing."

Vice Provost Marie Zeglen said "We are very concerned for the non-resident student. We are already in the top quartile for state universities and the new increases might discourage out of state and international students from attending FIU."

Another item on the governor's budget is block tuition, under which all full-time students will be charged for 15 credit hours.

 Block tuition is new to the Governor's budget but is not new to Florida, it existed many years ago. "With block tuition we hope to entice students to at least take a full load of classes or more and graduate on time instead of in five or six years. This practice worked in the past and we are hoping that it will work again,"Jimeson said.

Clayton Solomon, University Park student government president, said "block tuition for FIU is a bad idea. It will punish the non-traditional student, those who work and attend school, by forcing them to drop down to nine credits and no longer be full time." 

Zeglen said "block tuition might benefit other universities but it doesn't help FIU. This will greatly reduce revenues at FIU. With the loss of tuition from students who are taking 16 credit hours or more,  we expect to lose $500,000. Over all, it's not much of an advantage for FIU." 

"I'd rather keep it the way it is now," said Zubaria. "If they really want to encourage students to take more classes, they should only charge for 15 credits for those who are taking more. Otherwise they would really hurt the student who also works while he attends class and doesn't have the time to take more than 12 credits."

Bush is also trying to make non-degree seeking students pay full price for tuition regardless of their residency. This will mean that non-degree seeking resident students will be paying $513.60 per credit instead of $95.60. 

"This will greatly affect our ability to attract the part time student," Zeglen said, "It costs too much. The non-degree seeking students who are trying to learn new skills or are trying to improve their position at work will be greatly discouraged to attend classes."

Headline: Program offers free help with taxes
Author: Jessica Martin/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As tax season rapidly comes to a close many people are anxious to have their taxes filed before the April 15 deadline.  

Tax season can be an extremely stressful time. All of the forms and tax laws can be downright intimidating and puzzling to many people. 

The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA) hopes to alleviate the stress.

The VITA program was created by the Internal Revenue Service to help low to moderate income people who cannot prepare their own taxes.  

They offer free tax help to people who qualify. To qualify you must earn less than $35,000 per year.  

The College of Business Administration's VITA program at FIU began with Myron Lubell in the 1980s. 

Recently, the FIU VITA program  expanded its services to accommodate FIU's growing international student population. Presently, there are two CBA VITA sites: Navarro Discount Pharmacies located at 12000 S.W. 8th St. and the Green Library. The Navarro site is open to the public while the GL Site is exclusively for international students.   

Beginning last February, help for international students became available in room 220 of the Green Library.  

The volunteers at the GL site will assist international students with their income tax returns. 

David Lavin, has reactivated the VITA program and has spent the past few months training more than 90 CBA undergraduates as VITA volunteers, who must pass an exit examination before assisting the public with their taxes. 

During the four training sessions students attend, they learn how to use the TaxWise software program - used to prepare various tax forms and tricks of the trade that are not found in text books. 

The university's VITA volunteers represent the largest trained non-IRS vounteers group in the Miami area. 

"I highly recommend that international students take advantage of this service," Lavin said. All international students are required to file whether or not they have income. "There are many rules that are unique to international students that we can help them with." 

"Our service is free, so why not take full advantage?" said Juliana Moya, a site supervisor and accounting major.  

Each site provides the proper forms and counseling to all who seek it.  Students can have their questions answered by trained volunteers. 

International students must bring their passport, visa, social security card, or ITIN Card,  Form I-94, and SEVIS I-20.  "A consultation usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes but it will go by much quicker if you bring in the correct paper work," said Moya. 

Both the Navarro and GL site hold their programs twice a week until April 14. 

The GL site will have sessions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 1:30-6 p.m. Navarro will hold sessions Wednesdays from 5-9 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Consultations are on a first come, first served basis. 

It's important that interested students seek assistance as early as possible it is anticipated that each site will become busier as the deadline approaches.

Both sites will provide accurate and expedient assistance to all who seek it. 

"I encourage everyone to come by our site, even if you have a question," said Moya. "We are all here to help."

Headline: New club helps students manage finances
Author: Marianly Hernandez/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A new organization has sprung up at FIU hoping to answer questions students have concerning finances.

Students in Free Enterprise are currently learning about managing finances after college, getting a grip on credit card debt and securing scholarship possibilities while reaching a hand out to the community.

SIFE is an international nonprofit organization with teams on more than 1,600 college and university campuses in 40 countries.  

Throughout the United States, SIFE teams have taught students of all ages about basic budgeting, accounting, and supply and demand. Its members have helped eager entrepreneurs realize their plans as well as struggling business owners improve their conditions.  Other members have mentored at-risk students.

"You can educate yourself, but if you don't know how to build credit or how not to fall prey to credit card debt, or buying a home. We want to teach students about that," said Ninoska "Nina" Palacios, one of two vice presidents at University Park's SIFE.

There is no required GPA or major to join.

"Just as long as you are willing to work, as long as you're dedicated. That's all we ask for, dedication," Palacios said.

Damarys Ramos, a founding committee member, said "What truly sets us apart is that we are an organization where everyone is welcome, be it professors or students are welcome to join SIFE."

Membership fees of $20 are paid on a semester basis. In return, members receive a SIFE t-shirt each semester. 

Kavitha Singhs and Palacios formed the SIFE team at UP this semester.

"I've been an active member in SIFE for over two years [at Miami-Dade College].  Throughout this time I've learned many skills, and gained experience to become a successful person.  Every student should have the opportunities that SIFE has to offer," Singhs said.  

SIFE teams across the country help in a many  ways.  For example, SIFE at UP has already held a lecture called "Life After College," where a financial advisor from AG Edwards, a financial consulting company, taught FIU students how to build an investment portfolio.

In Texas, a SIFE team helped a local business owner pinpoint an overseas market for his product. In California, another team showed welfare beneficiaries how to run a daycare business.

In addition, the Miami- Dade College SIFE team taught fourth and fifth graders at Kenwood and Sunset Park elementary schools marketing through the usage of logos and the basics of supply and demand.  

"There is a great deal of self empowerment that comes from being able to apply and teach others what you've learned through your studies about business.  It's a great way to put your skills into practice," Ramos said. 

"We encourage all our members to go ahead and  write down ideas [for projects] and then at the meetings we vote on them," Palacios said. "We're going to be brainstorming projects and just coming up with solid ideas so that we can implement those next [fall]."  

SIFE expects to continue the "Life After College" lectures on paying off debtors and buying a home. 

Each spring, SIFE teams have the chance to attend a two-day regional competition, where the individual teams present on video or PowerPoint the community projects they conducted during the year. 

SIFE's corporate sponsors judge the competition and the winning team leaves with $13,500 in cash awards.  Scholarships are also awarded with the faculty advisor's recommendation, provided that the individual member meets a list of qualifications. A winning team from each region is picked to go the national competition on May 23-25 in Kansas City, Missouri.

 At the end of the Regional and National competitions, all the students attend a career fair attended by corporations sponsoring SIFE. The national winner will compete at the SIFE World Cup in September 2004 in Barcelona, Spain.

"If our SIFE team continues to grow at this rate, I have no doubt that our team can go to regional championships, and return to FIU with a win," Singh explained.  "As for national competition, we have just as good a chance as all the other teams to 'change the world.'"

Headline: SGA candidates prepare to launch campaigns following 'Know Your Vote'
Author: C. Joel Marino/Assistant News Editor
&nbsp;
Flyers, and posters, open-forum discussions and heated debates - around every corner of FIU's University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses, candidates for the upcoming SGA elections are readying themselves for what might be called a week of choices.

In efforts to help all those running for office, the University Park Student Government Council has been planning several key events in order to draw a wider field of student support, beginning Monday at the Graham Center Pit with a "Know your Vote" presentation and ending before the students vote on April 6 and 7.

Campaigning, however, will not officially begin until Wednesday following a candidate debate in the GC Pit. 

Most of the candidates believe these events are necessary for their campaigns.

Freshman Mari Lourdes Cabrera, a candidate for lower division representative, said she plans on attending all SGA events with hopes that students will "be made aware that I am here and willing to stand out."

Of most importance to her is the "Chill with the Candidates" event at the Housing Quad on Tuesday in which students will be able to talk with the candidates while enjoying ice cream sundaes.

"I think this is an important time to meet these students, especially the resident students, which we often forget," Cabrera said. "We assume that, because they live here, they're going to get involved. They're our greatest resource, and I respect their voice."

Kenny Alce, a sophomore and a candidate for representative-at-large, will also be taking advantage of the SGA sponsored events, acknowledging the amount of impact they will play in his campaign. 

"I'm a rookie when it comes to campaigning, so I'll be involved in as many things as I can. I want to meet many students personally and let them know that I'm also like them: a student first and foremost," said Alce.

Sam Youn, freshman and chemistry major, looks forward to these events because he feels he is not totally familiar with either the candidates or their issues.

"It's good to know who you're voting for because it's important to have the right people representing us."

As part of their campaign guidelines, candidates will not be allowed to send mass e-mails, use easel signs, or be able to reserve the whole area of the Betty Chapman Plaza or fountain. 

The election results for the University Park campus will be announced April 8 at noon in the GC Pit.	

The Beacon could not reach student government officials at the BBC regarding the campaigning and election schedule, despite numerous attempts.

Headline: Eternal Sunshine: Carey makes film unique
Author: Krystal Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Wouldn't it be great to erase all those bad memories of past relationships and never be able to remember those moments of utter romantic despair, or that one person that broke your heart into a million pieces? 
I'm sure everyone at one time or another has thought that removing someone or some relationship from their memory would help them lead a better life, a new life free of emotional baggage. 
In the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carey), obliterating the memory of his ex-girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), was the only option left. 
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" takes place in the mind of Joel as the memories of Clementine are being erased. Every moment and subconscious thought about Clementine is being destroyed by a new scientific procedure that eliminates unwanted memories.  
Joel's most intimate moments with Clementine are exposed for the viewing audience. Every fight and every beautiful moment is being observed through his perspective. 
As the procedure goes on, Joel becomes aware of what is occurring and decides that he still cherishes the defining memories of Clementine. 
This is where the plot really takes off as Joel tries to wake up and remember his treasured memories before they are completely erased. 
With a screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman, who also wrote "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich," it is no wonder that  the movie has its twists and takes the audience on an unforgettable ride. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" fuses real time with what is occurring in Joel's mind as these memories are dying. 
Something so difficult to even verbalize (as remembering a specific moment), is magically captured through unusual camera shots and amazing imagery. 
The way people remember certain moments is portrayed divinely, without an exaggeration or a cheap hazy, foggy look. The movie makes you feel completely at one with Joel's mind. 
Carey's performance is at its best. "The Truman Show" and "The Majestic" tried to showcase Carey as a serious actor, but "Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind" really makes you forget about Carey's slapstick side. 
His acting seems effortless, and you are sure to fall in love with his dopey, insecure character right off the bat. Winslet executes the role of Clementine beautifully as well. They are a physically odd-looking couple with a slew of problems
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is an experience that leaves you forgetting you are in a movie theater. It is one of those reflective films that offers the audience a greater appreciation for life; it is unique in the way that it accomplishes that. 
It portrays everything realistically, with all its ugly flaws. It doesn't try to hide the inequities of life, making note of them, and spotlighting why even those moments are essential. It is a truly remarkable film that will have you appreciating even the lousiest of your ex-signifigant others.

Headline: Gruesome zombies redefine horror genre
Author: Gary Dowell / The Dallas Morning News
&nbsp;
Typically presented as walking half-rotted corpses, mindless slaves or both, zombies rank rather low in the pantheon of horror movie boogiemen, more disgusting than terrifying. Yet, while they may not be as sexy as vampires or as fearsome as werewolves, zombies have had their share of classic movies. Here's a sampling of the best:

"White Zombie" (1932): After his legendary performance in "Dracula," Bela Lugosi appeared in the prototypical zombie movie. Lugosi plays a hypnotist and voodoo master who supplies the local Haitian mills with zombie labor and draws two newlyweds into his world of the undead. An ambitious low-budget movie that lifted the gothic atmosphere of the early Universal horror classics

"Night of the Living Dead" (1968): The first in writer-director George Romero's zombie trilogy set the standard for just about every zombie movie made since. Filmed cinema verite-style and in stark black and white, the movie centers on a group of people trapped in a farmhouse when the dead suddenly and inexplicably rise from the graves and begin attacking and eating the living. The result is an eerie examination of human nature and a stinging comment on the angst and paranoia of the late `60s. The film was remade in 1990. 

"Dawn of the Dead" (1978): "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk" - and they'll head straight for the mall. Romero's second zombie movie is, at its black little heart, a satire on consumerism. Refugees from the zombie plague of the first movie take shelter in a shopping mall infested with undead, who stumble mindlessly through the shops and food courts while Muzak plays over the intercom. Our heroes struggle to establish something resembling civilization while fighting off barbarism in the form of a gang of rampaging bikers. The original has been re-released on DVD as part of the buzz surrounding the new remake.

"Day of the Dead" (1985): Romero concludes his zombie cycle with a nihilistic coda that offers only a faint glimmer of hope. The world is now overrun with the undead, who outnumber the living by 400,000 to one. A small group of demented soldiers and mad scientists have holed up in an underground bunker, where they are at odds with each other over the situation. More dramatic than the previous two and, in a way, more disturbing.

"The Return of the Living Dead" (1985): Sci-fi-horror screenwriter Dan O'Bannon made his directing debut with this comedic-yet-harrowing zombie flick. Yet another group of beleaguered souls are forced to make a desperate stand when a toxic gas leak in Louisville, Ky., causes the dead to return to life and eat the brains of anyone they can get their hands on. It's an interesting blend of ghoulish comedy and even more ghoulish horror.

"The Serpent and the Rainbow" (1988): Fright-master Wes Craven's entry into the fold with an exotic, atmospheric tale loosely based on a true story set in Haiti during the uprising that ousted "Baby Doc" Duvalier. Bill Pullman stars as a scientist seeking a drug used in zombie rituals that renders its victims paralyzed but conscious, and he becomes involved in political intrigue as well as in the world of voodoo.

"Dead Alive" (1992): Before he was the "Lord of the "Rings," Peter Jackson made a name for himself making cheap, funny, very gross and very tacky movies like "Bad Taste," "Meet the Feebles" and this little number about a hapless hero whose overbearing mother initiates a zombie plague after being bitten by a rat monkey. Gross-out gags, zombie toddlers and a preacher who knows kung fu - this one's got it all.

"28 Days Later" (2002): "Trainspotting" director Danny Boyle put a new spin on zombies with his low-budget, high-scares thriller in which England is overwhelmed by a virus that puts its victims into a permanent stage of rage. The obligatory band of survivors heads from London to Manchester seeking refuge with a military unit. Shot on hand-held digital video, it has an intense documentary feel and is as effective a study of humanity under extreme duress as its predecessors.
