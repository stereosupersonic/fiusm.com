Dear Sir:

Early today, while lumbering towards my 10am, I grabbed the Sep. 6 issue and immediatley turned my attention to the back page. There were three articles, two football related and one about some European sport written by a Mr. Marino who in his first sentence professes no interest in his topic(nice one), but no actual sports coverage. The box scores must be inside, I thought, but no other sports articles existed, that is, unless you consider a "MC battle" to be athletic.

Your readers want to know, why no football recap? What about a box score? Anything? From what I remember of saturday, the game ended in the late-afternoon, giving you at least 60 hours for your reporters to tap out something before the issue hit the stands. 

It seems FIUsports.com is far better staffed than your organization - they have two articles referring to the results, a full box score, and numerous pictures.

I transferred to FIU this semester after having attended two small private colleges with poor varsity athletics. From what I understand, the Panthers have moved up to division 1A - a thrilling skill level compared to the bush league games I witnessed the past two years. Shouldn't the Beacon, at least, respect what these athletes have done and report on their first game in 1A?

I'm a journalism major and have been shuffling my feet and staring at my toes instead of applying for a job at your paper. After this surprise I may apply for the sports editor position; it appears someone isn't doing his job. I may not have any experience, but I would have definitely cracked skulls over this performance. I don't have a resume written out yet, but if I did it would already be on your desk.

Until the Beacon can find it's collective head, I'll be reading the opposing team's newspaper for a biased account of the game, but an account none-the-less. Until next saturday, I remain, baffled,

The people of Miami care.
We feel your pain and we understand,

But, I send to you these words from the heart.
"The storm has come, and it has passed.
So view this as your brand new start."

For you've lost so much, and so many.
But, love comes in abundance.
And for you, we have plenty.
So please don't ever give up hope,
You're much stronger than Katrina could ever be.
With love, from: your family in Miami, Florida.

Headline: Saints need  to 'distract' Big Easy
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastation, the residents of New Orleans are in dire need of something to feel good about - no matter how insignificant.

With the NFL season a hop, a skip and a jump away, a successful season from the New Orleans Saints can serve as a minor distraction, as well as a reason for residents to come together. 

Back in 2001, after the 9-11 tragedy, the city of New York rallied around the Yankees during their playoff run. 

Even though the Yankees ultimately lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in arguably the best World Series ever played, the city needed a bit of a distraction.

I know that sporting events, in the grand scheme of things, don't mean anything, but no one can argue that they can unify a city and make its citizens happier - even for a short while.

In 2003, during the Florida Marlins' World Series run, the city of Miami was pulsating with excitement. Streets were filled with people driving up and down at five miles-per-hour, having unofficial victory parades. 

Even though Miami didn't endure a catastrophe anywhere near that of Katrina, it still brought joy and togetherness to a city notoriously known for its rudeness. Even people who didn't care about sports were feeling it.

Now, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina there is a high possibility that the Saints will not be playing in New Orleans for the 2005 season, due to the damage caused to the Superdome. 

However, there is a possibility that their games will be moved to Tiger Stadium, where Louisiana State University plays their home games, in Baton Rouge, La. 

The other possible site mentioned was the Alamodome in San Antonio, but the NFL should try its best to keep the Saints as close to New Orleans as possible.

The question now is, "Can the Saints have a successful season?"

Well, taking into account that a majority of the team members have probably lost their homes, what state-of-mind the players will be in will be a huge factor. 

Also, taking into consideration the Saints' lack of success and, more importantly, their inability to reach the playoff in recent years.

When Jim Haslett took over as the New Orleans Saints head coach in 2000, he finished the season with a 10-6 record and an appearance in the second round of the playoffs. 

That season gave Saint fans something to hope for: The possibility of getting the city's first-ever Super Bowl title.

But, for the last four seasons, the Haslett-led Saints produced mediocrity, almost quite literally, amassing a 32-32 overall record.

And, much like the fans of every other NFL team, this preseason meant new hope for Saints fans and more pressure for Haslett. 

So now it lies on the Saints' and, especially, Haslett's shoulders. Will they be capable of causing a type of "distraction" with a possible playoff run or possibly a Super Bowl?

The team mantra for the 2005 Saints is, "The Superdome will rise again."

For the sake of New Orleans, let's hope so.

Headline: Men's Soccer Gets 'No Respect'
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
I don't like American football much, primarily because I can't understand its many complicated rules and because I see no passion in the game, a characteristic that leads to my eventual boredom.

Though I sometimes attend the FIU team's competitions when it's playing on campus, I know that if I ever feel like watching a real football game, I'll find it on the University Park soccer fields where I'll be, cheering for what I believe to be our underappreciated men's soccer team. 

Now, maybe my love for that specific sport could be seen as a little biased because I was born and raised in Argentina, a country where soccer fanaticism usually  marks true patriotism.

However, I believe that my support for the FIU men's soccer team is completely grounded on logic and fact: Not only has it been ranked one of the top 20 teams in the country by several soccer associations within the past three years (the National Soccer Coaches Association of America placed the team at number 10 in 2003), it has also had a long and accomplished history within the university, becoming the first champions of the Atlantic Soccer Conference when this was established in 2000.

Why then, with all the accolades and accomplishments that the team has garnered throughout the decades, does FIU's proven soccer program get (as comedian Rodney Dangerfield was prone to ask) 'no respect'?

In 2004, the FIU Access and Equity Committee investigated - among other equal-opportunity and equity issues within the university - disparities between the sports programs within the athletics department in a report submitted to the Florida Department of Education. 

This report mentioned a concern for "the apparent lack for substantial publicity for sports other than football," something which I'd noticed since my freshman year in 2003.

At that time, the only way I find out about a soccer game was through word of mouth or a casual glance at the athletics website. The football team, on the other hand, received a shower of flyers, parties, banners and posters announcing their schedule, even though the team was just entering its second season.

Perhaps it was due to this lack of publicity that, though soccer games still drew a relatively larger crowd than other programs, the fans were usually always the same people, either the friends or families of the players or immigrant soccer fans like me.

Besides this problem, the report also stated that "there is no dedicated space for soccer teams to practice" as well as a lack of appropriate restroom facilities for women at the fields.

While the football team got whatever prime space and time slot it needed for practices, the committee found that soccer players had to use an unkempt field also shared by intramural sports and were often forced to practice on land eventually used for the Red Parking Garage.

This treatment of an accomplished sports team frustrated me during my first years at FIU, especially since I saw no changes in the athletic department's policy.

However, I've recently been assured by members of the department's media relations and men's soccer coach Karl Kremser that things could very well change soon.

"We've struggled through a lot, I know that," Kremser said. "But we're getting the respect we deserve now, I guess since we've proven ourselves worthy."

Kremser is referring to the fact that the soccer team will compete for the first time this season as an associate member of Conference USA, one of the most prestigious conferences in the country.

Perhaps it's due to this major milestone (and the findings of the AEC report) that the soccer field has generously been resurfaced and plans are being made to replace the awfully deficient score board with a new one.  

Though the restroom problem still has not been fixed, field beautification continues with the addition of banners and other regalia around the field's rusty fences.

Yes, entering Conference USA is a major step for the program and I am glad it is receiving all these fitting rewards, but why are they being given to the team now? How about all the major goals recently reached, like winning three straight conference titles in 2001 and entering the "Sweet 16" level of the NCAA Tournament in 2003?

If I remember correctly, the only compensation the team received was a surprising announcement in Spring 2003 that the program would be cut due to the university's budgetary problems.

Even though the decision was quickly squashed, it still bothers me that more than three decades of sports history was on the verge of being eliminated.

Can any present compensation for the lack of appreciation the soccer team (and perhaps every other FIU sports program) has faced from the athletics department? 

In the end, it will be up to the players and fans to decide that.

I will still cheer for the team and marvel at the way it plays the universal sport of soccer, knowing that, unlike other teams, there is no need for flyers and parties and the best practice space to make  its games fun to watch.

Headline: DB almost misses out on football in college
Author: Gabriel Medina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Going to college is important to many because it grants the opportunity to lead the best life they possibly can. College isn't only for students seeking degrees in various fields, but also for aspiring athletes. 

Nick Turnbull, a defensive back for the Golden Panthers, is one of those athletes. A hometown boy, Turnbull is what many call an "all-around athlete." 

Throughout his life, Turnbull has tried his hands at baseball, basketball and, of course, football.

"I've always wanted to go to college to play football," said Turnbull, a native of South Florida. "It was my main desire growing up." 

While growing up in Miramar, Turnbull says that he and his friends would pretend they were the Miami Hurricanes of the late 1980s, the team in which defensive back coach Hurlie Brown was a part of.

When Turnbull graduated from Flanagan High School, he did not meet the academic requirements to earn an athletic scholarship. Turnbull was devastated and the signing deadline for college students had come and gone.

Earning an education after high school was important to Turnbull. His four older brothers were never granted a scholarship to attend college. When Turnbull learned that he was about to follow that same path, he admitted that he began to cry.

A call from head coach Don Strock changed everything, though.

"Coach Strock called me and told me what [requirements I had to meet],"  Turnbull said. "The fact that the head coach of a football team called me made me work even harder."

Not only has Turnbull earned an education in the classroom, but he has also earned one on the field.

"[Defensive backs coach Hurlie] Brown  has taught me so much," Turnbull said. "I would not know as much about my position as I do today if it weren't for him."

"Nick is an excellent athlete," said Strock of his starting cornerback this season. And it appears that Strock's gamble has paid off really well.

Turnbull holds the school records for interceptions, interception yards returned, passes broken up and is among the top five in tackles. He also has been named to the All-American team and All-Independent teams in his FIU career.

After his first season at FIU, Turnbull was pursued by Florida State University, Central Florida, Jacksonville, Colorado State and Boston College. However, feeling an overpowering sense of gratitude, he opted to remain at FIU instead of leaving to those other universities with longer histories and prestige as compared to the young FIU program. 

"Coach Strock was the one guy that helped me get into college in the first place," Turnbull said.

Throughout all the records and the success, Turnbull likes to look back on why he is where he is in the first place: Earning a college education.

Majoring in international relations, Turnbull will have something to fall back on in case he stops playing football in the future.

"Some people are lucky and are able to play football at the professional level," Strock said. "For those who aren't so lucky, they can always use the degrees that they earn to find a decent job. Even if you are able to play [football] professionally, many people retire around age 30, so a degree is necessary in order to keep working."

One thing that Strock and his staff emphasize is their athletes' education. 

Earning his education has opened so many opportunities that Turnbull has considered playing for the NFL if any team should pursue him. If not, he knows he has already accomplished something that none of his siblings before him have been able to accomplish -  a college education.

While some people have opportunities fall in their lap everyday, others go out of their way to make things happen.

"You have to work hard to get what you want," Turnbull said.

And a college education is one thing he has worked hard to earn.

Headline: Freedom at Last
Author: Jamie Blanco / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
We have been watching history in the making - Israeli soldiers and settlers, sobbing and crying as one is forced to pluck the other, kicking and screaming, from synagogue rooftops or lifelong homes.

They are overwhelmed, perhaps by the realization that years of struggling for control of these territories have been in vain - that generations born believing in their divine right over these "holy lands" must face the fact that those lands are not rightfully theirs.

The Israeli people have been hiding behind extreme religious zeal in order to justify their occupation, claiming they can reach a closer relationship with God by living on that land. But the truth is the same: Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem belong to Palestine. For some Palestinians the sight of Jewish homes crumbling is bittersweet: Knowing those families have been resettled and given greater wealth -  while their fallen homes symbolize the destruction of their lives.

With weak defenses, Palestinians were not only the victims of religiously inspired land - retention, but without support, they felt robbed of their right to defend their freedom against occupation.

Palestine's anger played out in suicide attacks; Israelis have retaliated and the bloody cycle has continued for the last five decades. Now the tides of hatred and bloodshed have been, for the moment, held at bay. 

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has opened up negotiations in the wake of  former President Yasser Arafat. Abbas, in an amazingly clever move, announced a complete and unconditional end to all violence, no matter how legitimate the reason, even if provoked by an Israeli attack. 

This is the best possible language Abbas could have used to gain support from Washington and Europe.  It demonstrates that any violence against them is unprovoked and condemnable. 

Abbas has also had to pacify the terrorist group Hamas, by setting a date for national elections. Hamas groups are hesitant to continue violence during the Gaza pullout for fear Israeli retaliation would hurt their candidates' chances. Elections are currently set for January 25.

The transparency of his national plan allows Israel no excuses, no direction to point fingers, removes obstacles and allows the peace process to happen. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has no choice but to acknowledge his nation's wrongs and return territory to the Palestinian authority. Together, it's working.

Palestinian flags flew in celebrations across the nation, promises of elections, more jobs and housing and increased mobility within recovered land give hope for the future, maybe even enough to pacify any future violence. 

The greatest mistake we can make in a region like the Middle East is to underestimate dissent groups. These are not "evil- doing, freedom haters," these are young men and women fighting to defend their families, culture, religion, nation and way of life.  Their loved ones are the ones who are dying, their land is what has been occupied by foreigners, and they are fighting for their freedom.

Freedom is not only the old "Red, White and Blue," it isn't only our kind of Democracy, it isn't only our morals. Everyone is equal. Who are we to say that our type of government is best?

We invaded a nation based on completely false pretenses, with the widespread belief that it would be a simple and quick takeover. These are relentless people motivated by the thought of protecting their family's children, homeland and their God against intruders.

What was supposed to be a "fast operation" is going into its third year, with 1,800 American casualties and countless more on the Iraqi side. As our enemies multiply they've attacked our allies, London falling victim to two transit bombings - the most fatal attacks in London since World War II.

But the U.S can learn from the Gaza withdrawal. We can learn from the mistakes and pitfalls of the past, despite how much blood has already been piled and tensions that still exist. With a thorough analysis of the job at hand, we can stop the bloodshed. We can give back what we had no business having our hands on in the first place. We can begin to investigate why we went to war on the basis of false information and we can learn the intricacies of a region built heavily on strict religious doctrine to find comprehensive solutions. 

But most importantly, we can begin pulling out our troops slowly, but completely out of the region as soon as possible. We also have the chance to make history.

Subheadline: Donations will go a long way to help those affected by the disaster caused by Hurricane Katrina in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Many are aware of the destruction Hurricane Katrina left in her wake here in South Florida, but some have yet to hear about the absolute chaos it caused in the states of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. 

Many people have been left without homes, some escaped from the disaster with only the clothes on their backs and still, more are feared dead. 80 percent of the city of New Orleans is covered in water, and in some places, the water is 20 feet deep. 50 people were killed in one Mississippi county alone.  

What the southeastern U.S. has suffered is being called one of the biggest natural disasters in the U.S. to date. We should consider ourselves lucky; most of us only spent a couple of days without electricity. Most of the people who used to live in New Orleans (it may be months before they can return home, if they still have one) don't even have clean drinking water. 

Sometimes we tend to ignore other people's plight, or at least not make any effort to help those who need it. 

Yes, Hurricane Katrina did seem to spare us, therefore we have no major problems, but that still doesn't change the fact that millions are in desperate need of help that many of us here in South Florida are capable of giving. We should do everything in our power to help that region of our country. 

Donating a few dollars, food supplies and clothes to a reputable charity organization associated with Hurricane Katrina can go a long way. If you find that you can't contribute to the cause in that way, at least educate your family and friends about the desperate situation up north. Someone is bound to have the resources needed to help. 

The key is to not ignore the situation. This is not something that will go away in a week. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will have to be dealt with for months, or even years to come. Floridians may have narrowly escaped this storm, but many others have not.

Headline: Dodging Responsibility
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The old saying "accidents happen" is far from intact in the world we live in. There is no longer such a thing as an accident, every adverse situation is malicious and, seemingly, someone else's fault. Not only can we eat what we want and blame the company serving the food for making us fat, but we can smoke three packs a day and blame the tobacco industry for making the tube out of our throat the only mechanism our body has to smoke with. It's actually pretty convenient. Basically, self-destruction is the new yoga.

The United Seniors Association is a Republican, nonprofit organization, who filed a lawsuit in August 2005 against the nation's largest tobacco companies. Though the first cigarette warning labels were printed on cigarette merchandise in 1965, there is no mention in the suit that mentions probable health problems linked to cancer and death due to warning labels. 

Instead, they argue that "tobacco companies hid the addictive nature of their product and sought to enhance addictiveness." Perhaps the addictive nature was hidden; hidden in the fact that these people were smoking three packs a day. That's totally ambiguous. The implication of their suit illustrates the knowledge of the negative affects the suffering ex-consumers had, but left out the addictive nature of the cigarettes. This is also known as selective memory.

Tobacco companies aren't the only scapegoat for the American public; fast food companies are too. In July 2002, a New York lawyer filed a lawsuit against four major fast food companies - including McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Wendy's - for causing his teenage clients to gain weight and develop serious health problems. Similar to the suit filed by the United Senior Association, attorney Samuel Hirsch also came up with a lame alibi. 

"We feel that the advertising strategies of quick-service chains target young children," Hirsch said. "Toy promotion and happy meals are a lethal combination." 

The teenagers between the ages of 13 and 19 also claimed that McDonald's used marketing practices, such as toy and value meal promotions, to entice its patrons to the food. 

So why don't we sue department stores for having sales and enticing us to shop? As role models encouraging personal responsibility, the teenagers' parents are either unemployed or on disability. Not to mention, Hirsch stated the teens ate at McDonald's almost every day for at least five years. If I had a law degree under my belt, I'd sue the deadbeat parents for attempting to kill their children. 

So where does personal responsibility end and social responsibility begin? Though I'd like to argue that personal responsibility never ends, arguing that one can be responsible for finding a finger in their Wendy's chili is inequitable. Nevertheless, personal responsibility stems beyond the kind of blame USA and Hirsch define. They are the reason we despise politics.   

In July 2005, the Center for Science in the Public Interest sent a petition to the Food and Drug Administration beseeching cigarette-style warning labels on soft drinks. Some label suggestions included, "To help protect your waistline and your teeth, consider drinking diet sodas or water" and "Drinking soft drinks instead of milk or calcium-fortified beverages may increase your risk of brittle bones (osteoporosis)." 

Though these labels may be helpful in warning people, it seems it would be more of a preventative measure in keeping a lawsuit from swelling out of the soft drink industry next. Either way, where do we draw the line? Do we then make a point to put a warning label on paper that may give us paper cuts and pictures that may cause emotional pain from seeing a long lost love? I pray I do not live to see that day.

Headline: Displaced students find FIU home
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
When Dione Carmona and Julio Enriquez Del Valle exchanged vows, promising to love each other for better or for worse, three weeks before Hurricane Katrina swept through their home in New Orleans, they never expected what occurred. 

"We left the night before the hurricane. We traveled east to Marianna, Florida, and we stayed in a hotel for two days," Carmona said.

Before checking into the hotel, the couple was forced to pre-pay for a three-day stay, a total of $270. When they decided to leave on the second day, the hotel refused to refund the remaining $90 balance.

"That's when we realized we couldn't go back. That's when we decided to travel to Miami where we knew some people and where we thought we could seek help," Carmona said. 

FIU and Professor Dawn Addy, the director of Labor Studies, have provided assistance by taking them in and providing them with clothes, shelter and an education.  

FIU has also donated six credit hours and has employed them at the university, so that they can continue to pursue their degrees, according to Del Valle.

"They've promised to continue helping us until we become financially stable," Carmona said. "And they've been helping us tremendously." 

Both were working for a tourism agency in New Orleans. Del Valle was pursuing a degree in electrical engineering at the University of New Orleans, and Carmona was majoring in business administration at Delgado Community College.

"We had jobs. We had a university. We had everything," Del Valle said.

The couple, who were married Aug. 2, have seen images of the damage caused in their neighborhood.

"When we got married, we moved to an apartment on the West Bank, which is now completely underwater," Del Valle said. "We've lost our beds, our clothes, our furniture; everything, but I never expected anyone to help us so much."  

Professor Addy has proven to be the help they were seeking for.

"Seeing the photos of the victims on T.V. and knowing that this is part of our community made me want to help," Addy said. "Here we sit with guest rooms vacant and these students come here and they have nothing because they left it all behind. I feel very lucky that it didn't happen to us here, and I feel that everyone needs to do their part."

Carmona felt relieved to know that she and her husband will have somewhere to go home to, at least temporarily. 

"She told us, 'don't worry, you're welcomed here, and tonight we're going to make a great dinner.' Now, we feel better because we have something, and this morning, we had nothing."  She said. 

The university has granted provisional admission for the Fall semester because universities in the affected areas are closed and students don't have access to official transcripts.

Carmen Brown, director of admissions at FIU, predicts this couple - along with a group of 125 displaced students now enrolled at FIU, and the group of 200 that is on its way - will be back home for the Spring semester.

"We'd like to help them get back to normalcy by the Spring [semester]," Brown said. "We need to work with the [affected universities] so that they can work with the students." 

But to FIU anthropologist Hugh Gladwin, the future of New Orleans looks glum.

"There are people who still have not recovered from Andrew, which hit South Florida 13 years ago," said Gladwin, "I say five years [until New Orleans returns to normalcy] as an average, but the Spring semester is pretty unrealistic ... now, it also depends on individual situations."

Carmona worries about her family's situation, but is hopeful that things will get back to normal. 

"My little sister was enrolled in grade school this morning, but my mom is still looking for work," Carmona said. "My step-father will be returning to New Orleans to work."

Although part of Del Valle's family remains in Cuba, the ones who remain in the affected areas on New Orleans are seeking refuge. 

"Some of my family members are still in Cuba, but I got a text message today that my [immediate] family [in New Orleans] will be heading to Texas," Del Valle said. 

The couple's friends evacuated to Houston, but communicating has been difficult. 

"We've been able to communicate with them through text messages, but that's expensive and sometimes ineffective," Carmona said. "We know that they're fine, but at the same time we know that they're homeless and unemployed." 

The couple, who fled the island less than five years ago with dreams of pursuing an education and a better life, can't compare this part of their lives to anything else.

"When I came from Cuba, things were similar, but it still doesn't compare. We made a choice to leave Cuba because everything was going to change [for the better], but this was unexpected," said Carmona.

Carmona's eyes water at the thought of the life she left behind.

"I left my wedding album. Every time I remember that I left my wedding album I feel infuriated ... even my wedding pictures are gone," she said.

Q. What are your plans to increase the student body at Biscayne Bay Campus?

The lunch plate on that campus is the Hospitality Management program. We will derive a significant additional funding for that program from the China venture. I expect that they will invest in enrollment, facilities and academic learning. We also have increased the arts and sciences and business offerings on that campus. I have worked with hospitality so that some of those business courses that are taught by hospitality are counted as business courses, so that people can get a good part of a business degree on that campus.

We expect that the Marine Biology, in time, will be a significant program.  We are building a tremendous building with all the modern laboratory advances to do research on that campus.

Q. Since the Nursing School has relocated to the University Park campus, there have been rumors that other schools are going to be moved. What is the truth to this?

We have no more plans. The move was to consolidate all the health services. Because we had biological sciences, health administration, occupational therapy, physical therapy and hopefully, not in the distant future, the medical school, all these pieces including public health connecting now, will make up a plate for medical students.

Q. Are there any plans to initiate new programs or schools at BBC? For example, students at UP have a pharmacy and students at BBC are not as fortunate. Will BBC students have the same benefits? 

Right now we are looking to see how we can economize in every area possible, so right now, expanding services at that campus is not a top priority. We have been hit in the last few years both to the niggardliness of the state as well as the impact of 9-11 on international students. That has really impacted our budget. Don't look for massive chances 'cause we just don't have the budget; if we did, we would do it.

Headline: University assists in Katrina relief effort
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
A crowd of nearly 300 students and parents from various southeastern universities gathered in the University Park's campus admissions office Sept. 1 for an improvised orientation session. Some of them were Florida residents formerly attending schools in such states as Louisiana or Texas; others were out-of-state students. 

All of them, though, had been affected by Hurricane Katrina, the category five storm that swept through states along the Gulf of Mexico Aug. 31, leaving them without a home or university to go back to.

"This has become a tragedy of immense proportions," said FIU Provost Mark Rosenberg. "It is in times like this that we must all come together. I am proud of the work that we will be doing to assist those who have been displaced."

Earlier this week, FIU administrators announced that the school would admit students from universities like Tulane and Loyola - closed down due to the hurricane's devastation - for the 2005 school year.

"As we saw the situation deteriorate in Louisiana, it was obvious we needed to come to the rescue," said Carmen Brown, director of undergraduate admissions.

Some students from those areas are expected to come to South Florida over the next few days, registering for courses through the admissions office before beginning their classes next week.

Around 125 students registered during the first orientation held at the Graham Center's new computer lab; 200 more are expected for another meeting to be held Sept. 6.

"The university's president and provost wanted to accommodate these students so they wouldn't lose their semester," Brown said. "It's a big effort, but one that will pay off."

Though various offices have been working overtime to aid the large number of newcomers, Brown admits there are still some challenges they will be facing.

The arriving students will receive a tuition waiver that will allow them to pay Florida resident fees instead of out-of-state expenses. However, Brown does not know what will happen to those who had already paid their institution's tuition.

"I know that money may be a problem, since parents who have already paid once may not like to pay for a university again," she said. "But I have no reason to believe that Tulane or Loyola won't reimburse all the tuition."

Another problem may be the availability of housing. The UP residence halls are currently filled to capacity, making it impossible for the students to live on that campus. Brown has nonetheless talked with Raul Moncarz, vice-provost for the Biscayne Bay Campus, who has stated that there may be some space available in BBC's Bay Vista housing for those students.

Brown also confirmed that there have been various faculty members and staff who have agreed to house incoming families.

"It's going to get worse before its gets any better. We need to have the university community aware that these people will be reaching out to us, and we can help them as much as we can," she said.

Despite the setbacks, there are still some who believe FIU, one of the first universities to begin admitting students displaced by the hurricane, has begun a noble effort.

"This is the most I've ever felt proud to have been a part of FIU," said Surgio Balsinde, who had once been a visiting student from Tulane.

Though Balsinde had wanted to continue his law education at the university, he was worried that the loss of his transcripts and academic records would prevent him from returning to FIU.

"I thought I wasn't going to be able to continue my education," he said. "But [College of Law Dean Leonard] Strickman sat down with me, heard my situation, and told me that he'd take me in with good faith, and that he trusted I had a good standing in my university."

This policy was soon adopted by the admissions office, which also accepted students without requiring transcripts, as well as relaxing issues of residency and immunization.

"I know that most students are in shock or in denial, but I'm sure that they have some relief now that someone cares about their education," Rosenberg said.

The provost also stated that, though the sudden influx may cause some difficulties during the first weeks of the semester, he believes that in the end, the positive results of the aid given will exceed whatever problems arise.

"We were also brushed by Katrina, and we still bounced back," he said. "Our freshman convocation was a success. We've been victimized ourselves in the past by hurricane Andrew, so we know what it is like to struggle back to the top. But I believe the FIU community can do it."

Balsinde, who will be joined by two other friends from Louisiana, appreciates the efforts to ensure the arrival of other affected students.

"I know that there are definitely more FIU fans now than there were a few weeks ago," he said. "All we can do now is see what happens."

In an e-mail to the university, president Modesto A. Maidique assured the FIU community that the school would continue to aid hurricane victims. 

"For those of you who want to volunteer, there will be many opportunities over the coming weeks where your participation will be most appreciated," Maidique said.

SGA is currently planning a concert festival patterned after the successful Live-Aid concerts. Oct. 8 has been tentatively selected as a possible date.

Headline: Trail of the Torch
Author:  Barbara Gonzalez / Contributing Writer 
&nbsp;
For the second time in FIU history, the Trail of the Torch took place on Wednesday, Aug. 31. 

The traditional event began last year by founder Bryon Tompkins, a senior and psychology major. 

"As everyone knows, the torch of knowledge is an important symbol to FIU. I noticed that the torch of knowledge by the Graham Center was never lit and decided something had to be done about it," said Tompkins. 

Tompkins decided to put together an event in which students, faculty and alumni came together to light the torch, which was established in 1972 in memory of the late Senator Ernest R. Graham and form a trail of light to place the torch by GC, and have it lit for that night. It became an event that symbolized the beginning of a new school year and it gave off a welcoming vibe to the incoming freshmen as well as the returning upperclassmen.

The event began Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the FIU stadium. There were performances by both the Lot 6 Dancers and the FIU Cheerleaders. The introduction to the event was given by Kimberly Cestillo, president of the Student Alumni Association and Tye Javellana, president of the Alumni Association.

"Knowledge is the driving force of the Panther", this was a line from a poem Richard Valdes wrote and read during the ceremony entitled "The Eye of the Golden Panther. There were speeches given by both the Student Government Association president, Alex Prado and the SGA vice-president, Christine Denton. 

"From last year, I think it was a tremendous improvement and I think it's something we can look forward to 20 years from now, said Prado. "It was a wonderful event and I think it's going to get better every year," Prado said.

The amount of guests expected to attend the event was 200, the turnout ended up being almost 600 people.

"It was a sea of students - it was awesome," said Prado.

Even though the crowd was so large, public safety made sure to keep everyone at the event safe.

 "The turn out this year was just magnificent. It was a great opportunity for FIU to show their loyalty and pride," said senior director of membership, Duane

Wiles.

After the performances and speeches at the stadium, everyone in attendance was given a lit candle and the trail began. 

"The candle that they were holding was more than just simply a candle, we are showing pride, making tradition, striving for knowledge and school spirit," Cestillo  said. 

The crowd walked through the housing quad to the GC. Director Greg Martin and the Golden Panther Marching Band gave it there all and performed at the stadium and throughout the trail as well. They made sure to keep the crowd alive. The trail of light, lead by the torch of knowledge, was a sight not to be missed. This event has definitely shown how it brings everyone at FIU closer together.

"It was my first time attending the event and it was really nice. It feels good to know that we are building a tradition here," said Danny Medina, a senior and criminal justice/business major.

After every great event there is always an after party. The after party for the Trail of the Torch event was a foam party in front of the Deuxieme Masion building.

It took place from 9:30 p.m. to midnight. "Many people attended the after-party. I really didn't think that many people were going to be there, but there were. It really felt like a nice welcoming for freshmen," said Alkin Cadet, a freshman and English major. 

The Trail of the Torch event is funded by the Student Government Association and by the Student Alumni Association. 

 "I know that at this event the spirit of tradition is alive. I hope that the event continues to draw student and becomes even greater, so that [same] I can feel that spirit of tradition when I return to the event as an alumni," said Tompkins.

Headline: Green says farewell, latin american program continues
Author: Chester Robards / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU lost another one of its professors to the retirement bug last month. Charles Green, director of the International Media Center, said goodbye to the School of Journalism and Mass Communication Aug. 3.

Professor Green began his career at FIU, managing and developing a study of journalism in South America.

"I believed enough in this project that I thought it would turn into something pretty big, so I sold my house and brought my family down," professor Green said. "The idea was to make journalism a little better in Latin America." 

As a result of Professor Green's study, FIU's Latin American Journalism Program took off. 

"FIU is better known among the Latin American press than here in the U.S.," Green said.

Throughout his 20 years at FIU, Green acted as director for the International Media Center in addition to teaching courses like computer assisted reporting, Feature Writing and in depth reporting. 

"I like to teach," he admits.

His teaching foundation was the result of 25 years as foreign correspondent and associated press bureau chief in Mexico and Venezuela. 

"I brought into the classroom my years at the A.P. If I got a new person into my bureau at the A.P., I'd expect them to produce, or I'd work with them until they could."

Professor Green's fondest memories of FIU are those of students whose lives he changed. 

"We've had an impact that goes way beyond anything I dreamed we would have," Green said. "I hired the right people."

During his time at the university, Professor Green has had overwhelming success with the Latin American Journalism Program. 

"Very few universities anywhere can say that they affected the lives of 8,000 people in 20 years," Green said about the program. 

Raul Moncarz, the university vice-provost, praises Green's success at SJMC.

"Professor Green has been one of the pillars in the building of FIU," Moncarz said. "He inspired students to go beyond the norm and to achieve excellence. Journalists in Latin America should be eternally grateful for all of his contributions." 

Green praises the university for its high academic standard throughout his tenure but says there now appears to be "less respect for high standard and more interest in high enrollment."

Professor Green's retirement plans include a log cabin on a lake - in the mountains of North Carolina - and, as an ordained pastor of 15 years, to carry on his ministry as he did in Miami.

"I'm hanging up the spurs. I'm gonna write in the morning, fish, then ride my motorcycle up and down the Blue Ridge Parkway in the afternoon."

Headline: Internships provide career opportunities
Subheadline: PART-ONE OF A TWO-PART SERIES
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Former fashion designer Helen Berggren now goes from door to door around the city of Miami Springs looking for stories to write.

Berggren, currently an FIU student majoring in Journalism, is going into her second year as an intern at The Miami Herald. She doesn't get paid, but she does the work and gets the experience of a full-time reporter. At times with double the zeal, she writes several articles a week for the newspaper's "Neighbors" section.

The 49-year-old wants to prove to counselors, professors and colleagues who've doubted her that she can do the job. She says her life experience has actually been an advantage in the business, along with her sense of initiative.   

"Experience has helped me bridge a communication gap with people," Berggren said. "And as far as initiative, women have to learn to stop waiting for permission to find a story and go out and do it."

To Claudia Reich, the Biscayne Bay director for Career Services, initiative is essential for students' success, no matter the field; they need to go out of the classroom and find ways to get experience before graduation.  

"Most employers we speak with," Reich said, "are interested in hiring students who've had two or three internships."

Reich says she can help. Students can go to her BBC office, at WUC 255, and ask for internship and job advice, as well as have their cover letters and resumes reviewed. 

Students can also sign up for the department's comprehensive online career-search service in the style of Monster.com, by paying a one-time $20 fee. The difference here is that members can connect with employers who are specifically looking for FIU students, Reich said;  offline, her staff refers resumes to employers who call in. 

David Udoff, majoring in studio arts, said he signed up with Career Services and has found it to be informative and capable of steering him in the right direction. But after doing a two-year photography internship with the city of Sunny Isles - in an effort to prove some buildings were historical patrimony and shouldn't be torn down - he's afraid his job-search will turn out disappointing.  

"Internships are idealized," Udoff said. "You're getting to explore new avenues, to find your talents, while being very optimistic about the job market. Finding a job with that same excitement is arduous."

Jon O'Neill, Miami Herald editor who's in charge of Berggren and the other "Neighbors" interns, says it's hard, indeed, to get the job you want - and at the newspaper, it's no different.

"Most people are going to have to leave," O'Neill said, explaining that many reporters now at The Herald have gone off to work in smaller newspapers or intern in other states before becoming attractive enough to be hired there. 

That was the case with Jennifer Mooney Piedra, 25. While interning with "Neighbors" in 2001, the then FIU student sent out 53 internship applications to newspapers around the country. 

"Most of the responses were rejections or otherwise non-responses," Piedra said, but she ended up getting five offers. 

The Denver Post had the winning bid, and she moved to Colorado for the summer of 2002. 

After that, she returned to The Herald as a desk clerk for the "Metro" section, going on to become a full-time reporter in February 2004.     

Piedra says she got much help from O'Neill as a mentor.

"His patience made a big difference," Piedra said.

O'Neill says she never once complained. But talent and a good attitude are not enough, according to O'Neill; students must find out what resources are available to them and learn how to market themselves or else they'll be swallowed by the fierce, savvy competition.

"Kids need to know more about the business of the business," O'Neill said. "If you don't do something to stand out, you might as well stay home."

And The Herald's Berggren keeps knocking on doors and making her overworked, underpaid way through her choice career. 

"Professors would ask, 'You're kind of vintage, are you sure you want to do this?'" said Berggren. "And I would reply, 'In my family, we work through our lives. This is the career I'm going to take into my 80s.'"

Headline: Campus offers cool hang-outs for all moods
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;

Welcome to FIU, your home away from home. As like any home, you will be spending the majority of your days here, so you better get to know the best places around campus that cater to your every need. Whether it is a late night stop to please your sweet tooth or a gazebo where you can spend those lazy afternoons, FIU has pretty much any thing you can think of. And if it doesn't, chances are it's under construction and will open next Fall.


Best place for a late-night snack: The Breezeway Café

Have a craving for the most delectable chocolate chip cookie to ever enter your mouth? Then the Breezeway Café, located in the housing quad, is where you must go. The cookies are little pieces of heaven, and unlike most of your college experiences, won't hurt your pocket. You can beat the late night munchies with only a dollar and get three cookies in return. Cookies aren't the only food the Breezeway offers. 

A deli and a pizzeria are also available, alongside a selection of refreshments, chips, candies and desserts. Late at night there doesn't seem to be much of a selection for food stops, so the Breezeway is always your safest bet for fast, cheap and tasty foods.


Best place to study: Green Library

Is it really hard to believe the best place to study would be the library? If you don't find a little cranny somewhere on its seven floors, then you don't deserve to pass whatever class you're studying for. Studying will prove more effective if you head for higher ground, though. 

Most students don't know that if you are in dire need of a study place, GL offers individual  rooms to  parties of two or more for a limit of three hours.

Witnessing the noise on the first floor is unbearable at times. The floor holds a Java City, a newly placed television and serves as the entrance and exit to the library, so there is high traffic of students daily.


Best place to simply hang out: Graham Center

The student union is the gateway to meet new people and have a bite during the day. Fraternities and sororities hold many rushing activities throughout the beginning of each semester and clubs including the Student Programming Council, Student Organizations Council and  The Beacon hold recruitment efforts to get new members. 

A game room can be found here where students gather to play dominoes or just play some arcade games. 
 
Food services including Subway, Pollo Tropical and Edy's Ice Cream are also located in GC. A lounge where you can find a grand piano to practice on is also located in GC, but be warned, the repetition of "My Heart will Go On" will get to you sooner or later. 


Best place to park: Lot 5 by the Wertheim Performing Arts Center

If most of your classes are around GC, then it pays off to park in Lot 5 rather than to take your chances in a garage where it's too dark to even see your own headlights. Besides, the time spent waiting by the elevator for the next victim to follow to their car can be spent taking a much needed walk from your car to class.


Best place to take a nap: The Bookstore

Who can resist dozing off on those big comfy chairs right by the windows? Even though students can see you sleeping from outside and the occasional "Look at that guy; he fell asleep" is heard, the Bookstore is the best place to take a nap between classes. Students inside the Bookstore respect each other's privacy and volume control is almost never a problem. Some might say the piano room in GC is the best place to take a nap, but when was the last time those couches were cleaned?


Best place to relax: Gazebo

Every college student needs a place to sit and watch innocent bystanders go by. The best place for this is any gazebo found around campus. The most enjoyable part of this is having a group of ducks come into the gazebo and scare you half to death. Ducks can be found almost everywhere on campus, in groups or as the occasional lone ranger, but hey, ducks need love too. If the thought of ducks appearing in your gazebo just doesn't sit right in your stomach, just put your feet up, put on some sunglasses and enjoy the Miami sun.

Headline: Veteran students share tips and tricks to university's policies
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
With the drone of the beach and the memories of the summer in the past, many students are once again readying themselves for the college routine of school and work, some for the very first time.

However, because many students try to balance their class schedule with a job or internship and a social life, some may find that they do not have enough time to fully devote themselves to their academic careers.

The Beacon has composed a list of tips and reminders to help students keep track of their  goals during the Fall and Spring semesters as they await the return of the summer break.



CLASS ATTENDANCE



Many first year students may be surprised by the relaxed attendance policies of some of their professors, especially after just having left the strict requirements of high school behind.

"I was surprised to hear that attendance was not mandatory on my first day of class," said freshman Valerie Hernandez. "My first thought was, 'Can teachers do that?'"

All schools and colleges within the university are allowed to regulate their own attendance procedures.

The English department's charter states that "a student can miss no more than six class meetings in a course that meets two days a week; no more than three in a course that meets once a week; and no more than ten in a class that meets three days a week."

However, it still maintains that "instructors may have additional attendance policies for their individual courses."

Most of FIU's programs follow these guidelines with teachers espousing their own rules in the syllabi they are required to hand out on the first days of class.

Still, the liberties given by some professors' attendance attitudes may prove more of a stumbling block than a blessing.



FORGIVENESS POLICY



One of the rules that distinguishes FIU from most  universities is the use of the forgiveness policy, a regulation that allows students to retake failed classes and substitute their old grade with a passing one, erasing the original mark from their GPA.

"The forgiveness policy saved me," said junior Steven Freichler. "I didn't do as well as I thought I had done in math, but I just used a policy, retook the class and was able to raise my grade average high enough to keep my scholarships."

Undergraduates have three forgiveness policies at their disposal while graduates only have two.

However, due to the limited amount of policies a student has available, they are often encouraged to find other ways to escape receiving a failing grade, like dropping a class.



THE CLAST



Florida students have been dealing with the College-Level Academic Skills Test - an achievement exam that measures students' attainment of college-level communication and mathematics skills - since 1984.

All undergraduate students must meet CLAST requirements by the time they have reached 55 - 60 semester hours. 

Despite the obligatory nature of the exam, many students still say they are not completely familiar with it.

"I only found out [about the test] when an advisor told me I needed to take it before I could register for more classes. I was shocked," Freichler said.

The university places a registration hold on students who have not taken the exam before reaching 96 semester hours. Transfer students with more than 36 credits must take the exam during their first semester at the university.

Students may be exempted from the CLAST rule if they have passed their SAT I verbal and quantitative sections with a score of 500 or more on each. Those who took the ACT must have a reading score of 22 and over and a 21 or higher in both English and math.

There are also combinations of English and math classes that can be taken as a substitute for the test. 

The CLAST costs $30, but is free if students register using PantherSoft.

Headline: West reinvents his sound in new album, Late Registration
Author: Andrew Kameka / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Kanye West is the most insecure artist in hip-hop. Sure, Kanye is often criticized for being arrogant, but that's just a front. People keep saying he and his tight polo shirts have no place in the "hoodie-and-Timbs" world of hip-hop. 

West is just using arrogance to mask his self-doubt. Now that he has unleashed Late Registration, no one can question the Chicago native's place in the industry.

College Dropout, the debut album that made West a star, changed the game in hip-hop. Producers - both new and old - began incorporating the chipmunk soul that gave the album such a unique feel. 

Late Registration will inspire them to emulate Kanye's style once again. 

The "Louis Vuitton Don" reinvented himself with the help of co-producer Jon Brion. 

He joined forces with the man who worked with alt-rock singer Fiona Apple and the results make them seem like natural allies. 

The odd couple delivers two of the album's best tracks, "Diamonds (From Sierra Leone)" and a second version featuring a retired Jay-Z. While West addresses his split from Dame Dash, he uses the remix as a chance to expose the "blood diamond" conflict throughout West Africa. The song has the potential to make consumers wonder who really pays the cost for their expensive jewelry. 

Late Registration shows the growth expected of an artist's second album. 

West has already made a Lebron James power move from amateur to premiere professional. West's music is now on a level foreign to contemporary hip-hop. 

The 16-bar verse, chorus-heavy standard of the genre has been replaced by dense orchestrations and even deeper lyrics. Breathe easy, Hov, your protégé, has the game in good standing.

West gets creative with "Crack Music," a song about how the Nino Brown generation has seen drugs become embedded in black life. 

Documenting the crack game/rap game mind set, West raps, "We invested in [crack], it's like we got Merrill-Lynched/And we been hanging from the same tree ever since/ Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine."

"Touch the Sky," the only song on Late Registration that West didn't produce, contains a beautiful combination of drums and horns, courtesy of Just Blaze, which accompany a tale of struggle with the record label that hesitantly gave him a deal. 

Three million records later, the Roc executives obviously made the right decision. 

Perfection is West's aim, but the mark is missed a few times on this album. 

Paul Wall's verse on "Drive Slow" sounds like a weak leftover from one of his many other odes to candy-painted cars. 

Though there are successful shots at comedy such as "Gold Digger," Late Registration also features songs like "Celebration." 

West once struggled to validate his place among hip-hop's elite, but he has silenced the doubters in the barbershops and on the corners of streets across America. 

West has gone from a dropout to the head of hip-hop's current class of MC's. Late Registration has proven that he is a student already qualified to teach.

Headline: Former American Idol contestant makes first album
Author: Michelle Santisteban / News Page Designer
&nbsp;
John Stevens's Red can put you straight to sleep, and no, I don't mean that as an insult. Frank Sinatra seems to be creeping his way back into this world using this strapping young man. 

Although all of the songs on the album are covers, Stevens comes through with elegance and grace. 

The romantic, relaxing melodies create a time machine that transcends one to a time where love was what drove a person's soul and ambition. 

If the stylings of Harry Connick Jr. or Nat King Cole tickle your interest, this album will most likely grab your attention. 

However, Red is definitely tailored for a specific genre and listener. So all you rappers and punks might not enjoy this album too much.

This American Idol always stood out from other jazz singers by establishing a more pop and bubble gum persona. 

Stevens took a separate path, one that led him to the past. Songs like "I Only Have Eyes for You" and "The Shadow of Your Smile" are true classics.

At only age 18, Stevens's voice resembles that of a 40-year-old man. 

He truly has the potential to have a successful future. Red is a good practice run for his abilities and how the public will react to him. 

I would not particularly say Stevens is better than Clay Aiken, but his choice of cover songs do set him aside from Aiken's young fan base. Aiken, as much we love him, just seems bland. 

However, there are certain tracks that are more appealing than others. "Come Fly with Me" was more tailored for Stevens' style than his strange, awkward cover of Maroon 5's "This Love." Had he stuck with the oldies, he would have been better off.  

Just as it Sinatra had covered The Rolling Stones, Stevens needs to accept the fact that he does not hold the qualities of a modern singer. 

Despite his talents, there is one problem with the album: there isn't one original song. As excellent as he performed all these great hits, I wish we could have had the privilege to hear at least one John Stevens original, not Dick Powell's. Furthermore, how long will this style keep him mainstream and successful in the music industry? 

While Red is a pleasant and enjoyable album, if Stevens decides to release another album, will it only contain more cover songs from this same period of musical history?

Overall, Stevens is still young and has many years to grow and reach his full capability and lasting potential. 

His first album should be considered, on a whole, an accomplishment worthy of pride. Perhaps, we will hear from him in the future, and we'll get to hear a bit of luck, with new original John Stevens songs.

Headline: Almost Famous
Subheadline: Student strives to win MC battle
Author:  Andrew Kameka / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
While most of his fellow peers at FIU were worried about surviving Hurricane Katrina, Samuel Donado was busy trying to make history. 

The junior, majoring in advertising, uses the alias "Parable" when rapping. He attempted to win the Scribble Jam MC battle, a feat no Floridian has ever accomplished.

Scribble Jam, an event held annually in Cincinnati, Ohio, has seen several noteworthy rappers enter the now infamous hip-hop competition. Eminem, Jin, Rhymefest, Juice and Slug (of the group Atmosphere) are just a few of the rap luminaries who have been tournament standouts. 

Donado arrived at the 2005 Scribble Jam ready to join that prestigious list and claim the $10,000 grand prize. 

The dreadlocked wonder was on a mission to remove the chip on each  of his shoulders caused by early defeats in 2001 and 2002.

"I must have out-of-towner's bad luck," Donado offered as an explanation for both first-round losses. "I was 15 and nervous, so I performed poorly [in 2001]. In 2002, the crowd felt I beat the other guy, but I guess the judges just weren't into my style."

After a self-imposed two-year hiatus from battling, the third time was unfortunately not the charm in 2005. 

Donado once again became an early casualty of the battle after a loss to Icon the Mic King. 

The first-round of Scribble Jam only gave contestants 30 seconds to impress the judges, which prevented the 19-year-old rapper from showcasing his counterattacking abilities. 

He walked off the massive stage of Annie's Night Club with dejection in his eyes.

"I'm big on rebuttals," Donado said. "Ask anyone about my style and they will say it's one of my strengths. Taking that away doesn't let me show what I'm capable of." 

Donado refuses to dwell on the setback, instead choosing to refocus his efforts toward erasing all of his flaws. 

The level of competition in the battle was so impressive that he now plans to practice everyday - without exception - in order to prepare for next year's Scribble Jam. 

"The [other contestants] were so good that they inspired me to make time to become a better MC. I want to get to the point where people will someday say that Parable inspired them," said Donado.

During his mental training for the 2006 Scribble Jam, Donado will also fight a battle of a different kind - earning respect for crafting quality music. 

Though Eminem has become a juggernaut of rap, other Scribble Jam participants have worn a scarlet letter of poor musicianship, often being stereotyped as inferior recording artists.

"Battle rappers automatically get that stigma, so there's a challenge to break away from it," Donado said confidently. "Your music has to meet or surpass the standards [set by listeners]."

Had Donado won the tournament, he would have attempted to do it by financing the projects of Soul What, the Miami-based hip-hop group that he has been a member of since 2000. 

The displeased MC was relegated to spectator instead of financier when Justice, a 21-year-old Australian, was crowned the 2005 Scribble Jam Champion.

Donado plans to aggressively attempt to make "Parable" a name associated with talent and supremacy. 

The determined rapper is confident in his newfound resilience. 

When asked what he will do if he wins Scribble Jam, Donado smiled and was diplomatically vague.

"I'm not at that point - yet. I'm just focused on reaching that level," he said.

In reference to the opinion article featured in tuesday's newspaper regarding American's and personal responsibility, although i see where the writer is coming from, I would have to strongly disagree with her point about cigarettes.  Especially in 1965, people did not know about the dangers of smoking, and even today, we still dont know everything that the tobacco companies put in cigarettes that make them more addictive. To not take pity on people who smoked 30 years ago and now have lung cancer is not only ignorant, but heartless.  To argue with the fact that tobacco companies are not responsible for luring people into cigarette smoking, and lying about all the poisons they put in those cigarettes is downright ridiculous.  The most corrupt industry in our country right now is the tobacco industry, it's literally a killer.  They lure people into something that kills them and markets it like something cool.
