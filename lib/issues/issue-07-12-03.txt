Headline: WORD CAMPAIGN: Angela posters market grammar test support
Author: Jason Benitez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU students who have seen her around campus know her dilemma: everything would have worked out perfectly, if only he hadn't said, "between you and I."  Angela just had to say no to bad grammar.

Angela isn't a student: she's a poster. The idea behind the Roy Liechtenstein inspired cartoon was devised by Allan Richards, chairman of the department of journalism and broadcasting, and Kate MacMillin, professor and faculty advisor of the Media on Demand program.

"We're talking about good grammar as a lifestyle; we're branding our program," MacMillin said. "Angela represents the students in the struggle to keep their standards high."

The concept leading to Angela came about when Richards wrote an article for the Miami Herald in April. 

"If language is your tool in [public relations] and journalism, wouldn't it be important to be good at it?" Richards said.

Expressing the need for greater attention to grammar, Richards cited in his article a grammatical mistake in the show "CSI: Miami." 

Richards noted that the character "H" used the phrase, "Between you and I" not once, but twice on the show within a two-week period. 

Angela's purpose was to design and market a fun way of letting students know about grammar test support, according to Richards. 

"On average, 40 percent [of Journalism students] pass the grammar test a year," said Richards.

Richards, with the support of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication's faculty and staff, has made great strides in providing grammar test support and crunch study sessions in the form of "grammar slammers" during his 10-year tenure at FIU.  

"People dread the grammar test, but I wanted to make it some fun," Richards said.

What began as a way of getting the word out about grammar test aid quickly evolved into a marketing campaign to promote the importance of language. 

David M. Berry, the SJMC's marketing coordinator, worked with Richards and McMillin in marketing Angela.

"We wanted to do a campaign against illiteracy," Berry said.  

Berry thought it would be a great idea to get the cartoon around campus using guerilla marketing techniques reminiscent of a New York aesthetic. 

Large boxes of Angela t-shirts in all sizes can be found in both Richards and McMillin's offices.

Students who walk through the courtyard of the Academic II building can see a large Angela poster hanging from the second floor.

Angela can even be found on the SJMC Web site under the grammar study materials.

Despite the campaign efforts, some students are uninspired by Angela.

"I don't think that would really help someone to take grammar test support", said Ahmad Alowaish, an advertising major. "She comes off as a know it all."

Regardless, Angela's campaign moves on at its own pace.

"Slowly but surely it is taking steam," Berry said. "It's a way of letting people all over the place know that literacy is an issue and that excellent writing skills are a great asset."

Headline: The Meaning of Life...a coulmn looking for the answers: Experiences define life
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
HOMER: What's the meaning of life?
GOD: Homer, I can't tell you that. You'll find out when you die.
HOMER: I can't wait that long!
GOD: You can't wait six months?
-"The Simpsons"



I was 4 years old and my mother heard me crying. She laid blankets on the floor next to my bed and held my hand until I fell asleep.

I spent prom night in a rented hotel room near Fort Lauderdale beach. The girls in the group took my clothes after we all went skinny-dipping. I read the Bible every night to my younger brothers when I was 10 years old; I saw my grandmother die when I was 16; my father once spanked me when he caught me watching an episode of "The Simpsons." I didn't kiss somebody until I was 18.

The memories come to me in no particular order. Some are clearer than others, some happier, some sadder. Details blur, incidents and names are mixed, or I'm surprised by sudden recollections of moments I'd thought I'd forgotten.

For the past year, I've been chronicling the memories of what I thought were interesting people in this column. But none of them could answer the article's main question: what's the meaning of life? A student who saw living as an adventure couldn't wait to embark on his next journey - going to war as a U.S. Air Force pilot. I reflected on the death of author Kurt Vonnegut, talked to a mother who felt her autistic son ruined her life, interviewed a friend who can't sing but still lives like a rock star and I made some personal observations on the Larry Craig scandal.

It'd be easier to say that life was meant to be lived, no more, no less, and leave the answer as vague and open-ended as possible. I could simply - that's nonsense. I didn't agree much with the way some of my subjects handled their lives - the depressed housewife who loved God more than her life and couldn't wait to die; an immigrant family who's biggest fear was losing their middle class comfort.But they shared their stories with me, and that fascinated me.

A memory is a story waiting to be told. Our lives are a string of stories, and when we die, we ourselves become stories.

Life isn't just about living; it's about what can be produced through that life.

Headline: Review: Contra 4  (Game)
Subheadline: Konami classic gets modernized
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Before there was Gunstar Heroes and Metal Slug, there was Contra, the father of the run-and-gun genre. The very mention of that name can invoke memories of teamwork and brutal difficulty.  Celebrating 20 years, Konami unleashes Contra 4 for Nintendo's portable DS in a package that oozes challenge and nostalgia.

Contra's story remains as simple as it's always been. Aliens invade Earth and you need to shoot them all. That's basically it.

Charged with devloping this Contra title is WayForward and it  has done its homework, no question about it.  The core mechanics are well intact: running and jumping on platforms to avoid death at almost every angle and collecting bigger guns to shoot with. This edition of Contra fills both screens to the brim with action and to accommodate this, a grappling hook allows players to ascend to the upper screen of the DS. Coupled with great control, Contra 4 retains the series' pick-up-and-play appeal. 

All the staple weapons, including the coveted Spread Gun, return in full force and as any Contra game should allow, two players with the game can take the bad guys head on.

Contra has always been famous for its difficulty and this one will not disappoint.  Easy mode is a good way for beginners to learn the ropes. However, only those brave enough to tackle normal or hard levels will see the final stages with the true ending. 

 As an extra incentive, challenge mode provides 40 exercises to test your skills. From Pacifism (no shooting of enemies) to timed stage runs, Challenge mode will push players to surpass their limits, separating casual players from the hardest of hardcore and serves as the means to unlock the cornucopia of bonus content. 

An interview with long-time series producer, Nobuya Nakazato, and NES emulations of the first two Contras are just the beginning. Sadly, the NES compilation lacks multiplayer capability, but is a nice treat for fans nevertheless.

Contra 4's graphics go for a retro approach. Retaining the look and feel of the eight and 16-bit eras, Contra 4 does a fine job of resurrecting classic stages like the jungle and old third person stages in old-school form while putting the DS's capabilities to good use with over-the-top moments fitting of a Contra title. 

Jake "Virt" Kaufman does a superb job of composing memorable tracks with remixes of classic tunes and new music to further Contra 4's enjoyment.

Konami and WayForward have blessed the faithful with a game worthy of the Contra name. Those eager to forge their gaming mettle or to get another chance to use the Konami code (as any self-respecting Contra fan should know) will find it all in this tribute to a time that is anything but forgotten.

Headline: Review: Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles (Game)
Subheadline: Latest in series misses the mark
Author: Kevin Castro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Resident Evil franchise splits into two categories: the original, more story driven survival games and the more action packed point and shoot games. While the shooting series has become quite popular in Japan, it is not so in the US. Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles (RE:UC), is a fusion of both styles. Light gun games tend to be unpopular. It would seem that a game like this would be about as welcomed as a drunk in a country club, but thanks to the Nintendo Wii all that has changed. The system's innovative controller, makes shooting games easier.

The Umbrella Chronicles details the events that led to the rise and fall of the Umbrella Corporation, the company that created the virus that turns people into zombies. Key parts of the Resident Evil prequel game, the first game, and the third in the series are recreated, nearly identical yet with better graphics. What is very disappointing about the plot of RE:UC is that it completely ignores the events and plot points of games two or four. 

The story arch is also expanded as you get to unlock extra files allowing you to play the series from the perspective of other famed RE characters, mainly Albert Wesker and Rebecca Chambers, giving you over 20 hours of gameplay.

After you finish each chapter of the game you are ranked on enemy hits and critical hits. The better the rank, the more points you are given to customize your weapons and new side chapters are unlocked. As you play the game you can also destroy elements in the game's environment. Doing so will reveal hidden weapons and secret files. These files unlock extra information on weapons, enemies and characters to give the player a better sense of the history of the game. RE:UC's biggest flaw is the critical hit system, as players can shoot a zombie five times in the face and it won't die. 

The bosses in RE:UC are extremely challenging, making the game seem impossible to beat at times. As seen in games like House of the Dead, in RE:UC you can blow a hole through the chest of an enemy and have peices of their arms fly off. This adds extra realism rarely seen in a game. Even with the high tech graphics, RE:UC fails to fully deliver as the weapon switching is tedious at best and your infinite ammo "pea-shooter" (pistol) does not help either.

Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles is the  best of the RE gun survival titles. For the hardcore fans beating RE:UC with 100 percent completion will require a bottle of Advil, as it is nearly impossible, as to unlock everything you require an "S" or "Super" ranking on every chapter. Even though it has considerable gameplay flaws, it still is a must have title for the Wii.

Headline: Review: Assassin's Creed (Game)
Subheadline: Rewriting the Third Crusade
Author: Kevin Castro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
From the fabled creator of the Rainbow Six series, Splinter Cell, and Prince of Persia, Ubisoft releases one of most highly anticipated titles in 2007, Assassin's Creed. In Assassin's Creed you play as an assassin named Altair. The year is 1191 A.D. and you are in the middle of the Third Crusade when you are ordered to steal a treasure and fail miserably. You are then stripped of your rank and forced to earn it once more. To do this, you must kill nine specific men. 

You have access to three of the cities in the Holy Land: Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus. Each city has three districts: poor, rich and middle. Each district contains one of the nine men you must kill. 

In order to assassinate these men, you must first gather evidence of their cruel nature as well as where and how to strike at them best. This has to be done for each of the nine men. To find out this crucial information, you can eavesdrop on important conversations, use violence to get information or even perform assassinations. 

The controls in the game are very simple to use. The button scheme is that of a puppet. The Y represents the head, X the weapon hand, etc. 

The way Altair climbs almost any surface and dashes across rooftops is truly astonishing and realistic. Altair scales the walls according to what he can grab on to and where he can place his feet.

You are given access to very few weapons, but that won't matter since the A.I. is so simple-minded that it is possible to taken on thirty at a time in battle and win. Once you unlock counter moves, all the fights seem pointless. 

Most of the fights you will get into are for saving persecuted citizens. After you kill the perpetrator, you get a reward in the form of access to either scholars or vigilantes; who grant you access to restricted areas and block the guard's way if they come after you.

However, you won't find any of these locations if you do not scale the city's staggering structures. 

These majestic edifices are the tallest in the land and will reveal an area of the map with all the objectives. To get down, Altair must make a leap of faith into a hiding spot.

Though Assassin's Creed performs majestically in many aspects, it fails in others. It is fun to kill the rich old villains, but the game gets very repetitive.

The game lacks in creativity; the side missions of flag collecting are dreary and unappealing. 

Assassin's Creed is worthy of playing but not buying. 

After you finish it once you will never play it again. Ever. Save some money and rent it instead.

Subheadline: Paxcon: Turning the tables on Pacman
Author: Ashlyn Toledo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's probably safe to assume that almost everyone has played Pacman at least once in their lives. Even those who are not usually drawn to video games have, at some point, found themselves frantically trying to escape a mob of colorful ghosts in a desperate attempt to feast on every last dot. Finally, the big, yellow, dot-loving circle will have his revenge. 

Pacxon is a game that turns the arcade classic, Pacman, upside down. The player still controls the iconic yellow circle but this time, instead of running away from the ghosts, your mission is to trap them in and conquer space on the board. You use the arrow pad to move around the grid and fill in space with blue squares. However, you must reach a previously conquered section of the board before the spaces will be permanently conquered and, if your trail is reached by a ghost before you complete a section, you will suffer the same consequence as running into a ghost yourself, the loss of a life.

There are several classes of ghosts, denoted by different colors, which behave differently and create different types of obstacles on the board. Pink ghosts bounce around the board, blue ghosts appear in conquered sections of the board, red ghosts reclaim conquered squares one at a time and tan ghosts patrol the borders of conquered sections. As you progress through the game, more and more of these ghosts will appear in different, increasingly more difficult combinations. 

Also, you will begin the game with considerable speed but as you progress you will become slower, making it more difficult to conquer large sections of the board at one time. 

To aid you in your quest for revenge, there are items very similar to those found in the original Pacman. A pair of cherries to give you a temporary burst of speed, a flashing yellow dot to make the ghosts edible, a bunch of bananas to slow the ghosts down for a while and a pink popsicle to briefly halt their movements can be found, giving you the perfect opportunity to box them in. 

Pacxon is an incredibly addictive, completely free flash game that can be found online on numerous flash game Web sites; www.mostplays.com, www.gamesolo.com and www.onemorelevel.com are just a few of the many sites that offer it. So before you start selling "unnecessary" organs to be able to afford Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty 4, do yourselves a favor, leave your spleen where it is and check out Pacxon online for free.

Headline: Crunch Time: Cram Jam adds movie to lineup of events
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
As the Fall semester draws to an end, students have begun cramming for those dreaded final exams. Junior Michel Medina has been studying for all seven of his exams since mid-November. 

"Finals usually involve no sleeping," Medina said.

In order to give students like Medina a break, the Student Government Council at University Park will once again be hosting Cram Jam on Dec. 10 from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Dec. 11 from 8:30 p.m. to midnight in the Graham Center.

"This event allows students a chance to take a break from their studies during finals week and really 'de-stress' in a fun atmosphere," said Nicole Cevallos, the SGC-UP academic affairs chairperson and coordinator for this semester's Cram Jam.  

One of the two main activities during the end of the semester event will be the return of the midnight breakfast on Dec. 10 at Fresh Food Company. 

Unlike previous years, the midnight breakfast will only happen the first night of Cram Jam. 

"I am very excited for Cram Jam this year because we decided to change the schedule a bit," Cevallos said. "Usually the midnight breakfast is served on both nights but this year we want to see how the students like the movie idea."

On Dec. 11 there will be a special screening of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, hosted by the Student Programming Council in GC room 140.

"We based the movie we're showing off [the SGC-UP's 80's theme]," said Eduardo Tremols, public relations coordinator for SPC. "It's a great opportunity to take a break."

The film will begin at 10 p.m. and before it starts, food will be served by the SGC-UP. 

"We just had to coordinate this like any other Friday movie," Tremols said. 

In addition to the breakfast and movie screening, there will be many giveaways for students to enjoy such as massages, food, memorabilia and the ever-so-important blue book that many students are required to use during exams.  

"One of the main goals this semester was to really focus on the needs of the students during this week," Cevallos said. 

Finals week begins Dec. 10 and lasts through Dec. 14, and the SGC-UP has arranged for extended hours in the Green Library and computer labs for students to study in. 

The extended hours for GL are as follows: Dec. 10 - 12, GL will be open from 7:30 a.m. until 4 a.m., Dec. 13 from 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. and Dec. 14 from 7:30 a.m. until 10 p.m. 

The first floor of GL will also be open 24 hours during the last week of classes Dec. 3 - Dec. 7. 

The GC computer labs will be open 24 hours Dec. 10 and will be open from 8 a.m. until 2 a.m. on Dec. 11 through Dec. 13. Dec. 14 they will be open from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. 

All Cram Jam activities will be open to any registered FIU student. 

In order to participate in the events and receive the giveaways, students must have their Panther ID handy.

 For those who do not have theirs, the PantherCard office will be open from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Dec. 10 and from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Dec. 11. The office will be selling duplicate IDs at a reduced price of $5.

Despite the giveaways and events, Medina is unsure if he will attend Cram Jam.

"I see it as a waste of time," Medina said. "You basically spend two hours talking, and if you're on a deadline you can't be doing that."

Even though Medina is unsure of Cram Jam's usefulness, the event has always drawn in a large number of students who want free stuff and a place to relax.

"I am very sure all the students will enjoy [it]," Cevallos said.

Visit the SGC-UP office in GC 211 for more Cram Jam information.

Headline: FIU 38, North Texas 19: GOING OUT WINNERS
Subheadline: Team breaks losing streak in OB's final college game
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For nine players, taking the field at the Orange Bowl, Dec. 1 would be their final chance at victory.

FIU's nine seniors, Audric Adger, Roland Clarke, Jeffrey Eugene, Cory Fleming, Anthony Guli, Kerry Guy, Zap Hawkins, Marcus Jones II and Lionell Singleton, were able to say goodbye to their teammates in the best way possible; a dominating, 38-19 victory over the University of North Texas, in the final college football game played at the Orange Bowl.

Players across the country saw their dreams of playing on college football's biggest stage fulfilled or crushed on this night. For seniors, there was only one goal: win. And they earned it.

Adger has seen his share of ups and downs in his five years with the team, battling injuries and being buried on the depth chart for much of his time until finally earning and holding the starting defensive end job for his entire senior season. But Saturday night's, contest, where he tied a school record with four sacks, was the type of performance that can erase any bad memories of a 23 -game losing streak.

Along with Adger's big day, Singleton had as big an impact as anyone, returning his 3rd career kickoff for a touchdown and picking up his first interception of the season in the third quarter. Unfortunately, his collegiate career ended earlier than it should have, as he was helped off the field following a leg injury. Despite his early exit, Singleton will be remembered as one of the team's most significant playmakers on special teams and defense.

Understandably, the rest of the team wanted nothing more than to give the seniors their one final win. 

"We had to get a win for the seniors," freshman wide receiver Marquise Rolle, who caught his first touchdown pass of his career, said. "Let's be the big dog for once."

The bond that builds between these players over the course of a season cannot be overstated and it is one of the things that make college sports more enjoyable than professional sports. The fact that FIU's younger players were able to step up their intensity for their teammate's speaks volumes of the strength of their bond.

Of course, the players, weren't the only ones with added intensity for the game. Head coach Mario Cristobal, who earned the first win of his career (as well as his first water cooler shower from his players), showed his enthusiasm throughout the night. 

While his first season as a head coach might have been disappointing for some, his enthusiasm for the game and his disappointment with losses shows why he is the right person to lead this young program.

In fact, the enduring image for me of this 1-11 season doesn't have anything to do with 40+ point losses or an empty Orange Bowl. The image I will remember from this season took place following Singleton's kickoff return for a touchdown. Cristobal was the first person to meet Singleton on the sidelines and celebrate with him, jumping up and bumping chests with his senior defensive back. 

Perhaps lost in the shuffle of senior night was sophomore quarterback Paul McCall's extremely impressive 11 of 19, 228 yard, 3 touchdown performance in his first start. 

I have to admit I've been arguably one of McCall's biggest skeptics this season, mostly because I simply didn't see him fitting into a system that requires a speedy, shifty quarterback. However, he impressed me quite a bit with his performance, hitting his receivers in stride and making some really tough throws in traffic. 

Something has to be said about the play of the receiving corps, which had a severe problem with dropping passes all season. But on this night, they seemingly brought in everything McCall threw at them. Speedy freshman running back Trenard Tunrner had one big catch of 58 yards for a touchdown and didn't have any of the problems catching the ball he had had earlier in the season.

While it is probably premature on my part, I'm going to go ahead and say this game is a sign of good things to come next year. With plenty of young talent, and Cristobal's second recruiting class coming in, I can't help but be excited about the possibilities next year brings. A new, state of the art stadium and a collection of returning talent points to a promising future for the team. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the team flirt with .500. 

And I'm not the only one who thinks this.

"It is absolutely amazing. It is great for our seniors. They went through so much." McCall said. "What losing streak? We're on a one-game winning streak."

Headline: GOING GREEN: Fad leads to eco-friendly actions
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The trademark, seasonal color red is feeling lonely this Christmas, possibly because this year it's all about 'going green.'

Indeed, going green is one of the biggest fads in recent history. That's right, it's just a fad: a temporary movement of something relatively trendy.  While it is more important than feeding your Tamagotchi or catching Pokemon, going green shows all the signs of being a popular trend with little staying power.

Saving the Earth is all the rage these days, as both individuals and institutions are working to lessen their carbon footprint - the impact one person has on global warming based on how much carbon dioxide he or she releases into the atmosphere through daily activities. 

Right here, at FIU, the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council's main focus this year has been on making BBC more eco-friendly.

"The environment is at the forefront of our goals," said Cassandra Andrade, SGC-BBC vice president.

For the past month or so Students for Environmental Action has set up recycling bins and has been handing out petitions at University Park. In front of the Green Library at UP is an unaesthetically pleasing mound of trash waiting to be recycled.

On the corporate level, the media giant NBC-Universal has started a major campaign called Green is Universal. The campaign entails the inclusion of environmentalist themes in NBC television shows, conservation at Universal theme parks and tips for going green on its new Web site, www.greenisuniversal.com.  

In "An Inconvenient Book" author Glenn Beck addresses some myths and deceptions regarding the hype surrounding global warming.  

Now, I'm not one to give more weight to a political pundit than established scientists on this issue, but Beck doesn't dispute facts such as how much the earth has warmed.  However, the way the information is presented is very compelling.  

For example, Beck points out the claim stated by EnergyStar, that if every household in the United States switched to eco-friendly light bulbs, it would be equivalent to, "removing 800,000 cars from the road." 

Sounds great at first, except 800,000 cars is less than 0.1 percent of vehicles worldwide, and cars only account for one-fifth of global carbon emissions anyway. 

According to a press release from his office, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels is using Santa Claus this holiday season to get the message out about the issue, including why families should use eco-friendly Christmas lights.

In a public letter to Santa, Nickels wrote, "It sounds like you had one doozy of a summer up in the North Pole, and quite frankly I'm worried. I read the stories about how the Arctic Sea ice [is shrinking]."

A study released by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Washington called the changes in the arctic ice caps were "cyclical" and rather than caused by global warming. The study is on JPL's government Web site, jpl.nasa.gov.

Some environmentalists have even gone as far as getting abortions to save the planet. 

The British news outlet, Daily Mail, reported Toni Vernelli, European campaign director for PETA ended her pregnancy and surgically became sterile to avoid having children who would continue to use the Earth's resources.

"Having children is selfish. It's all about maintaining your genetic line at the expense of the planet," Vernelli said.

Celebrity interest in the environment has become more popular also. According to USA Today, Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves and Alanis Morrissette are all currently working on documentary projects involving the issue of global warming.

Included is celebrity Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger who in 2005 mandated levels by which his state must reduce carbon emissions.  He also tailored his Hummer vehicles to be environmentally friendly.  

"I'd say the [global warming] debate is over.  We know the science," Schwarzenegger told the Associated Press. 

Debate is not over, however. Is our existence and technology the sole reason for global warming, or is there even such a thing as global warming? 

While it is agreeable that the planet's welfare should come before profit, there are those who question the way global warming numbers are presented.

In the early 90s, a slew of products, such as vegetable-friendly laundry detergent were marketed as "green," but there was no market at the time, according to an article from the archives of the National Business newsletter.  

Also, in the '70s, Time and Newsweek both ran pieces about scientists' fears that the Earth was actually cooling too greatly. In the end it's because of better scientific technology and more media exposure that's been the charm for this latest eco-movement fad.

Santa has already responded to Mayor Nickels' concern that his home will melt in the near future.   

In a press release from the Washington Policy Center, a think-tank that responded to the JPL report, Santa declared,"Ho, ho, ho! It is good to know that I will be safe at the North Pole for many years to come."

Headline: University increases safety efforts with new emergency calling system
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In the wake of the Virginia Tech shooting, which resulted in the deaths of 39 students, colleges nationwide have taken the initiative to improve security for their students. FIU has also made such efforts by initiating a three-phase effort to place telephones in every classroom. 

It is admirable that the administration has chosen to ameliorate the problem of University security by giving faculty and students ready access to public safety and other law enforcement entities. 

By taking these measures, University administration has proven that its commitment to the safety of the students is a top priority. 

The first phase of this emergency calling system is expected to be completed in late December, with phones being installed in 77 classrooms within Primera Casa and Graham Center at University Park, and the Academic I and II buildings at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

The entire process should be completed by the end of the Spring semester, according to FIU Emergency Management Coordinator Charles Cyrille.

The University is currently speculating over a means by which to send mass text messages in the instance of an emergency situation, or school cancellation. 

One of the options being considered is Miami-Dade county's emergency notification system, which alerts students of emergencies happening within county and at the University. 

This would be very convenient for commuter students who have to travel long distances, sometimes uncertain as to whether or not cancellation of classes has occurred. 

The fact that this expansion of the University's emergency response capacities is being undertaken with a grant awarded by the state, and not with students funds is also a relief, in consideration of impending tuition increases and other sky-high expenses for students. 

In lieu of this, however, some definite problems remain. The technical difficulties plaguing Public Safety's radio system has still not been rectified, impeding a great deal of coordination among the officers and potentially endangering students. 

The University should make every effort to correct this problem and avoid any potential crises that may emerge from it.

Otherwise, these changes are of the utmost benefit to faculty, staff and students, and they mark the beginning of FIU's transition to being a campus prepared for all emergency situations.

Switching to a Google-provided University e-mail system, classroom and Acquatic Center renovations and using Student Fees for financial aid were some of the topics discussed at the University-wide meeting held at University Park Nov. 29.

Marbely Hernandez, University Park's Student Government Association president, discussed the transition students will be making into the new Google e-mail, or Gmail, system by next Spring.

"After looking at different vendors, I think Gmail seemed to be the best for the students and would be easiest for University Technology Services to work with," Hernandez said. "A lot of the features that Gmail offers will make it easier to use [the FIU e-mails] and will make it better."

The current web mail system, Mirapoint, only stores 100 megabytes worth of e-mails. With the new Gmail system, which will be ready for use by the Spring, will give students three to five gigabytes worth of space. The new e-mail accounts will also allow for address books and links to FIU offices such as the Office of Financial Aid, Hernandez said.

Under her report, Hernandez also talked about the classroom renovations and upgrades she previously discussed with University Provost Ronald Berkman. The project is being overseen by UTS and Facilities Management in order to make sure all classes at UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus have the proper equipment to conduct class and do not have any structural damages.

"There are a lot of classes here that don't have what should be in a classroom and it's not always just the technology of it. I know UTS is working on that aspect of making sure that everything works efficiently," Hernandez said. 

The $1.3 million for this assessment was given to the University as a nonrecurring sum, or a one-time allocation, Hernandez said.

Besides classrooms, the BBC Aquatic Center might receive repairs if a new bill regarding the use of SGA's $4.1 million accumulated cash balance, funds accumulated over the years from organizations not using all of their annual appropriations, passes.

The bill will give both councils access to $200,000 for emergency use or special projects. 

The rest of the money - $3.9 million - will be under the control and supervision of Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs, and go toward the BBC Aquatic Center repairs and other buildings that may need repairs in the future, said Sergio Ibarra Bolanos, SGC-UP comptroller.

The final bill will be presented to Jones and council members from UP and BBC for approval sometime in January. 

"Since it's something very sensitive, Student Affairs will have a say in it. This bill is still going to give a lot of power to Dr. Jones," Ibarra Bolanos said.

Hernandez told both UP and BBC council members about the Board of Trustees' plan to give 30 percent from next Spring's 5 percent tuition increase to the Office of Financial Aid, as mentioned in the BOT meeting Nov. 16.

"A drastic number - about 80 percent - of students who come to FIU are on some sort of financial aid, whether it's a scholarship or a grant, and a lot of times these tuition increases are not expected and a lot of students worked hard to come to the University. Even though the state has given an increase, they are taking a part in helping students," Hernandez said.

The meeting did not end without discussing Athletics Partnership Proposal, an SGC-UP initiative that Arthur "AJ" Meyer, SGC-UP vice president, said would make athletic areas such as the Football Stadium and the Pharmed Arena more accessible to students. 

The Athletics Partnership Proposal will be open for student discussion at the next SGA forum Jan. 8 or 9, Meyer said.

Also, the SGA infrastructure renovations, which some SGC-BBC members believed were linked to the Athletics Partnership Proposal, was mentioned at the meeting.

Hernandez stressed that the SGA restructuring proposal will not involve disbanding the BBC council. Instead, Hernandez hopes to add more representatives for the University's colleges and schools in order to have more representation as a whole.

"If we had more positions available to go by the population of each college, I think it would be useful for SGA because more people would be involved in SGA," Hernandez said.

Katiana Saintable, SGC-BBC president, asked Meyer at the meeting what SGC-UP hopes to see out of the possible restructuring.

"You don't walk blindly into something and say 'whatever happens, happens' ... We still don't know what the problems and expectations you have identified are," Saintable said. "We want to reach a middle ground with this. 

If what we're doing is competing for certain things, it creates tension and that 'one University' facade will just be an illusion."

The next University-wide meeting will be held via phone conference Dec. 19.

Headline: PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION: Agency hired to collect unpaid fees
Author: Luis Valdez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In order to collect unpaid parking ticket fines, the Department of Parking and Transportation is resorting to the use of a collection agency. Unpaid tickets are turned over to the agency after 210 days. 

"The objective here is to enforce our parking regulations so that all of our customers have access to the product they have paid for, in an organized manner," said Bill Foster, director of the Department of Parking and Transportation.  

Following a state auditor's recommendations, the department has been using collection agencies since February 2006, but the use of these agencies was not formalized until this summer when the University approved a contract with NCO Financial Systems. 

NCO receives 25 percent of the outstanding debt they collect, while Parking and Transportation recieves the rest. Other than name and contact information, NCO does not receive any other personal information.

"We have to stay within the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices act. When we contact students through the phone and e-mail, we do it in a professional manner with a friendly tone," said John Adonnino, vice president of educational services for NCO. "You still need to respect them even though they owe our clients, FIU, money.

But when faculty member Richard Pabon received a total of three calls from the NCO, he said the tone on the other line was less than friendly. 

Two of the calls came to his home number and a third call came to his office. He also received several e-mails reminding him to pay his fine. 

"In the first call, the woman was very pushy. She kept insisting me to pay the ticket amount immediately," Pabon said. "I told her that I would pay it when I had to renew my decal on Nov. 1, like how I have always done it for the past several years, and she got very frustrated and hung up."

NCO feels that this is an effective method of making people pay their depts. 

"It really boils down to a third party to help the University. Being contacted by a third party helps students open their eyes to comply with the rules," Adonnino said.

Pabon feels the practice is unnecessary. 

"I feel that it is ridiculous that a collection agency is going after me for only $30," Pabon said.

According to Foster, all the money that is collected from parking tickets goes back into the Parking and Transportation accounts to help pay for improvements, safety and the construction of new parking areas and garages on campus.

Foster warns that students and faculty need to be aware of the possible consequences for not paying their tickets. 

"At this time we are not reporting outstanding tickets to the credit bureaus, but that is certainly something we can elect to do in the future," Foster said.

In addition to being aware of possible consequences of not paying overdue fines, Foster wants to clear misconceptions about the types of holds placed on students for parking tickets. 

 "A single parking ticket does not hold a student's registration. An outstanding ticket, however, does prevent students from receiving their diplomas and transcripts," Foster said.

Headline: BOUND FOR SPAIN: Crew sets sail to disprove Columbus was the first
Author: Andrew Leins / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Jose Valmana was working the rudder of a sailboat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean when it broke off from the rest of the boat. There he was, hundreds of miles from any dry land with no way to steer the boat.  

 "At that point I was a little worried," Valmana said. 

 Last summer, Jose "Joe" Valmana, 39, who graduated from FIU in 1999 with a bachelor's degree in history, was part of the crew of the Abora III, a boat made with reeds, according to an Egyptian design that is thousands of years old. Valmana and the crew planned to sail from New York to Spain to prove that ancient sailors could have crossed the ocean long before Columbus. 

 Valmana found out about the expedition in February 2007 and contacted the project's leader, Dominique Gorlitz, a German doctoral student in botany and experimental archaeology. 

Valmana spent two months in New Jersey during the spring preparing the boat for the journey.

"The expedition leader wanted to see if you could bond with the crew. His main criteria was a sense of humor and to be a team player," said Valmana. 

"[Valmana] was always kind and with [a good] sense of humor. This is a very important quality on a long-lasting expedition," Gorlitz said in an email.

 The ship, which was 40 feet long by 12 feet wide, was made with dried reeds tied together in big bundles. The boat's steering mechanisms were inspired by cave drawings that Gorlitz saw in Egypt. 

The reeds give the ship a remarkable ability to stay afloat. According to Valmana, it's "unsinkable." He helped build the cabins and the surface structures on the boat, but the hull was previously made in Bolivia by Aymara Indians. 

 As a diver, Valmana's job was to swim under the ship and tighten the ropes holding the reeds together. 

He also had to steer the ship and work the sail. 

The Abora III sailed from New York on July 11. For the first 10 days of the voyage, Valmana was seasick. He preferred being outside as opposed to being inside the little cabins. 

"I hated it when my shift was up and I had to go into that dark cabin. We had to sleep four people to a cabin; we had to lie like Egyptian mummies," Valmana said.

The crew was composed of nine Germans including two women, Valmana, who is half Cuban and half Slovakian, and a Norwegian named Tomrod Granheim. Granheim is a self-described 'professional adventurer' who once skied down Mt. Everest. 

 "We became almost like family, there was a great spirit of cooperation," Valmana said. 

On the days when there were no winds, the crew would spend free time going swimming, reading and talking about food. 

"Joe's a resourceful bloke, but very new to sailing, indeed. Even though he worked hard to adapt to the new environment, he never stopped smiling. We shared a common interest for food and cooked some of the best meals on board together," said Granheim. 

In August, the boat encountered several powerful storms and 18 feet waves, but it didn't bother the crew. 

It was the most exciting part of the trip, according to Valmana. 

"I knew that ship was unsinkable. The wind was howling and I could hear the waves banging against the ship. But [the crew] liked it. You could just bring down the sail and ride it." 

  The storms battered the ship and caused the stern to break off, but the Abora stayed afloat. 

A makeshift rudder was used to steer the ship for five days before it broke off in another storm.

"There were concerns for safety at that point, we had to send out a distress signal," Valmana said. 

The crew called in a ship to pick them up and they arrived in the Azores on Sept. 11. 

The Abora III sailed over 2000 nautical miles, coming within 550 miles of the Azores. Valmana's wife, Katia Valmana, worried about her husband because she had little contact with him.

"At first I thought he was crazy, but I'm glad he did it. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity," Katia said. 

He is writing a book about his experience on the ship. He's thinking about a humorous title about a Cuban rafter sailing the ocean. 

He currently works as a real estate and mortgage broker in Doral.

After spending two months at sea, Valmana was naturally relieved to reach the Azores, and solid ground. 

"The first time I smelled the earth, it smelled like rotten grass, but it was a great smell," Valmana said.

Funeral to be held Dec. 3 at Pharmed Arena:

The funeral for slain NFL player Sean Taylor will be held at the Pharmed Arena on Dec. 3 at 11 a.m. The funeral will be open to the public with limited seating.

Classes are being held as normally scheduled except those held in the Pharmed Arena, which have been relocated. The Panther Garage and Lot 10 are reserved for those expected to attend the service. Students and faculty should allow extra driving time and avoid the west side of campus, as traffic is expected to be heavy. 

Taylor, a 24-year-old Redskins safety, was shot in the leg in his Miami home on Nov 26 in what police believe to be a random burglary. Taylor died the next day from loss of blood.

The funeral was originally intended to take place at the University of Miami, Taylor's alma mater, but the BankUnited Center will be occupied through Tuesday with basketball games and preparation for a Republican presidential debate.

FIU receives $6.5 million grant for HIV/AIDS and drug abuse research among Latinos:
FIU's Center for Research on US Latinos HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse received a $6.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health continue research into HIV/AIDS and drug abuse among Latinos.

It is one of the largest grants the National Institutes of Health have ever given to FIU.

The center, known as CRUSADA, will use the five-year grant to expand its programs, which focus on prevention, treatment and studies of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse among South Florida Latinos.

Among the programs benefiting from the award are studies for developing intervention strategies for migrant workers and the development of better drug abuse and HIV/AIDS treatments for Latinos.

Money from the grant will help CRUSADA expand its "You Gotta Know/Hay Que Saber"? outreach program. Aimed primarily at young people, the awareness campaign included a survey that found many young people had little knowledge of the transmission methods for HIV/AIDS.

Headline: Football fiu 38, North texas 19: STREAK OVER
Subheadline: Quarterback earns win in first start
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The longest losing streak in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision was broken Dec. 1 as the Florida International University Golden Panthers (1-11) defeated the North Texas Mean Green (2-10) 38-19 in the final collegiate game to ever take place in the Orange Bowl.

As the game came to a close, first year coach Mario Cristobal could be seen celebrating and leaping on the sideline with his players. The only thing putting a stop to his elation was his players drenching him with the long-awaited watercooler.

"They are special guys, they are special people," Cristobal said. "We came to build something special and this is the beginning of it. Fortunately, we get to close down a special place."

Sophomore quarterback Paul McCall not only led the offense in ending the streak, but his performance may also have sparked a quarterback controversy between himself and redshirt freshman Wayne Younger. McCall guided the offense consistently, going 11-of-19 for 228 yards and three touchdowns, the most touchdowns thrown by a Golden Panthers' quarterback since 2005.

"I don't think you have a proven quarterback when you only win one game. But they have proven that both guys can compete," said Cristobal.

Senior defensive end Audric Adger, playing in the final college game of his career, made sure that his performance would be one for the record books. He tied former Golden Panthers defensive Antwan Barnes' record for sacks in a game, with four.

"It was the last game and you got to let it hang loose," Adger said. "It was awesome to win the last game here. It's something other teams couldn't do so we're proud to close this building the right way.''

Lionell Singleton, the much heralded kick returner and defensive back, clocked out his career with an inspiring 80-yard kickoff return, limping into the endzone after injuring his leg at the 50-yard line breaking away from two Mean Green defenders.

"I saw the hole opening up and I hit it as hard as I could," Singleton said.

The game started off on a sour note for FIU, who went three and out and proceeded to snap the ball over punter Chris Cook's head. North Texas plugged the ball in from the 1-yard line on the ensuing play but missed the extra point.

The Golden Panthers responded with a 22-yard touchdown run from Julian Reams after missing a field goal on the preceding drive. 

Micah Mosley of North Texas scored three minutes later, but that would be his only score of the night.

Giovanni Vizza, the true freshmen out of San Antonio, threw for 253 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.

After the Mosley touchdown, Singleton responded with his dash to the end zone and from there, the rout ensued.

McCall threw a 58-yard touchdown to Trenard Turner, followed by a 31-yard toss to Marquis Rolle.

Vizza came back with a 10 play, 70-yard drive capped off by a 7-yard touchdown to Brock Stickler, but McCall came back again with a 23-yard strike to Jeremy Dickens.

The scoring ended in the fourth quarter with a Dustin Rivest field goal, and the losing ended as the clock struck zero, concluding the final chapter in the Orange Bowl's long history.

Perhaps overshadowing the contest was the final collegiate game ever played at the Orange Bowl, and the Golden Panthers just may have taken away some of the attention.

"The Orange Bowl is a winner," said   athletic director Pete Garcia. "It deserves to go out with a win."

Headline: Women's BASKETBALL USF 84, FIU 56: Team loses leading rebounder in fifth loss
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Senior guard LaQuetta Ferguson's team-high 18 points could not lead the Golden Panthers to a win and stop the team's five-game losing streak.

The Golden Panthers (1-5) fell 84-56 to the University of South Florida Bulls (4-2) on Nov. 29 at the Pharmed Arena. Shantia Grace led the way for the Bulls with a career-high 29 points.

The game started with both teams hitting a 3-pointer, making a total 16 3-pointers at the end of the game, nine of which came from the Bulls. 

FIU led for the first few minutes of the game, until Grace started to pour it on with 18 points in the first 12 minutes of the game. 

Not to be outdone, Ferguson also found her zone, hitting her first three shots of the game, all from 3-point range.

FIU Junior forward Marquita Adley got off to a good start with seven points and three rebounds, until she fell and left the game with an injury to her right hand with five minutes to go in the first half. 

"She dislocated her thumb," said coach Cindy Russo. "They are going to do an X-ray [Nov. 30]. She tore a ligament for sure and I hope it's not fractured."

When Adley left the game FIU was only down 32-29. However, with their  best rebounder out, the Bulls saw red and went on a 14-2 run that would take them into halftime with a 46-31 lead.

The Golden Panthers started the second half with a 6-1 run, but the Bulls would answer it with consistent scoring.

 With Adley sidelined, freshman forward Liene Jekabsone stepped in to help FIU's inside game and would respond with a team-high seven rebounds in only 19 minutes of play. 

The game would come to an end with FIU giving up an 8-0 run to make the final score 84-56.

Following the game, coach Russo discussed the Golden Panthers' poor defense and the injury to Adley.

"Losing Marquita hurt a lot," coach Russo said. "I think we were down two when she went out, and she is a tremendous rebounder. I thought we gave up second shots and we were hurt on the boards."

Sophomore forward Elisa Carey  isalready sidelined by a knee injury. The additional loss of Adley means the team will be missing its two best rebounders.

"Those are things we can work on, like by putting bodies on them," Ciglar said. "It starts in practice. We realize that maybe we are not doing so good in practice. We are going to come back and start doing that and we are going to get better." 

"We are playing all freshmen inside right now," Russo said. 

Those freshmen are Jekabsone, Fanni Hutlassa and Maja Krajacic. Senior forward Jasmine Jenkins is also likely to assume. 

Junior guard Iva Ciglar managed to grab six rebounds to go along with 10 points and three assists. 

 After starting the season with a win, the team is now on a five-game losing streak.

The schedule has been tough as the five loses have all come to teams that made it to the NCAA or WNIT tournaments last season. 

 "Basically, we got to get better everyday in practice, go back to the drawing board and work on the little things and fundamentals," Ferguson said. "That's how we get better and start winning games"

FIU's next game will be played only nine miles from home as the team heads to Coral Gables to take on the University of Miami Hurricanes (3-3), who beat FIU last season 83-78. Ferguson led FIU with a then career-high 28 points in that game.

Headline: Men's BASKETBALL Robert morris 88, FIU 61: Outside shooting sinks Golden Panthers in blowout
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Much like a one-sided boxing match, every time the Golden Panthers threw a punch, the Robert Morris University Colonials countered with a flurry of debilitating strikes. 

Just when the FIU offense was about to gain momentum, the Colonials killed every run with an array of outside shots.

After winning their first two games, the FIU Golden Panthers (2-2) suffered their worst loss of the season, stumbling against the Robert Morris (3-2) 88-61 on Nov. 29 at the Pharmed Arena.

"Worst loss that I've had here in my four years of coaching here," said coach Sergio Rouco. "There was no energy to begin the game, no bounce, not the same energy we showed against South Florida."

For the second consecutive game, junior center Russell Hicks did not contribute much to the offense, scoring five points on 2-for-4 shooting. 

On the first possession of the game, Hicks received an entry pass and drew a foul as he posted up on 6-6 senior AJ Jackson. It looked as though Hicks would be much more active and productive than in the team's first loss of the season against USF. 

However, Hicks would go on to make just two more baskets for the remaining 39 minutes of the game.

"I think, overall, I need to try to post up harder. I have to come off the screen harder and if they don't see me, then I have to yell," Hicks said.

Coach Rouco explained why Hicks could not impact the outcome of the game.

"They swarmed him," he said. "We tried to force the ball to him when we shouldn't have. We've never played with a center before."

On defense, the seven-footer was helpless against the Colonials' speedy starting five, all of whom are listed at 6-6 and shorter. The Colonials used their speed to drain 12 3-pointers on 17 attempts.

In the first half, senior guard Tony Lee powered the Colonials' offense, slicing through the Golden Panthers defense. Lee scored three consecutive lay ups to extend the lead to 10 with nine minutes left in the half.

Junior guard Kenneth White sparked the Golden Panther fans with a 3-point shot to make the score 25-18.

On the ensuing possession, sophomore guard Jimmy Langhurst took the air out of the Pharmed Arena with a three of his own to keep the lead in double digits. 

Both teams played sloppy basketball, turning the ball 27 times in the first half.  Eight steals fueled the Golden Panthers offense as they scored 12 of their 25 first half points off turnovers, but the Colonials led 37-25 at the half.

Three minutes into the second half, the Colonials extended their lead to 20 by going on a 12-4 run consisting of four straight 3-pointers. The string of threes sunk the Golden Panthers and they would not be able to recuperate.

The team used a variety of defenses to try to cool down the Colonials' hot shooting.

"They shoot the heck out of the basketball," Rouco said. "We tried switching. We tried zone. We tried everything."

The visiting team shot 60.8 percent from the field and ended with a scorching 70.6 clip from 3-point distance. 

Lee led all players with 21 points on 8-for-12 shooting from the field and grabbing 11 rebounds. Langerhurst scored 19 points on a perfect 7-for-7 shooting performance, which included five 3-pointers.

Although Lee led the team in scoring, Langhurst made sure the Golden Panthers would not muster a comeback at any juncture in the game. 

With four minutes left, junior forward Alex Galindo made a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 14. Langhurst responded with two consecutive 3-pointers to once again take the crowd and players out of the game.

White led the Golden Panthers' offense for the second game in a row with 18 points on 6-for-11 shooting.

Galindo finished with 13 points on 5-for-8 shooting and sophomore guard Erick Nsangou scored 11 points. 

Offensive continuity has been missing for the team as no player has logged in more than five assists in the last two games against South Florida and Robert Morris.

The last two losses against formidable opponents is the first challenge in the Golden Panthers' young season.

"South Florida is better than us right now and Robert Morris is better than us right now, but not 20 somewhat points better than us," Rouco said.
