Headline: Mariel refugee embraces freedom 25 years later
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
This is part two of  a  two-part series on the 1980 Mariel boatlift and its effects on the South Florida community 25 years later.

Yami Moreno was only 13 years old in late September 1980, when Mariel, a five-month mass exodus from Cuba to South Florida, was coming to an end.  Since then, the event has dominated her thoughts.

"The only thing I can think of is that 13-year-old girl that got on the boat and saw the sun set on the horizon for the very first time, felt the fear of not knowing what was going to happen, being scared, throwing up the entire time [and] not understanding what the people were saying," said Moreno.

She spent 17 hours on a sea vessel she compares to slave ships of the early 1800s, traveling to South Florida with little knowledge of what to expect upon arrival.  

Moreno was part of a historic journey that brought some 125,000 Cubans to the United States when Fidel Castro opened the Port of Mariel in northern Cuba, west of Havana, to Cubans who wanted to leave their homeland.

 Moreno, who spent those five months in Cuba, arrived in South Florida with her twin sister, younger sister and parents. Upon arrival, education was her top concern. She graduated from FIU in 1987 with a bachelors degree in sociology and a 3.5 GPA.  

Even with high grades, Moreno and her twin sister didn't expect to attend the graduation ceremony. Money was still an issue, she said, but FIU stepped in to help.

"It came time for us to graduate, and we didn't have the means to do it.  [In high school], we didn't go to prom, Grad Nite, none of that," Moreno said.  "There was no money there. Time came for graduation, and we said we couldn't go. They kept telling us that we had to go, and [FIU] gave us the cap and gown.  It was more like an encouragement, letting us know it's OK; we've made it this far, and we can keep going. It gave us the push, [because] someone knew what we were doing was right."

Among those giving Moreno and her twin sister that encouragement was Uva de Aragón, associate director for FIU's Cuban Research Institute. At the time, she worked at the FIU Media Relations office and was looking for a good story to tell.

"We came across these twins and we found out they were Marielitas, and then we found out that they were graduating with very good grades. They told us they couldn't go [to graduation] because they couldn't afford to rent [the cap and gown], so we rented it for them," said de Aragón.

Moreno and her sister had positive experiences as Marielitas in Miami, but others weren't so lucky. Some reports show the unemployment rate was at a record high after the boatlift, and the increase in poverty made Miami one of the five poorest cities in the nation.  

This may have given Marielitos a bad reputation, but for de Aragón and her daughters, it was an insightful learning experience.

"My daughters were young. They started having classmates that had just arrived from Cuba.  So Cuba, instead of being a faraway memory, became alive by these people - their variety, their life stories, their courage, their dreams. It also taught me that [despite] the differences of having lived apart, there were many common ties," de Aragón said. 

Today, Moreno embraces those common ties, and as a social studies teacher at West Miami Middle School, she spends hours in the classroom ensuring that her students know the meaning of freedom.

While this chapter in history may be closed for Moreno, she always takes time to look back.

"Even to this day, if I have to do something and it's hard, I just tell myself, 'Marielita'," Moreno said. "That gives me the courage. It takes me back to that trip; it takes me back to what I went through, it takes me back to that 13-year-old that said, 'I'm a Marielita.' For us, Marielita is like [saying] 'You can do it.'"

Headline: Budget proposal threatens to eliminate college prep program
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
Taking the space formerly occupied by billiard tables and arcade machines in the University Park Porter Davis Game Room, Sofia Santiesteban and her small staff have filled the limited area with papers, boxes, books and a load of material belonging to the Upward Bound program.

"We've been moved around, but that's not a problem," said Santiesteban. "It may seem like a mess, but I'm going to miss it when it's all gone."

According to Santiesteban, director of the pre-collegiate Upward Bound Program, chances are that the staff won't be working, either at the improvised office or at any other part of campus much longer.

"The program is in trouble, I'm not going to deny that. If the federal budget proposal is approved, there won't be much we can do," Santiesteban said.

Upward Bound, along with the Talent Search initiative based at the Biscayne Bay Campus, is part of the 40-year-old TRIO federal program, aimed at helping low income urban students pass through high school and get into college.

Both programs were targeted for elimination after President George W. Bush made a cut in his Department of Education budget proposal for the 2006 fiscal year.

"There's no way of knowing exactly why these cuts are being made," said George Simms, director of pre-collegiate programs and grants.

Though TRIO has existed since the Lyndon Johnson administration, Simms believes one reason for the cuts may be Bush's efforts to redirect funds and personnel toward the No Child Left Behind initiative, a test-based educational program begun in 2002.

"I can see the merits of the new program, but it has only been around for three years. There are many other resources out there that have been around for a while and have proven to be effective, and they may be suffering soon," Simms said.

But Bush's decision to slash the TRIO budget was based on data accumulated by the Office of Management and Budgets which grades the effectiveness of federal agencies and programs.

In its yearly ranking assessment, Talent Search received a Results Not Demonstrated rating which according to the report, is "due to a lack of data of key performance measures." 

Upward Bound was marked with an Ineffective rating because "evaluation results ... found the program has limited overall impact" on higher risk students.

Others, however, believe the programs have been successful.

The Council for Opportunity in Education, a nonprofit organization that works with pre-collegiate programs around the nation, countered these results with their own study and argued that TRIO has helped an estimated 2.2 million students graduate from college and has served nearly 873,000 students, two-thirds of whom come from families with incomes less than $24,000.

There are currently 2,700 TRIO programs around the nation, with an estimated 700 students in the FIU branches alone.

Wilnise Jannitch and Rose-Lourdes Pierre, high school sophomores participating in the BBC Talent Search, disagreed with the report and said the program has been a great help to them.

"I've been doing this since eighth grade and I love it," said Jannitch. "Here, I get to talk to my tutors one-on-one and they're there to help me with whatever problem I need, especially during test times. I couldn't have gotten where I am now without it."

Jammitch and Pierre have been enrolled in the program since it was established at BBC three years ago.

"In my high school, there aren't opportunities like this. If it's gone, there's nowhere else I can go to," said Pierre.

Though the budget proposal has already been submitted, legislators who disagreed with Bush's decision have been working since March to prevent the elimination of the programs.

Congressmen Tom Cole and Donald Payne passed a petition last month endorsing the restoration of and increasing funds to TRIO. The bipartisan petition has been endorsed by Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy and includes the signatures of Florida State Representatives Jim Davis, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Robert Wexler and Corrine Brown.

According to the directors of the FIU programs, the only way to ensure the continuation of TRIO is for citizens to write letters to their representatives, expressing their interest in the survival of the program.

"I don't personally care what happens to my job," said Elena Cruz, associate director for Talent Search. "My concern is for the kids who won't have these opportunities at their disposal. There's got to be a way for us to merge the old programs with the new."

Frat house in full operation

After 10 years of fundraising and 10 months of construction, the Pi Kappa Alpha house, with its high stairs and four large columns leading to the main doors, is open and has been running smoothly since January.

According to Bijan Enferadi, international vice president and house manager, the house cost $1.7 million dollars.

It will take many ways to collect the house costs.

"The house will be supported by the rent the members pay, continued fundraising by the members, and the plethora of donations we receive from our local alumni," said Enferadi.  

Modeled after their international headquarters, the  two story house features 19 bedrooms, a living room with a big screen television, couches and a foosball table. 

Out of the 19 bedrooms, 13 are double rooms, while the other five are single rooms. Double room members pay $2,100 per semester and single room members pay $3,000.

The house features two bathrooms, with one located upstairs for women. The brothers have a bathroom downstairs equipped with five sinks, six bathrooms stalls (including a handicapped one), three urinals, a locker room and a community shower, which has six showerheads. 

According to Enferadi, the house follows strict university guidelines. 

"If you are to possess alcohol you must be 21 years or older, and alcohol may only be in your room," Enferadi said.  

Members of the fraternity try to keep their doors open and welcome anyone who wishes to visit the house.

"We're really nice about giving people tours of the Pike house," said member David Acosta. 

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity is an international fraternity dating back to March 1, 1868.  It was first established at FIU on May 21, 1994.

German Cardinal Ratzinger elected as pope

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, 78, was elected new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, April 19. It was officially announced to a cheering crowd from a window at St. Peter's Square in Rome.

"The fact that the Lord can work and act even with insufficient means consoles me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers," said Ratzinger after taking the name Benedict XVI.

Ratzinger, the former leader of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (the Church's orthodoxy watchdog), is known as a Vatican hard-liner and traditionalist, responsible for enforcing many of the former Pope John Paul II's more conservative teachings.

He was the cardinal with the highest support before the start of the conclave, seen by many as a transitional choice after the long reign of the popular John Paul.

The announcement, heralded by a plume of white smoke from the Sistine Chapel and the ringing of Vatican church bells, came after the fourth round of votes in two days.

Ratzinger is the first Germanic pontiff since the reign of Pope Victor II in the 11th century.

Headline: New record shop supplies indie to Miami
Author: John Lovell / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Going to Sweat Records is like visiting the candy store. You are greeted as you enter, and the shop suddenly becomes a big playground of fun. All types of candy line the walls, in every different kind of flavor and from all over the world. It never ends! Candy everywhere, and you want every last bit of it.

Sweat Records is the newest addition to Miami's progressive community of music-lovers. Miami-native Lauren Reskin, 22, co-owner, has seen it coming. She was there, DJing five years ago when words like "Poplife" and "Revolver" were just beginning to find a place in Miami's weekend vocabulary. She was there, two years ago promoting a nightclub called Vice, Revolver's short-lived but well-loved sister, specializing in '80s music. Armed with a super-keen knowledge of music, a law student friend with a nose for business and years of record-selling experience as a Virgin Records Megastore employee, Reskin has fulfilled a long time dream shared by so many in this community (and has done it all in just 10 months).

"My best friend Sara [Yousuf, co-owner] and I were tossing the idea around. It was something I always wanted to do but didn't really think I'd be able to accomplish until I was later on in life," said Reskin. "And then we just got the opportunity. We decided to start doing some research, and it started becoming more than something we were just talking about; it started becoming this real thing we were actually going to do."

After a little less than a year of planning and painting and promoting, Sweat Records opened,  March 12 at 2320 N.W. 2nd Ave. in Wynwood - a bustling new art district in downtown Miami. By offering a selection of new and used music unlike any other record store in South Florida, Reskin is stepping into uncharted territory. But the new music keeps coming in, along with new customers - some curious, some drooling (that's me). Obscure artists like The Olivia Tremor Control and The Microphones sit next to more popular, buzzing groups like Interpol and M.I.A. on the main racks, and in the back room there are sections of new and used CDs and vinyl records. Check out the used vinyl and you'll find '70s and '80s favorites like Donna Summer's Bad Girls and Prince's 1999. 

Sweat Records is committed to a community of friends, many of whom poured their time and energy into opening the store, working hard and getting paid with pizza parties. It's just that kind of friendly family vibe that sets Sweat Records apart from other stores - that, and the fantastic selection of music.

"People seem to be coming in and buying good stuff. We write down everything people buy, so I think [we're] going to bring better music to a larger audience," said Matt Cash, Sweat Records employee and local DJ. "That's a good feeling. People walk into the store and say, 'Oh my gosh, I haven't been able to find this anywhere.' It's very fulfilling."

Scenester nightclubs like Poplife, that specialize in playing alternative or indie music, have been setting the stage, so to speak, keeping a steady flow of new ideas and experiences of music fresh in people's minds. For years, these clubs have given Miami an alternative touch and Sweat Records fits right in.

"I get to see that it's all totally connected," Cash said.  "I DJ at Poplife and I work here. People come up and ask me [in the club] what I'm playing, and I'll tell them 'I'm playing this. Come to the store and you can buy it if you want.'"

Considering the growing popularity of Poplife and other similar clubs like Revolver, this year could not have been a more opportune moment for Reskin and friends to make Sweat happen.

 "When I travel, the first thing I go to is the record store," said Reskin. "I felt like it was really important to do this because someone comes to visit me in Miami and they're like 'Oh, where's the quality record store?' and I have to say 'There isn't one' and that's embarrassing!"

Sweat Records goes beyond the typical record shop, sporting a community DJ booth with equipment set up so that anyone can sign up to spin music and invite their friends to shop and listen - given they don't play anything too mainstream. Expect to see small concerts happening in the store as well. On May 2, Sweat will host a $4 concert with Moldy Peaches singer Kimya Dawson.

"We wanted to make it really comfy. We're getting some more couches in soon," said Reskin. "We've got wireless Internet so people can come and surf, and they can also surf our iTunes, which we upload all of our promos and stuff onto, so it's a big bring-your-own-listening-station sort of thing - refreshing and cute."

So what's in store for the future of Sweat Records? Reskin isn't going anywhere. On the horizon, she sees the possibility of starting a record label, a venue/restaurant and late-night establishments. Who knows what's likely to happen next?

Are indie record stores going to inspire a musical revolution? The answers are inside the shop, in the music section. If you take a moment and really listen to the current of energy that flows through a place like Sweat Records, you'll find there's a new cultural identity just itching to crawl out from under the Miami streets.

Headline: Alumnus filmmaker debuts work at Amika Lounge
Author: Sherise James / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Who is Justin Routt? The Palm Beach Post called him "The New Tarantino," The Miami Herald called him "The Ultimate Indie" and The Sun-Sentinel said that "enthusiasm and hope drive [this] independent filmmaker." 

But really, who is he? Justin Routt is a talented local independent filmmaker who not only writes and produces, but he creates and owns the independent film company Birch Creek Films. 

The driven Routt has already created six full-length feature films, which are ready to be produced and their funding is just pending. 

Routt looks to many local talent agencies and theater groups for talent for his films. Many hopefuls join the list waiting for a break, but as Routt told "Deco Drive," he knows the keys to success in his business: a great script, good talent, an experienced film crew, distribution and lots of good publicity. 

When it comes to getting publicity, this filmmaker is no rookie. "Deco Drive" (April 15, 2005), Movie Maker MagazineFortune Magazine and The Miami Herald are just a few media venues that have bent an ear to hear what Routt/Birch Creek Films had to say. 

His short film "Clear Cut" was a phenomenal success, selling out at the Palm Beach Film Festival and earning him first place at the festival for best actor. April 14, the up-and-coming filmmaker premiered his new films "Alternate Paths" and "Killer Coffee" at Amika Lounge. 

"'Killer Coffee' is a comedy about a klutzy grim reaper that is late for his intended victim. 'Alternate Paths' is a short [film] about a woman who takes a shortcut home from shopping and is stalked by a psycho," Routt explained before the show. 

The plush club set the perfect tone for a night of celebration for the FIU alumnus' success. Guests enjoyed complimentary drinks and sushi as a thank you for their support. 

"It was refreshing to see such a good turn out so early in the evening, by South Beach standards," said Elliot Sklar. 

Producers, local filmmakers, models, actors and representatives of major advertising agencies, such as Crispin Porter, Hunter Hammersmith and a number of other top advertising and public relations agencies, attended the event, which made it a great place for networking. 

This was the fifth independent film night Routt has hosted, and he plans on throwing these events in the future to spotlight his and other indie films; anyone who wishes to attend is welcome to  drink, network and watch the movies for free. The next event will be around the third week of May, 2005.

Headline: Big names to perform at Panther Stock show
Author: Stephanie Machado / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If your typical Saturday morning involves sitting at home and flipping through channels in desperate hopes to catch a rerun of "Gilmore Girls," then it's time to get out of your pjs, because on April 23 Panther Stock 2005 will be here.

SPC representatives have been working tirelessly for weeks putting together this exciting event for the FIU community

The all-day festival will include Hip Hop, Rock, Electronic and comedic performances. 

Taking place at Parking Lot 5 by the University Park Pharmed Arena, doors will open promptly at noon and tickets will cost $10 for General Admission or $5 in advance with FIU I.D. 

Panther Stock has something for everyone: DJ Ideal, The Illiterats and Soul What? are only a few of the hip-hop groups performing. 

If crotch-grabbing rap artists isn't your thing, worry not, local rock bands such as Day Music Died and Audible will also be playing, along with Grammy Award winning artists Locos Por Juana.

Along with providing quality musical entertainment, Panther Stock 2005 may be the beginning of an FIU legacy. 

Concert Chairperson Frank Perez, said he hopes to have Panther Stock again next year and years after. "We want people to think of FIU's Panther Stock as they do UF's Gator Growl," said Perez. 

Panther Stock 2005 is not your typical FIU show. Along with having big name artists, such as Lloyd Banks and Young Buck from G-Unit and comedian Dean Edwards from "Saturday Night Live," Panther Stock has really been a labor of love for the students involved. 

"This is the biggest event ever to be completely programmed by students," said Perez. "People really believe in this cause."

 The cause, of course, is FIU's Dance Marathon, benefiting Children's Miracle Network of Miami Children's Hospital. All proceeds of Panther Stock go to Dance Marathon, which is FIU's largest charitable event. Hopefully after this year's event, Panther Stock will give it a run for its money.

Headline: Metal Faced Doom pleases with live album
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Who steps on stage ready for a show and rocks a flow on the microphone that leaves all  emcees dribbling from their nose?

This task of clobbering trifling emcees is all in a day's work for the Metal Faced Doom, as he makes his newest invasion on, Live from Planet X (Nature Sounds/Metal Face Recordings, 2005)." 

The album was recorded live in the San Francisco/Oakland Bay area. Doom fans that are into technically deciphering his music will be happy to know that the album was recorded from the sound board as opposed to being recorded from a cassette recorder. This ensures full vocal and beat clarity that blasts through the stereo. Doom performs tracks from his extensive catalogue as far back as one's metal fingers will reach.

As the DJ began to cut the wax, the classic, "Operation Doomsday Intro", opens the show. An enthusiastic Doom appears just as amped as the crowd, while he begins rhyming, "Change the Beat."

Known as a supreme word-smith, Doom flips words and phrases at the drop of a hat.

They ain't got s**t to say like Timothy McVeigh/

Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch/

He carried a doo-rag in a bag lunch/

Just to eat heads on some break dance s**t and spit/

He ripped this skit in sand script/

The second track, "Name Droppers", is one of several Doom rarities. It originally appeared on the Best of MF Doom and MF Grimm. It is unknown if it is a real album or a bootleg, but its "Annie" inspired beat will have listeners slapping their knees as Doom spits quirky rhymes.

The interesting thing about the track is that random sample cuts of what appear to be rooters squawking fades in and out.

Several things can make or break a live album. Fans often have a fondness for singing or rhyming along to their favorite song with the artists. That is not the annoying part.  It all goes to hell when fans feel the need to senselessly yell into the microphone as on, "Rhymes like Dimes."

The second thing that can make or break a live album is the production editing. Listeners will chuckle as Doom re-starts, "Go with the Drawls," after losing flow halfway through.

You may notice that the CD player reads as only "track 1," throughout the entire show.  Well, it is in fact only one continuous track that runs for 50 minutes.  Listeners will be forced to fast-forward to their favorite cuts.  

Doom Heads will be familiar with the track, "I hear Voices," but only the serious ones know about the MF Grimm response in, "I hear voices prt.2."  

The title cut, "Operation Doomsday," has to appear on the cd. Don't even doubt it for a second.  

The mysterious Scooby-Doo inspired, "Hey," sends chills up your spine, but is nothing compared to the Doom rarity, "My Favorite Ladies." This track was only released on 12", but the video can be downloaded via the Internet.

While using "Guerilla-style" filming, the mysterious Doom journeys throughout the city rhyming about his bevy of female companions.

Doom really out did himself on this release.  He reassures all of the fans that were not dissatisfied with MM Food, that he is still the illest emcee on the mic.

The only downsides to the album were that it was only one track, and that it was only 50 minutes long.  These are small prices to pay for a live Doom recording.  It's better than competing to bid on a live Doom show from Amsterdam on E-bay.

It also gives all those who have yet to see Doom perform live a chance to hear what they have yet to experience.

Headline: Artists and photographers show off their work at this annual exhibit
Subheadline: BFA - 2005
Author: Michelle Santisteban/Sports Page Designer
&nbsp;
Art is a reflection of its creator's soul. Passion, rage or inspirations are what lie underneath a painting, photograph or sculpture. Brushstrokes and snapshots are only words, but when put into action, they create masterpieces that may change a person's life forever. 

 The BFA Spring 2005 exhibition was presented at the Frost Art Museum starting April 18. It featured artwork from the graduating Bachelor of Fine Arts students. 

These talented artists are the pride of the FIU art community, and now they will embark on a journey where they will decorate the world with their beautiful creations. 

On April 18, The Beacon had the opportunity to gain a backstage pass to the entries that adorned the walls of the BFA Spring 2005 exhibition. This exhibition was far from conservative; the compelling art was edgy and powerful. 

When the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum opened its doors to the public, it deflowered its viewers of any false hope of the exhibit being less than perfect.

As one entered, Maria Blanco's photography was first to creep its way into the viewers eyes. Her bold view of woman hood was impressive. Her pictures consisted of a generally large woman wearing a girdle. 

"I have never known what it is like to be thin. Since the age of seven, I have been trapped in a fat body," said Blanco. 

Another impressive work was that of Jennifer Koivu. This oil-on canvas artist created self-portraits that did more than merely paint a picture - they showed her soul. "Within each portrait lays the struggle to find the truth of my own ego, to discover its meaning, thereby setting the viewer free to encounter their own," said Koivu. 

However, not all the works were meant to be so engaging and deep. Hugo Montoya took a lighter approach and proved it still makes great art. This photographer has an interesting and laid back view on art. 

"Life is full of sensational moments ... There is nothing deep about this work," said Montoya. "I'm not trying to change society."  

The reaction of the guests that strolled along the museum admiring the art was, for the most part, positive. 

"I truly feel that the art being shown here tonight is inspirational and shows great promise," commented sophomore Ximena Conesa.

Along with the good comments, however, also came the refutations. 

"This art is not bad, but I feel that with the talent these artists clearly possess, they could have done a better job," said freshman Rennie Roopchan. 

In the end, only time will tell whether or not this handful of newborn artists will reach the heights every artist wishes to achieve.

Subheadline: FIU's Installation Art finds a home in the design district
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When people think of modern art, they often envision paintings with colors chaotically splashed in every direction or abstract sculptures of monstrous proportions. But what comes to mind when the term "installation art" is mentioned?

Installation art was originally spawned from Western contemporary art in the 1960s. It incorporates media and objects in everyday life. In all, it's a conceptual experience of the environment.

This is exactly what happened as FIU's Installation Art class, lead by Associate Professor Tori Apad, had Miami's art scene buzzing with conversation over its exhibit at "Full Load," April 14.  The opening was held at The Loft Building located at 3627 N.E. 1st Ct., in the heart of the Design District.

Apad explained his role as art professor and what he hopes to accomplish with the exhibit. "I feel that it is important to break down the hierarchies of class rank and professor," said Apad.

The Installation Art class is a collaboration between FIU's art department and the Wolfsonian Museum of Miami Beach. It was created to enrich and inspire artistic minds. The class consists of Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) and Master's of Fine Arts (MFA) students.

For the first half of the semester, students tour the Wolfsonian's exhibits and library with various curators, learning about design, propaganda art and communication. The students get hands-on experience as they learn to design and build sets. 

The students then present proposals to Professor Apad and the museum staff. They spend the rest of the semester taking everything that they have learned, and labor late into the night creating a piece of modern art.

Upon entry to the museum, Jamie A. Segui's tagging entitled "Full Load" captured the heart of the exhibit. The pictures featured an apostle-like figure holding a gushing heart while looking up into the heavens. The florescent lighting overhead appeared almost heavenly, as it emphasized the paint's outlines. 

Natalia Zuluaga's "Tapestry of Sound" was easily seen hanging in Paul McCartney's recording studio. The piece boomed with sound as tapes from cassettes raced in criss-cross patterns, only to end up in a heap on the floor. Imagining Natalia spending long hours weaving the film onto the frame, is enough to drive one into sheer madness.  

Patty Suau explained the significance of her piece "Sound Bite." 

"A sound bite is a phrase that means a brief recording. It's abstract, but what is it really?" 

Elegant white cloths with various countries' names printed on them dripped down to a mechanical device that played brief speeches by different political figure heads. The interesting thing about the piece is that it was all in braille.

If the fact that Patty had to fabricate a machine to punch the braille wasn't impressive enough, when she replied, "It's supposed to represent communication via art. It all goes in different ways. It connects to everyone," that took the cake.

Viewers fell into another world upon entering Becky Flower's "Untitled." The room became a new atmosphere, illuminated at all varying heights. It was reminiscent of a hallway in "Labyrinth" or the "Dark Crystal" as viewers were transported into another world.  

Jamie A. Segui's second piece, "Leave a Message," fascinated viewers as they became fixed to a television screen showing a home film of people.  The video was backed by a soundtrack of obscure answering machine messages.

It took Santo-Martin Cordero 1,360 spoons to create a work of geometrical wonder. The spoons start off in a small circular pattern and then fan out into a monstrous size.  

"It's spoon feeding wisdom and knowledge with the reflection of light.  It's the miraculous and the mundane," Cordero explained as the reflection of the light, hypnotized eyes into the design.

It was nothing less than the fabulous life-styles of the rich and famous for the sensational  Jillian Paige. Her artwork was showcased through a visual store.

"Welcome to my store. I'm selling my hair and two of my souls," she exclaimed to 'customers.'

It's all in the family as Devorah Bowen's "Group Portrait" showed true comradery with collaboration from the class.  Each member placed several personal objects in a bottle which hung in limbo, encompassed by a wooden frame.

"I enjoyed the Installation Art class because it gave me a chance to create and get my work out to the community," said Vanessa .

Her piece, "Tobacco Origins Only" could easily be the best anti-smoking ad known to man. Envision a line of cigarette butts linked together and tagged to create a time-line of smoking hazards. The smell of the old tobacco alone will make anyone's stomach turn at the site of a cigarette.  Phillip Morris, Big Tobacco has got you now!

"I'm a mentor. I just set up an opportunity of these artists to learn and grow. It's like a petry dish - now grow," Professor Apad explained when talking about her class.

The Full Load exhibit features art of amazing feats.  As viewers sip on wine and conversate, they also learn at the same time.  They learn about various ways of communication, rather than just through the conventional methods. 

 As Professor Apad and her class explained through their exhibit, art is a bridge for people.  Artists have a responsibility to communicate with others. There fore, they must strive to make their messages clear enough for the masses to take in the information. In turn, audiences will experience new ways of conception that they never imagined possible.

The Full Load exhibit goes from Thursday, April 14 to 28.  The Loft Building hours are from 2p.m. to 6p.m.

The show will continue Saturday, April 23 from 7p.m. to 10p.m. as Professor Jacek Kolasinski curates a collection of student- made films and shorts.

&nbsp;
I am extremely disappointed with the article in the April 18th Beacon titled "Boozin' - A guide to turning 21." This article was not a guide, it was not informative, and it was most definitely what is wrong with young adults today. I myself am 21 years old so this isn't coming from someone who is out of the loop. I feel that the school newspaper shouldn't be encouraging people to go ahead and get drunk, vomit all over your room, and then "discourage your dog from lapping up bong water" the following day. Whether this article was intended as an actual guide or this was just a sarcastic column meant to be taken lightly-- I couldn't tell. There is no humor in encouraging young adults to go out and get plastered because, hey...that's the ONLY way to have a great birthday. Getting drunk is NOT the only thing we can do to have fun; I hope in the future Alicia Bustamante can write another guide of fun things to do that doesn't involve kegs and bottles of Grey Goose.

Headline: Softball swept in four games by Ragin' Cajuns
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers came into the weekend as winners of eight consecutive games, but No. 14 Louisiana-Lafayette was too much for the FIU team to handle.

Despite contesting ULL to two one-run ball games, FIU failed to score a run in three of the four games played.

The Ragin' Cajuns completed their first ever regular season road sweep of the Golden Panthers, as they improved to 32-7 overall and remain undefeated in the Sun Belt Conference with an 8-0 record.

"We had two, one-run games where we hit well and pitched well," said coach Kim Gwydir. "I felt we could have won either of those games."

The Golden Panthers dropped to 26-20 for the season and 4-4 in conference play. 

The Golden Panthers will play their final home games of the season, a four game Sun Belt series, against Western Kentucky. 

The doubleheaders will begin at 1 p.m. on April 23 and April 24.

April 16, ULL 1 FIU 0 

In a classic pitching match up between FIU's Amanda Nealer and ULL's Brooke Mitchell, which was the second longest game in the all time series between the two teams, the Ragin' Cajuns came out victorious with a 1-0 win.

Nealer had allowed  no hits through the first five and two-third innings, until the top of the sixth, when ULL's Lacey Bertucci broke it up with a two-out single. 

Nealer went nine innings and gave up just one unearned run on three hits, as  her record fell to 14-10 on the season. 

"[Nealer] pitched well the first game of each day," Gwydir said. "We out-hit them [in this game], but they just came out on top."

Mitchell improved to 20-6 on the year with a complete-game shutout, striking out 10 Golden Panther batters and giving up six hits in the process.

The only run of the contest came when  ULL's Tiffany Hebert singled to shallow center in the ninth inning, scoring Joy Webre to record the win.

April 16, ULL 10 FIU 0 

While game one was among the closest contests in the all-time series, game two proved to be the biggest blowout as the Ragin' Cajuns defeated the Golden Panthers 10-0 in five innings.

This was the first of two mercy-rule games that FIU lost to ULL during the weekend.

Heather Bobbitt improved to 7-0 on the year, scattering three hits and one walk while striking out five for ULL. 

Tiffany Ore fell to 8-6 with the loss, gave up five runs (one unearned) on five hits and struck out five in four innings of work.

"Ore had injuries she sustained last weekend," Gwydir said. "We were decimated by injuries to out pitching staff."

The Ragin' Cajuns scoring began with a home run from Danyele Gomez, who finished the game with two hits, three runs scored and three RBIs. UL went up 2-0 after first and just continued to pile on the runs as the game wore on.

The scoring was then capped off with runs in the top of the fifth off of FIU's Nina Dyer.

April 17, ULL 2 FIU 1 

FIU got off to a better start on Sunday afternoon in the final two games of the series, but the Ragin' Cajuns eventually prevailed and locked up the series sweep.

Jennifer Powell blasted her third homerun of the season in the sixth and provided the Golden Panthers' lone run of the weekend.

Louisiana-Lafayette jumped out to a 2-0 lead and never looked back as FIU stranded five runners in scoring position and could not match ULL's offensive production.

Amanda Nealer pitched for the Golden Panthers, but after two perfect innings, she gave two runs on four hits to fall to 14-11 for the season.

Brooke Mitchell picked up the win, improving to 21-6 on the year, while giving up one run on two hits with 11 strikeouts and five walks.

April 17, ULL 9 FIU 0

In game two, for the second time in as many days, the Golden Panthers were shut out on a five-inning mercy-rule, 9-0.

Coming into the weekend the Ragin' Cajuns only had one mercy-rule victory in 23 contests against FIU.

Heather Bobbitt recorded the win for ULL and improved to 8-0. She gave up five hits in five scoreless innings. Tiffany Ore picked up the loss and fell to 8-7 for the season.

The Ragin' Cajuns opened the game with four runs in the first inning and later put the game out of FIU's reach when Codi Runyan hit a two-run homerun in the top of the fifth, scoring Tara Hamilton, who led off the inning with a walk.

Headline: Baseball on roll with sweep of NMSU
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Despite controversial moves by Head coach Danny Price within the pitching staff, the baseball team got a much needed boost of confidence with a sweep of conference opponent New Mexico State University, April 15-17 at University Park campus. 

FIU improves its record to 26-14 overall and 7-5 in Sun Belt Conference play, where it had performed mediocre prior to this series.

"The bullpen improved the most, and we made no [major] errors on defense," said Price. "Our pitchers attacked the strike zone all weekend and were helped out by the defense at times."

The Aggies entered the series leading the conference with a .346 batting average but were held to a total of only 18 hits and six runs. 

The Golden Panthers continue conference play at No. 13 Louisiana-Lafayette, April 22-24. 

FIU 5, NMSU 2

Price surprised many by moving 2003 All-Sun Belt closer Danny Hernandez (2-4) to the starting rotation, but the senior delivered as he earned the win in his first Division-I start and pitched seven innings of work, allowed only one run, four hits, walked six and struck out seven batters. "I was excited, you know, because I've always wanted my first Division-I start," said Hernandez. "The chance finally came and I felt like a little kid again."

Redshirt junior Bryan Pullin, junior Yahmed Yema and freshman James McOwen each had two hits to pace FIU's 10-hit attack.

FIU got on the board in the bottom of the third inning when two runs scored off Yema's 10th homerun of the season.

The very next inning, the Aggies scored a run by taking advantage of an FIU throwing error.

FIU replied with two more runs in the bottom of that inning off a two-run double by Pullin and breathed easy for the rest of the contest.

FIU 9, NMSU 1

Senior David Asher (7-0), the usual Friday night starter and staff ace, was moved down in the rotation for an extra day's rest. It was another move by Price that proved to work as the lefty pitched like his usual self. He went seven and two-third innings, allowed only one run, five hits, walked only two batters and struck out eight.

Yema led FIU offensively as he went 3-for-5 with a homerun, four RBI and two runs scored.

"Outstanding performances [by Asher and Yema]," Price said. "It's something I've come to expect from them." 

FIU's offensive outburst came right from the start. In the bottom of the first, Pullin singled to left field, and junior Michael Lopez reached on a hit-by-pitch. Yema then brought both of them, and himself, home with a three-run homerun, to take a 3-0 lead.

The Golden Panthers did not score again until they scored two more runs in the fifth inning, but the damage had already been done.

FIU added four more runs in the seventh. Junior Matt Rainey struck out one batter as he pitched a scoreless and hitless one and one-third inning.

FIU 4, NMSU 3

The Aggies entered the final game of the series not wanting to be swept, but they blew a late-inning lead to give FIU its first SBC sweep of the season.

Frank Gonzalez (5-0) earned the win as he pitched one inning of scoreless relief in the eighth. Rainey, who entered the series with a team-high 8.83 ERA, was another pawn in the pitching staff shifts, as he was controversially moved to closer. But the Texan came through in his first save opportunity, as he struck out two batters in one inning pitched, enroute to his first save as a Golden Panther.

"He has a good arm," Price said. "I think this new role helped him [and] gave him positive thinking."

Freshman second baseman Corey Lozano went 2-for-3 with the game-winning RBI. 

Junior Luis Rivera also had two hits as FIU had only seven hits of the game. 

The Golden Panther trailed 3-2 with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning. With runners at the corners, Coach Price rolled the dice and sent Yema to steal second. As he did so, Pullin scored from third on the throw and tied the game. 

Two batters later, Lozano hit a solid single to right field and Yema, the go-ahead run, came around to score. 

Freshman Elih Villanueva had his second straight solid start as he pitched seven innings, allowed three runs, six hits, walked two and struck out five batters.

Headline: Editor's three-year trek comes to an end, bids loyal staff goodbye
Author: Alejandra Diaz
&nbsp;
It's over! Yes, it is officially over. My college career has ended and most importantly so has my run as Editor in Chief of The Beacon for the past year. Honestly, I am not sure whether I am upset, depressed or elated that I will be graduating in a few short weeks. The Beacon has been good to me. I have learned, excelled and had the opportunity to serve the FIU community by providing students with an outlet to express themselves in writing. 

I just can't believe that for the past year, I ran a newspaper, for goodness sake. Few people can say that their sole responsibility was to manage a newspaper that was published twice a week. Now I know that you may think that I am crazy. How could taking on the stress of a twice-a-week publication schedule, with a rookie staff and close to no pay be rewarding? It wasn't rewarding - it was life altering.

Three years ago, I transferred to FIU, changed my major and decided that journalism was my calling. At the time I thought I was insane, but figured that I would never know unless I tried. So, I became a staff writer at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Three months later I was the BBC Editor and had the most stories ever printed on the front pages of The Beacon from BBC. At the time I thought I was hot stuff but not until a new Editor in Chief was hired, and I knew her job would eventually be mine. 

That's right. I'll admit it. I became a managing editor and knew from day one that if I spent one year as a glorified assistant, I could not only do her job but I could have a great time. And so it happened. On April 14, 2004, the media board interviewed me and elected me as the new Editor in Chief of The Beacon. What an honor, I thought, as I sat there and realized the huge responsibility I had just taken on. But like I have always told my staff - everything happens for a reason.

It's been a little over a year and here I am, at a crossroad in my life. Although I am overwhelmed with pride and happiness, deep down I have an overwhelming sadness that I have to leave The Beacon and a group of people that I have come to know as my family. 

When I first started as Editor in Chief, I had three staff members I rehired from the year before. Slowly but surely, we were able to bring in people from all over the place. We visited classes, put up flyers, called around, and eventually we grew to a staff of over 40. They were young and inexperienced, but they tried hard, worked hard and made my year as Editor in Chief one of the best that The Beacon has ever seen. 

I am proud of what I was able to contribute to The Beacon, but I could never have done it without the help and dedication of these young, humble journalists. They didn't know what they were in for when I hired them, but they were all there from day one, committed to one goal - to produce the best issue possible for you, our reader. 

My staff never quit or allowed each other to quit without a fight. They stuck together, learned together and kept each other out of trouble. I am proud of them and am glad that they let me lead them for the past year. They can no longer call themselves rookies, because they are the best trained staff in the business and I honor their courage for sticking with me. 

On April 12, The Beacon hired my successor, a young motivated, eager guy who started as a staff writer two years ago and has made a name for himself among the staff. Harry Coleman is the best person to take over my job and I say that without hesitation. He is trained, enthusiastic and fully prepared to carry The Beacon on his shoulders with the help of the staff, of course. My only hope for him and his staff is that they stay together, take care of each other and work to take The Beacon to even greater heights. I have no doubt they will make me proud.

So finally, in this, my final farewell, I want to credit them for my success, my triumphs but most importantly for always being there when the newspaper seemed too much for one person to bare. Without my staff I couldn't have improved readership, committed to one stable design, grown as a leader or made it through over 60 issues in the course of three semesters. So, thank you. 

Thank you to the section editors who made my day with in-depth stories and well-edited content and for sticking around until the late hours of the night. Thank you to the copy editors who edited for 14 hours straight even when their eyes were watering and their hands were red from all the ink. Thank you to the page designers who designed creative layouts and put together pages like it was nobody's business. 

Thank you to the photography staff for always keeping the work sharp and in tune with our goals for photography this year. Thank you to the graphics department for always keeping the graphics imaginative and thoughtful. Thank you to the advertising staff who keeps the money rolling in. Thank you to the office support staff and the director of student media for making The Beacon's success his mission. And, finally thank you to all the writers who made The Beacon possible. Without them, we are nothing.

Headline: Film sanitization deemed immoral
Author: Bill Ferguson / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Taylor Hackford's 2000 film "Proof of Life," starring Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe, told the story of an American oil executive who was kidnapped for ransom by insurgents in a fictional South American country.

Hackford says he went to great lengths to portray the kidnapping as realistically as possible - which surely meant as brutally and dramatically as possible in an R-rated work.

The scene was slightly edited for television and airline audiences, with the director's approval. But Hackford was not consulted when a private company "sanitized" the film by removing the entire kidnapping scene because of its violent content. And he was not pleased.

"This unauthorized version may lead viewers to believe Taylor Hackford directs movies that just don't make sense," he told Congress last year.

Anyone who creates anything put before the public can sympathize with Hackford's complaint. His testimony was related to a provision in the Family Movie Act, which would permit the sale of technology that narrowly edits movies for specific content and exempts such action from copyright laws. The bill is expected to pass Congress.

But this is bigger than one clause in a single act. It concerns two larger challenges.

The first is protecting intellectual and artistic property in a digital age. The second is the right of the community to protect children from the harmful effects of popular culture.

Right now, it looks as if Hackford and his fellow directors are losing this round. For good reason.

To some degree, Hollywood asked for the pickle it's in. The number of companies that rid films of sexual and violent content - by selling editing equipment and already-edited DVDs - is growing because the demand is growing. Many viewers, fed up with gratuitous sex, violence and profanity on screens small or wide, want entertainment that doesn't expose children to it.

"We're providing a service Hollywood doesn't provide," says Ray Lines, founder of a Utah-based company called CleanFlicks, which sanitizes movies for what it calls "family-friendly viewing."

Once Hollywood began marketing films directly to consumers, so that we can now own something that for decades we could only watch at a set time and place, it lost control over what happens to the product. Lines started his company after a neighbor asked him to edit a movie with his high-end editing software. If the movie was legally purchased, why not?

Well, there is this tricky issue of copyright law, guaranteed as far back as Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Artists, like teachers and plumbers and football players, should be paid for their work. The film-sanitizing companies say they do that, by purchasing the DVDs they go on to edit.

An artist also should be allowed to protect the integrity of his or her work, as a scientist is able to patent a discovery. "The notion that someone can change my work without my permission and then make a business out of it is morally wrong," says the TV and film director Marshall Herskovitz.

But if that business is providing a sought-after service - one that is, arguably, a social good - is that still morally wrong? Film sanitizing wasn't available decades ago because the technology wasn't available. It wasn't necessary because television and films more accurately reflected community standards and values than they do today.

Despite the solemn pleas from famous directors, it's hard to oppose giving parents the tools to exert some control in their own homes.

But there will be many sequels to this story. The challenge of ensuring artistic integrity in a digital age will only grow as the free market offers new ways to customize what we view, read and hear. Copyright protections have changed enormously since the introduction of the printing press to England in the late 15th century. They're about to change again.

Headline: Radio station to increase signal strength
Author: Giovani Benitez / In-Depth Editor
&nbsp;
After 12 years since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first granted WRGP, FIU's radio station, a spot on the radio dial, the station is about to experience a dramatic change.

In an unprecedented move last summer, the FCC granted WRGP access to a stronger signal in South Florida through three radio translators which will carry the signal from WRGP's Homestead tower to the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. 

"We have built an audience in the South Dade area, but by in large, FIU students don't even know this place exists, and now we finally have the opportunity to let people in on that," said Brennan Forsythe, WRGP's newly elected general manager.

Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, dean for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, is excited about what WRGP can do for FIU students and said these translators will be an asset to the university.

"These translators provide the opportunity for WRGP to expand its scope and become an important informational and educational resource for FIU students on both campuses," said Kopenhaver.

Student Media Director Robert Jaross said that the Student Government Association, under the administration of Clayton Solomon two years ago, said it would set money aside to install the new translators above both libraries.  However, later on, the station came across some obstacles in getting that money.  

It wasn't until last week that SGA was able to confirm that money would be set aside for the project. As of press time, Solomon was not available for comment. 

While the money and license are now available, the station will have to wait until construction of the antennas begins in order to start broadcasting on both campuses.

"We have to build towers on top [of]  the campuses to put the translators.  There is no time frame," Jaross said.

In the meantime, WRGP will continue to broadcast in the South Dade area and on the Internet through streaming audio.  

When the translators are in place, the station will continue to broadcast on 88.1 FM, but the signal will be stronger on 95.3 FM near the University Park campus.

Headline: SJMC professor resigns after 20 years
Author: David Smiley / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Kevin Hall, Editor in Residence of the School of Journalism and Mass Communications, sent an eight-page letter to Dr. Lillian Kopenhaver, dean of the SJMC,  March 10, explaining his decision to resign. 

Hall's resignation is effective at the end of the Spring semester.

In a 20-year tenure as faculty member, Hall helped create the Journalism Writing Program, beginning with a $600,000 grant from the Knight Foundation. 

 Hall composed the majority of the SJMC grammar exam, and is also the president of the company that is the provider for the exam, The Word Association, Inc.

Hall's notice of resignation came seven days after SJMC students received an e-mail, March 3 from Patricia B. Rose, associate dean for the SJMC, which explained that changes were being made in the school's writing program.  

The e-mail explained that, beginning with the Summer term, the grammar exam would no longer be used as a pre-requisite for any other course besides MMC 3104, Writing Strategies.  

Similarly detailed were the decisions to incorporate grammar and AP style into the classroom, and to have all exit tests conducted in the MMC 3104 class rather than a computer lab.

Rose's e-mail also noted that the current Word Association exam will be replaced by an exam modeled after the grammar test used by the University of North Carolina.

FIU was left to look for a new grammar exam when Hall notified  Kopenhaver on Dec. 20 that the Word Association website did not wish to renew it's contract with FIU.  The contract ends June 30.

Rose said Hall's decision to not renew the Word Association contract was a surprise to the SJMC.

"That came totally out of the blue to all of us," said Rose. "Following that I sat down with [Hall] and asked him, since he was forcing us to get another exam by terminating that contract, if he would provide us with the questions and allow us to use the test, and he flatly refused."

Hall's principal reason for declining to renew the contract is that he claims he was never informed of the proposed changes to the writing program until they were voted on via e-mail, Dec. 2.  

"The first time I ever saw the pull to make these changes [to the writing program] was when it arrived in my e-mail box with a call to vote on it," Hall said.    	   Hall declined to vote, saying further discussion was needed.

Charles Green, director for the International Media Center at FIU and faculty member since 1986, also said he never saw the proposed changes until the day of the vote.  Green said he was on development leave during the Fall semester, but that there were still opportunities for the university to inform him of the proposals.  

Green voted down the changes.  The other five members of the faculty who voted, Michael Sheerin, Burt Delgado, Mercedes Vigon, Teresa Ponte and Mario Diament, approved the changes.

The changes were originally presented during the first meeting of the Fall semester.  Green and Hall missed this meeting.  However, Alan Richards, interim chair for Journalism and Broadcasting, said the writing program changes were discussed with all members involved in the vote, whether through subsequent faculty meetings or individual discussions.

Hall and Green said the approved changes in the program will only serve to lower standards and that they had all been previously thought of and dismissed.

"[The SJMC] has been so far ahead of the curve we're almost before our time," Hall said. "Other universities are beginning to see, and they're starting to move in our direction while we're moving in reverse. It is absolutely certain that you cannot have a successful impact on students teaching language skills, if you separate grammar from everything else."

Hall said the lowering of pre-requisite scores will take away both the incentive for students to study and the incentive for professors to teach grammar.

Green, who has never taught the Writing Strategies course, but worked closely with the group who originally designed the writing program, agrees with Hall.

"I think the faculty will let it slide and not be teaching grammar in class.  Most of  [the faculty] aren't grammarians.  They aren't grammar teachers," he said.

Richards, who has taught the Writing Strategies course for eight years, served as Hall's assistant director for four years and also contributed to the Word Association grammar exam. Richards believes that the changes are promoting better standards.  The changes, attests Richards, will promote continuity in teaching grammar throughout the SJMC curriculum.

"I don't like the idea of using [the test] as an entrance pre-requisite without constantly teaching grammar," said Richards.  

During the Fall 2004 semester, Richards replaced Hall as the director for the Journalism Writing Project. Rose and Richards said they met with Hall during the Spring 2004 semester and discussed having Hall relinquish his position as director.  

Richards said this was suggested due to what could have been perceived as a conflict of interest between Hall's position as director of the Writing Project and president of The Word Association, Inc.

"[Hall] was wearing a lot of hats," Richards said. "If there was a problem with the program, as the provider he would have to notify the director, which was himself."

The Word Association website did experience many problems during the Fall 2004 semester.  Students experienced difficulty accessing the website, which offers tools, like quizzes and practice tests, to help prepare for the exam.  Some students had test reservations cancelled and others were unable to reserve tests at all.

According to Rose, a similar issue was raised during the same meeting as to how professors answered students' questions about where the $15 test entrance fee was going.

"One [faculty member] did say a question was raised in class as to where the money for the test went, and that the answer was obviously to support the test and the programming," Rose said.

 Hall said that when the faculty was asked by students where the $15 test fee was going they answered: "I just don't know."

"The students were getting the idea that I alone was imposing this grammar test on them, and in order to collect the money from them to make myself rich," said Hall. "I can't tell you how much that hurt.  I have never made a penny.  In fact, every single month, for years, I have contributed my own money to keep that system going for FIU students."

Hall also stated that students received notice of the changes in March because he had been complaining of the wrongness of lowering standards and setting a future date without notifying students.

Rose has a different account of this.  She said that after changes are approved by SJMC faculty they must go through the Faculty Senate, which takes time.  Rose also said that students could not be notified until the SJMC had solidified all the changes, including which test it would use in the future.

"The announcement had absolutely nothing to do with Kevin Hall," Rose said.  "It made absolutely no sense to go out to students and say we're going to make changes, but we don't know what they're going to be." 

Hall would not elaborate on any other reasons for his resignation, but said about the changes in the Writing Program, "Certainly this is a part of [my resignation], but by no means the whole reason."

Hall said the Word Association website will most likely cease to function, as the company only served as a provider for FIU.  Hall said he never had the money to make the program flexible enough to accommodate other schools.

Dean Kopenhaver did not comment on Hall's resignation.

Headline: Student database idea stirs privacy concerns
Author: David Goldstein / Knight Ridder News Service
&nbsp;
Say you've just enrolled in college. Would you want your name and Social Security number put into a national student database in Washington?

You wouldn't have a choice under a scenario envisioned by the Department of Education, which is considering a plan to maintain files on virtually every college and university student in the country: 15 million students from 6,000 schools.

Federal education officials and supporters in the higher education community contend that the system would improve the tracking of graduation rates and help measure quality.

But other college and university leaders warn that it would raise the shadow of Big Brother at a time when many Americans are nervous about their privacy. There's also growing concern about identity theft.

Marie Zeglen, senior vice provost for planning and institutional effectiveness at Florida International University, described the proposal as ``a genuine desire to track students and understand how they obtain their college education. It might help them to design better financial aid programs.''

But Zeglen, like others, worry about unintended consequences.

''I have my concerns with all the identity theft and all that is happening today,'' she said.

Privacy issues are the first thing that come to mind for the typical person on the street, said Mary Sapp, assistant vice president for planning and institutional research at the University of Miami.

'"Those movies about the future, where Big Brother is watching everything you do, well, you worry about that sort of thing,'' Sapp said.

Supporters say the idea is neither new nor newly threatening: Thirty-nine states already require public colleges and universities to supply students' personal data.

In an interview last week, a top federal education official said that in response to worries over privacy, the department was exploring alternatives to using Social Security numbers. Grover Whitehurst, the director of the Education Department's Institute of Education Sciences, said officials had been discussing giving students individual bar codes instead.

''That would be a record that cannot be easily attached to other personally identifiable information,'' he said. ``We've just thrown it out in the last week ... to see if it would satisfy some of the concerns, which are legitimate.''

The idea for a national student database, first discussed last fall, grew out of the same push for more accountability in education that spawned the No Child Left Behind Act. That law has altered priorities and goals at the elementary and, to a degree, at the secondary school level.

Database backers in government and higher education say the ability to track students throughout their academic careers is being hamstrung.

Students are more mobile now. They transfer from school to school more often and drop out more frequently, sometimes returning years later to resume their studies. Each time they do, they're listed as new students, making graduation rates less reliable.

As outlined in an Education Department feasibility study, a database that used names and Social Security numbers would cover everyone, federal-aid recipients or not. Neither students nor schools could say no.

The study says security safeguards would prevent improper access to the database, noting that information compiled at the department's National Center for Education Statistics has never been ``wrongfully disclosed.''

Still, there might be loopholes.

''Under the Patriot Act, the attorney general and the Department of Justice could conceivably obtain access ... to fight terrorism,'' the study said.

From New England to the West Coast, college newspapers have editorialized against the plan.

''Students are definitely aware of the government's involvement in personal lives that has become more and more apparent since 9-11,'' said Jasmine Harris, the legislative director of the U.S. Student Association, which represents more than 1 million college students.

Whitehurst said building the database would cost the federal government $10 million to $12 million. Costs to schools would vary.

If the idea proceeds, he said, the Education Department hopes that Congress would include it in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which expires this year. A pilot program involving 1,500 schools could begin next year.
