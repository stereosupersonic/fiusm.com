Headline: Christian concert promotes spirituality
Author: Sue Arrowsmith/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Less than two weeks after the controversial film, "The Passion of The Christ" stirred an awakening throughout our nation. The Awakening came to University Park March 4. 

The first ever Christian concert at FIU, which was sponsored by The Navigators at FIU, an international, interdenominational organization, sought to bring awareness to students about the on-campus organization and help them grow spiritually. The event was co-sponsored by The Peacemakers from Trinity Church and dozens of donations from outside campus resources. The entire event was free to all FIU students, including the hot dogs, chips, and sodas. 

"We didn't want the students to pay for anything," said Vidal Olivas, leading representative for The Navigators. 

Double Syx, Leah Rouse, and The Awakening Band were the featured live entertainment. Rouse was a finalist on the popular television program "American Idol," Double Syx is a Christian rapper from Texas, and the band is from Pennsylvania. They came to FIU for what they believe is an important cause. 

"It's all about making God real to people," said Awakening band member Nick Hodges, who helped put the concert together. He's also part of the FIU College Campus Ministry and will begin teaching a non-credit Bible Studies class, free of charge, this month in the Graham Center.     

  Tables were set up around the Panther Hall pool area with flyers and clipboards from both participating organizations for those interested in attending meetings and Bible studies. Peacemakers passed around contact cards to keep students updated about upcoming events as students passed by on bicycles and rollerblades enjoying the breezy night.

Olivas was introduced to The Navigators when he was a student in his native Costa Rica. He joined fellow Navigators here and began working with the club at FIU, which is now two years old. 

The club meets on campus  regularly to develop a deeper understanding in the Gospel, but they also offer one-on-one support and counseling. It's their sense of unity and friendship that is, perhaps, the most positive aspect The Navigators share and that's what sets them apart. 

 Eddy Herrera, Navigator student president at FIU, explained how members also get together on campus to play sports or just hang out.    

Though the club is fairly new at FIU, the movement began about 70 years ago. The founding navigator was Dawson Trotman, a Navy man of California. While the world was at war in the 1940s, the U.S. government was suspicious of any groups who did not formally identify themselves. 

For that reason and because the initial members were all in the Navy, they called themselves The Navigators. But the name also has a deeper symbolism. 

It was founded on a pay-it-forward belief that Christianity should not be limited to worship at a church or temple, but instead should be based on living by the principles expressed in the Bible and passing on that knowledge to benefit others. 

In fact, Vidal points out, their main purpose is to reach non-religious people. As students made their way across campus they stopped to look. Initially they were drawn in by the music, then the free food sign, but most who got closer stayed to share the experience. They swayed to the music or clapped. Despite the students' participation, they were a little hesitant when it came down to signing up. 

FIU alumni Horby Lopez, a music major who took a brief break from rollerblading to eat a hot dog, said though he respects other peoples beliefs, he is not in favor of joining a group. 

Still, students each walked away from the concert with something different, as diverse as their reasons for being there. 

"It's a good way to relax and get away from the stress of school. FIU should do this more often," Lopez said. When asked why she was there, Marjani Christian, an early childhood education major, said, "I am here because I am a Christian and want to support their efforts." Yet, she also expressed her concerns about the overwhelming stress of college life and how committing to another club would just be too much right now. 

She's not alone. Most FIU students work and have multiple responsibilities that take up most of their free time.  

 Crystal Ortiz agreed that it's tough, but said it can be done. 

She's a management information systems student, an FIU employee, and part of The Navigators. "I go to one-on-one sessions or I'll only go if we're meeting at someone's house outside of school." 

Ironically, the same excessive pressure that keeps students from joining The Navigators is the very reason Olivas and others feel it's necessary to bring spirituality to FIU. They consider this particularly important for young people, especially college students who are sometimes away from their families and feel very alone. 

After listening to students' concerns, Olivas and Herrera considered working together on a more flexible schedule. 

Navigators are not easily discouraged, though. They know committing is not an easy thing to do and hope events like The Awakening will encourage students to at least stop by. Together with fellow sponsors, they are talking about another Awakening. "Hopefully," said Rachel Sturgeon of the Peacemakers, "we'll be able to do this for the students every semester."

Headline: Marsh isn't only one to blame for poor basketball program
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Donnie Marsh failed FIU.

In four years, the men's basketball coach failed to produce a winning season for the university. That's four years in which the Golden Panthers recorded at least 20 losses a year. That's why he was fired.

But FIU also failed Donnie Marsh.

For years, FIU has placed academics on such a high pedestal that skilled players have sat on the bench, filling precious scholarship slots while doing nothing. For years, FIU has been unable to attract top-quality players. For years, FIU has neglected its facilities. That's why FIU lost so many prospects and so many games.

Unlike many universities, FIU places an unusual amount of focus on a player's grades, sacrificing what could be a game-winning powerhouse, namely Taurence Johnson, for the possibility of transforming that person into a decent student.

Realistically, players of at least Johnson's caliber play collegiate basketball because they think it will lead to an NBA career. Graduating with a bachelor's degree is a mere afterthought. And while it's admirable for the university to want to give its student athletes something to fall back on, not every sinner can be a saint and not every student turns out to be a graduate.

If the university wants to see more games in the win column, then it should stop suspending players selectively. Wins draw bigger crowds and bigger crowds help recruit new players. Who's going to want to play before a tiny crowd against unranked opponents anyway?

FIU should also invest in its basketball facilities. Instead of using collapsible bleachers most people see only in high school gymnasiums, the university should upgrade the Golden Panther Arena and make it a more viable recruiting tool. 

Upholding academic standards at a university is not generally a bad thing, but when the students in question are athletes, some sacrifices may have to be made if the school wants a winning record. Otherwise, the university must face the facts and accept its losses. 

Administrators must realize that firing Marsh, and using him as a scapegoat will accomplish nothing. If Athletic Director Rick Mello and his staff are serious about the basketball program's level of competitiveness, several issues must first be addressed before the university hires a new coach. Otherwise, that person will be doomed to follow in Marsh's footsteps.

Headline: Ashcroft, Patriot Act quash civil liberties
Author: Ted  Randall/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
"Dissent is the highest form of patriotism."		- Thomas Jefferson

I was born in 1962. My parents were civil rights and anti-Vietnam War activists, hippies.  

At the age of eight or nine, I was listening to Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. When I was 10, I went with my mother to Washington, D.C. to march in an anti-war protest. I had long hair and wore bell-bottoms and a peace sign. 

My house was full of organizers.  My mom played a major role in the civil rights movement as a state organizer. I remember one eerie evening when two men in suits came to our house.  My mother stood in the doorway barring their entrance. They asked questions and then silently slipped away. My mother was very upset. Years later I was told that they were government agents - suits, the FBI. It seems that my mother's organizing activities had put her on a black list.  

My mother is still an activist and I worry about her as she speaks out for the causes she believes in under Attorney General John Ashcroft and the Patriot Act. 

During the 1950s through the '70s, the FBI conducted a massive domestic counterintelligence program coined Cointelpro. Designed to monitor communist activities and bolster intelligence gathering during the Cold War, Cointelpro turned to spying on domestic political dissidents.  FBI intelligence gathering activities covered a broad spectrum from the Women's Liberation Movement, to the John Birch Society, to the NAACP. The FBI spied on Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, the American Indian Movement, and organizers and activists.  Average American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights were investigated as criminals. FBI activities ranged from infiltrators, sabotage, to leaking disinformation about organizations and individuals. According to the ACLU website, Cointelpro: "Anonymously attacked the political beliefs of targets to try and have their employers fire them;

"Anonymously mailed letters to the spouses of targets to try and destroy their marriages;

"Falsely and anonymously labeled as Government informants members of groups known to be violent, thereby exposing the falsely labeled members to expulsion or physical attack."

There were such widespread constitutional violations by the FBI during Cointelpro that the government had to intervene. An investigation ensued, chaired by Senator Frank Church. 

The investigation reported that the FBI had created more than 500,000 domestic intelligence files on Americans and domestic groups. I guess there is one with my mother's name on it. The report determined that the FBI and CIA had conducted hundreds of break-ins where they planted illegal wiretaps and stole membership lists. Many of these activities resulted in the unjust arrest and conviction of thousands of Americans.

As result of the Church Committee findings, Attorney General Edward Levi implemented existing guidelines on general crimes, racketeering and terrorism enterprise investigations. This was done to create some form of First Amendment protection for Americans and to ensure that the FBI and CIA conducted domestic investigations only where criminal activity was suspected, not political activity.

Since 9-11, Attorney General John Ashcroft has modified these guidelines, granting the FBI and CIA the Cointelpro-like freedoms they enjoyed decades ago.  

Ashcroft has eliminated the criminal predicate from the domestic guidelines, therefore, allowing intelligence gathering agencies to freely investigate protected political and religious activities. 

Basically, the law can enter your church, show up at your door; attend a political convention or demonstration without any probable cause or judicial control. They can openly question you, take note of who is with you, and what is said and done. The FBI can infiltrate your e-mail, hack into your PC to collect which Web sites you have visited and even collect a list of the books you have read from the public library.

If you ask me, this is down right scary.  All they have to do is mistakenly connect the dots (or want to make you disappear) and under the Patriot Act, you are gone. No lawyer, no due process. Ashcroft may even be able to strip you of your U.S. citizenship.

This is designed to have a chilling affect on our First Amendment rights and our desire to dissent as much as it is to counter-terrorism. 

I get a little nervous even writing about this topic. 

The FBI has already been to the doors of thousands of citizens including a peace activist in California, an art gallery opening an exhibit entitled "Secret Wars," and a community college student for having an anti-Bush poster on the wall of her dorm. 

Ashcroft has the freedom to designate whomever and whatever as a domestic terrorist group or threat - Greenpeace, NOW, PETA, your fraternity or sorority.

This administration has used 9-11 and the fear associated with terrorism to attack our civil liberties. Under the Patriot Act - talk about a misnomer - more than 762 immigrants, mostly Arab and Muslim, have been incarcerated and deported. They were held in detention without bail, a lawyer, their families not told where they were, and they were not even charged with a crime. 

Let's see, that violates the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments.

We are living in a state of fear in which challenging or questioning our government is frightening.  We are being hemmed in by state control. 

Soon we will be goose stepping, waiving the flag blindly without question. Next time you hear a knock on the door it may not be a friend.

Headline: What's so funny about peace, love, understanding?
Author: Alexander Blanco/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
What's so funny about "peace," "love" and "understanding?" Lots.

Let me say here as a caveat that this lil' piece 'o mine is no more than a critique of a popular refrain issued from a pop singer and nothing more. In this minor missive for the masses, I will try to hold up a broken looking-glass to these times and interpret, however myopically, the abstract reflection I see.

In my two decades plus roaming the byways of this planet, I've never known a time when "peace" was not a relative term. "Peace," as it was taught to me by my second grade elementary school teacher, is the blanket definition for a time when our military is not in direct hostile conflict with another military. I took this to mean that when there are no bombs a-dropping, then everything was a-OK. 

But lately I have come upon a quote by George Bernard Shaw that has me doubting my everything. It goes, "I felt I have had to interrupt my education to go to school." Well, it comes to pass that I feel that way, too, as countless of others do, and have had to reevaluate most of the clunky bric-a-brac strewn in the four corners of my cranium.

First off is a reconsideration of what "peace" is. If "peace" = "not war," then it is fitting to define what war is and move on from there. According to Herman Hesse, war is "childishness on a gigantic scale." My after hours studies agree, and I opine that Hesse has had the last say on war, in fact - subsequently, all of Hitchens & Co. is post-script, nit-picking, filling in the details in the global coloring book, et cetera. 

So what is "not war?" A place in time when conflict ceases to interest? No, conflict is the only interest, some say, and without it, we wouldn't evolve. It must then be a state, condition, atmosphere in which the consequence of twin straying ideologies of governing powers, and the way they are put to practice are congruent if not parallel in the sense, that there is no point where the two (or three, or four?) destructively intersect. This also means that the two are mutually exclusive in mutual agreement to be so and that synergy is a concept better left stillborn than caesarian-sectioned.  

"Not war," therefore, is not so much "peace" in the common sense, but an hyphenate halcyon symbiosis truer to Huxley's brave new vision than George Orwell's belligerent endgame. Where Huxley's fiction demonstrated the neutralizing effects of a genetically engineered society through symbiotic synergy, Orwell extended the nightmare of a totalitarian regime to near 100 percent dominance of the individual via fear and mis-information (in a splendid, if a mite stagnant, prose). One society, Huxley's, lived in a numbed state, but was very "peace"ful. The other society had never-ending wars with other continents and lived in a kingdom of fear. 

I am still at odds where we have fallen, if indeed either fits our fate in our collective human drama.

"Peace," I now believe, is a stalemate cease-fire between its twin seekers, visionaries and philosophical Luddites lackadaisically navel-gazing to pass their time. There is nothing more elitist than "peace." Either you are for it or against it, right? You either march and disturb the, um, quiet on Pennsylvania Ave, or rage pro invasions on, um, Pennsylvania Ave. Either way, march on!

What is so funny about "peace?"  The fact that there is a belief that it's an attainable concept. This is not to say that it shouldn't be striven for. 

Like all fallacious beliefs, it harms no one to kneel and pray, as long as that is as far as it goes. Isn't it odd that the most religious of folks have a queer penchant for throwing stones? 

Now as for "love" and "understanding," I have never understood "love." To take from Leonard Cohen, "Maybe there is a God above, but all I ever seem to learn from "love" is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you." 

So, every time I hear Elvis Costello sing, or have a midnight screening of "Lost in Translation," I give a little chuckle and pretend the world isn't as wicked as some may say.  It's just that I have a little trouble "understanding" it.

Subheadline: Gay marriage an oxymoron
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the Editor:

Today's biggest oxymoron: "Gay" marriage - and the largest attack on morality and most notable attack on the Constitution to date. 

Marriage is a clearly defined institution and legal status that has been around since before the founding of this nation. 

Whether or not you agree with homosexuality, there can be no mistake that this is an attack on the already vulnerable and weakened institution known for thousands of years as "marriage."

First of all, calling it "gay" marriage is an automatic acknowledgement that marriage itself is defined as between a man and a woman. Otherwise it would be called "heterosexual" or "normal" marriage. This gives a small minority of people the power to subvert the will of the people.

The majority of Americans recognize marriage for what it is and for its true purpose: to raise a family. 

Most Americans disagree with homosexuality but have no problem with its existence. 

Allowing gay marriage is forcing the majority to accept something they do not agree with. It is equivalent to a group of atheists forcing the word "G-d" out of public institutions because they are offended by that word.

And, let's face it, gay marriage is not a civil rights issue. A small minority of people want to make it a civil rights issue - but it is not. 

It is changing the definition of a word for a small number of people who cannot accept their own limitations. Marriage is between a man and a woman - and that is the way it is.

Headline: Men's basketball ends season on sour note
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Feb. 28 - FIU 43, WKU 74

The Golden Panthers, still looking for their first road victory of the season, failed again, falling 74-43 to Western Kentucky in Bowling Green on Feb. 28.

Both teams battled from the beginning, exchanging numerous leads, but the Hilltoppers went on a 15-3 run midway through the first half and never looked back. At the break, WKU led FIU 29-18 and led by as many as 34 points with 1:06 to play in the second half.

Raphael daSilva and Carlos Morban led FIU with 13 and 12 points, respectively. FIU struggled offensively, shooting 35.6 percent for the game, including a first half where the team hit just 6-of-21 shots. The team also committed 23 turnovers.

And once again, the Golden Panthers could not keep the game close in the second half, something head coach Donnie Marsh pointed out.

"We played with a lot of energy at the start of the game, which kept us connected in the game. About halfway through the half we took a couple of quick shots and when they came down with the rebound. We didn't have real good defensive balance so they were able to [create] transition on us," said Marsh.

FIU played just eight players. Byron Burnett had three blocks, which give him a total of 34 blocks on the season, the most for a Golden Panther since the 1990-91 season.

March 1 - FIU 42, Middle Tennessee 60

The final game of the season for Donnie Marsh's team ended the same way almost all the others did - with a loss, falling 60-42 to the Blue Raiders on March 1.

FIU was held scoreless for nearly 10 minutes during the first half and entered halftime trailing 35-17.

"I thought it was a case of them playing harder on the offensive end than we did on defense during that stretch," said a helpless and disappointed Marsh after the game.

Carlos Morban led FIU with 10 points and was the only Golden Panther in double figures. Only four points were contributed off the bench.

Michael Cuffee led the Blue Raiders with 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting. Middle Tennessee, which hit nine three pointers in the game, advanced to the Sun Belt Conference tournament where they will face Western Kentucky.

FIU hit 10-of-12 free throws in the second half after shooting none in the first half. 

The loss ended a miserable season for FIU (5-22) and marked the fourth straight season of 20 or more losses. FIU's five wins were the lowest season total in school history.

Headline: Johnson's struggles ultimately cost Marsh his job
Subheadline: Commentary
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When trying to pinpoint the inaccuracies of basketball programs all over the country, there are some infamous words grouped together that make up one of the most memorable press conference rants of all time.

"Practice?! Practice?! Man, we talkin' 'bout practice. Practice, man.

"We aint even talkin' 'bout the game; we talkin' 'bout practice, man. How am I gonna make my teammates better by practicing?"

Ah, the words of the great Allen Iverson after losing a first-round playoff series in 2001-02. The same Iverson who carried his team to the NBA Finals the previous season after a year-long rift with head coach Larry Brown and admitting his absence from mandatory weight training sessions.

What conclusion can we draw from this? That in basketball, unlike any other sport, you can, firstly, win with jerks on your team. And secondly, one player - which must be recruited in college hoops - can carry your team.

FIU has had its share of problems within the men's basketball program this reason. In order to win, especially in basketball, you need that rough-around-the-edges guy. The one that is mentally and physically tough. And on top of toughness, you need someone with basketball talent. But sometimes there are character flaws that come as part of the package.

Had former FIU head coach Donnie Marsh not recruited the oft-problematic Taurence Johnson, who usually plays well when he's not suspended, he might have won fewer games than he already has.

Think for a second what would happen should FIU recruit a bunch of model citizens that struggled, in the basketball department. Nothing positive comes to mind, huh?

For starters, even more losses and fewer people in the stands.

One player can dominate a game in this sport unlike any other. Look, the New York Yankees just traded for arguably the best player in baseball, Alex Rodriguez, and have bolstered their roster in an unprecedented way. But that guarantees little beyond the fact they'll play 162 games this year like everyone else.

In basketball, it's different. All you need is that one player who can carry the load on his shoulders. And sometimes, to get that player, you have to take risks on someone who isn't exactly as nice a guy as Tim Duncan.

Look around America. Everyone this side of Duke has problematic players in their program because all those coaches think they are the one that will turn that kid's life around and in return, that player will guarantee cutting down the nets. 

Look at Carmelo Anthony at Syracuse. His NBA team, the Denver Nuggets are suddenly in playoff contention for the first time since 1778. Why? Because one man can have that kind of impact in basketball, unlike any other sport.

So when Marsh went out and brought in Johnson, he was doing what he had to do to try and win. Can't blame the guy. Just so happened that Johnson, who Marsh had hoped would be the team's franchise player, turned out to be a bad investment whose failure played a part in costing Marsh his job. 

But what if Johnson became the player Marsh believed he could be? Would Marsh still be coaching FIU? Probably.

Just so happened Marsh was unable to find that one player that could have saved his job.

He says he has a Phd but doest even have a BA at any accredited school.  see link  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/paluxy/degrees.html  I will be passing out copies of this today outside the lecture and asking people what they think about SGA promoting something so fraudulent. I have no problem with what he is lecturing about but I do have a problem with my SGA passing a fraud off to college students as real.

Headline: Gay Marriage article clarifications
Subheadline:  
Author: ccasuals95@bellsouth.net
&nbsp;
Dear Editor,

I feel that I MUST comment on some of the misleading and/or incorrect statements and arguements in this article.

1) "Growing up, Judeo-Christian values taught me that homosexuality is a sin, but it's just another form of hatred. I'm not gay, but what if I was? I wouldn't want someone hating me," Israel said.

Homosexuality is sin and I don't know where Israel grew up or where he was taught but Judeo-Christian teaching is to LOVE the sinner but NOT the sin. This is NOT hatred and this needs to be clarified, anyone who hates the gay person is also a sinner.

2)"it's kind of ridiculous that in 2004, gay people can't get tax and insurance benefits that straight married couples do." 

This quote also needs correction as the vast majority of insurance policies now include the option for "domestic partners" to be added in some terminlogy or another.  Regarding tax breaks, it is the married couples that pay higher tax rates almost in every situation and that needs to be corrected in the system if the family unit is to be held together.

3)Boehme claimed that until you have friends who are gay, you really don't understand the gay person's perspective.

This may be true but their perspective doesn't make it any more right than the perspective of the serial killer who sees no wrong in what he is doing.

4)Casas said, "Denying this basic freedom to 10 percent of the population takes away a basic American principle and that is the pursuit of happiness."

"Persuit of one's happiness" cannot take precedence over the basic issues of what is morally correct as dictated by scripture and ALL major faiths for thousands of years. After all, if it made me happy to go into your handbag and take what I want that does not make it right.  If if makes me happy to have sex with a ten year old(or three at the same time) that does not make it right. This society has been redirecting it's thoughts to "whatever makes me happy is okay" and that needs to stop before it's too late. 
This country was built on religious freedom but sadly some people are using freedom as an excuse to do whatever they want and in the end I predict that this ABUSE OF FREEDOM WILL DESTROY THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
It's time to put a stop to this "free do do whatever I want attitude".

Sincerely,
Andrew Cawley

Headline: Marsh fired after losing season
Author: Harry Coleman/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After four straight losing seasons, athletic director Rick Mello dismissed head basketball coach Donnie Marsh on March 4.

Mello said, a search will begin to find a replacement, but his efforts will be kept private. There is no preference for an experienced coach or one with South Florida ties. 

Mello would also like to wait for postseason play to be over in order to find candidates there.

"There is no kind of profile. Miami is a unique place and I just want to get someone who can fit our profile and do a good job at FIU, but you always try to get someone with as much experience as possible," Mello said.

FIU just ended its worst season in 18 years with a miserable 5-22 record failing to make the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. In Marsh's previous three seasons at FIU, his teams posted records of 8-21, 10-20 and 8-21.

Mello rated competitiveness as the final factor in the decision to relieve Marsh from his coaching duties.

"Wisdom, effort, integrity and doing the right things, you can ask no more than that from Donnie, but the main reason we made a change is that we weren't getting the results we wanted to," Mello said.

"The university is very appreciative of coach Marsh for the manner in which he led our basketball program," added Mello. "Donnie has always given 100 percent with the highest degree of class and dignity one could ask. We just feel from a competitive standpoint, that it is time to seek a new direction."

It was a year of injuries and suspensions that hurt Marsh's team and caused the coach to play players that weren't ready to play the long minutes they were being asked to. 

"There's no question we would have been better. The lineup I envisioned at the start of the season consisted of Junior Matias, Carlos Morban, Taurence Johnson and Eulis Baez. Because of different situations, this did not happen and the Marcus Robinsons and Byron Burnetts had to play more minutes than we would have liked," Marsh said.

As a result, Marsh's team averaged just 56.1 points per game, ranking at the bottom of the conference.

It's a challenge in a difficult league, but we did a good job of competing by how well we defended. But it comes down to scoring points and we didn't do that," Marsh said.

Marsh still had 20 months left on his contract. Due to a clause on the contract, the university can assign him to another position. Marsh has not made a decision yet on accepting another position.

"I don't know. At this point we have yet to discuss anything," Marsh said. "They [FIU] have the right to reassign me in my contract. We will talk again after I clear my head sometime next week."

Especially with the possible return of players like Robinson, Matias and Raphael daSilva, who have a year of experience. Marsh would have liked to have another season to provide results. "I would have liked to have another year and I am disappointed we didn't show more progress. 

"This year again we got hit by injuries and other situations, but in this league with four straight 20-loss seasons, losing the job is a possibility and that's what happened," Marsh said.

Headline: Is gay marriage OK?
Subheadline: FIU students, faculty disagree on proposal to ban gay marriage
Author: Indra Bosko/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
President Bush's Feb. 24 speech asking Congress to support his proposal to enact an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage has triggered mixed reactions among the FIU community.  

Views are spread across the spectrum. 

Some students and faculty are still trying to define what same-sex marriage is. 

Others, for religious reasons, are opposed to gay marriage. And a number of students express support for gay marriage.

The president's decision came after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's recent decision granting marriage rights to same-sex couples and Mayor Gavin Newsom's more than two-week-old decision to issue 
marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.

Bush's proposal comes eight years after Congress passed the Defense Marriage Act. The Act defines the word 'marriage' as the legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.

"The union of a man and a woman is the most enduring human institution honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith," Bush said. 

The president of the Impact Movement, a branch of the Campus Crusade for Christ, agrees with President Bush and believes that same-sex marriage is a sin. 

The FIU student explained that  "from the beginning of time. [the Bible] doesn't say that marriage should be with a man and a man, it says marriage should be with a man and a woman. I find [Bush] to be very brave to step up and ban it. He is putting his words into actions."  
Martina M., a sophomore majoring in education, and a Jehovah's Witness, said, "the Bible tells us that we know that God disapproves of homosexuality. That's why he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah," she said.

Sociology professor Ronald Stubbs explained that some people and the Bush administration are opposed to gay marriages"because many people, especially those who are socially conservative, see same-sex marriage as a fundamental challenge to traditional notions of the institutions of the family, and maybe as a legitimization of what they see as being a 'deviant' lifestyle." 
 
He also added that the current administration happens to comprise some of the most extreme conservatives and questions who has the power to apply labels and enforce the meaning of marriage. 

"The country might be going to 'hell in a basket' in terms of socioeconomic factors, but they want to talk about who is allowed to get married. It's really very pathetic," Stubbs said.

Even though some people grew up with conservative or religious values, some students, such as senior Admatha Israel, a psychology and political science major, believes that gay people should do whatever they want to do. 

"Growing up, Judeo-Christian values taught me that homosexuality is a sin, but it's just another form of hatred. I'm not gay, but what if I was? I wouldn't want someone hating me," Israel said.

Martina also noted that much of what we deemed unacceptable 20 years ago is prevalent today.

Almost 300 years ago, African-Americans were not allowed to marry until after the Civil War. 

According to sources, it was only 35 years ago that interracial couples were allowed to get married. Thirty-five years later, same-sex couples are fighting for the same rights. 

President Bush said, "unless action is taken, we can expect more arbitrary court decisions, more litigation, more defiance of the law by local officials, all of which adds up to uncertainty."

Bush added that the Defense of Marriage Act will be struck down by activist federal courts. In that event, every state would be forced to recognize any relationship that judges in Boston and San Francisco choose to call a marriage.

However, Bush's views may or may not reflect the opinions held by FIU faculty and students.

One FIU history professor believes that these rights should be granted. "If activists push for rights, there will be a backlash, but ultimately they will triumph."
 
What is known is that gay and lesbian couples from more than 20 states have lined up outside their city halls in a public challenge to President's Bush's comments against gay marriage. 

According to the Associated Press, at least 38 states and the federal government have approved laws and amendments banning the recognition of gay marriage. Florida is one of them.

Roberto Rebosso, manager of the Marriage License Bureau of Dade County, said gay couples came down to the courthouse to get married even before Bush's announcement, but Florida doesn't recognize same-sex marriage and employees have to follow state statutes. 

Sophomore Renee John Williams, an international business major said the legislation should promote equal rights for everyone. 

"States should not dictate who should be married," Williams said.

Chelsea Boehme, President of Stonewall Pride Alliance, a gay and lesbian club, also believes the state is standing in the way of people's rights. 

"It's kind of ridiculous that in 2004, gay people can't get tax and insurance benefits that straight married couples do." 

At first, she believed that South Florida is liberal because it has a large gay population. But recent events changed her mind. 

"The State of Florida is more conservative. Clearly it is a very anti-gay state," said Boehme. Jorge Casas, president of the FIU chapter of Delta Lambda Phi, a gay fraternity, said gay marriage should not be looked at as a special right but as an equal right. Casas said that for many years, the gay community has battled stereotypes of promiscuity and an inability to maintain monogamous relationships. Casas wants the community to break what he says is "a terrible, false stereotype."
"We are asking to be recognized just as other relationships are recognized. I believe gay marriage is a matter of equality." 

Casas said, "Denying this basic freedom to 10 percent of the population takes away a basic American principle and that is the pursuit of happiness."

Boehme claimed that until you have friends  who are gay, you really don't understand the gay person's perspective.

Headline: Life is a...Cabaret
Subheadline: Show vibarates with energy
Author: Hansel Castro / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Wilkommen, bienvenue, welcome. I imagine most reviewers of Kander and Ebb's classic "Cabaret" are tempted to begin their review in a similarly corny fashion, and I've never been one to resist temptation. The musical will be playing March 11-14 at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, and it is a beautiful test of the FIU Theatre Department's ever-expanding skills.

A cynical homage to Weimar-era Berlin decadence, "Cabaret" finds its source material in the stories of Christopher Isherwood, who captured both the beauty and the savagery of the years leading to the Nazi party's ascension in Germany. 

Originally staged in 1966, the show went on to gain even greater fame with the 1972 film adaptation, directed by Bob Fosse and starring Liza Minelli as the irrepressible Sally Bowles. Also successful was the daring 1998 revival directed by Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall,   (of "American Beauty" and "Chicago" fame, respectively.)

While the FIU production is not quite radical enough to erase all those memories, it does offer one of the most ambitiously fluid set designs the theatre department has ever attempted, as well as a wide assortment of scantily clad women. 

Because, after all, that's what "Cabaret" is about: scantily clad women.

Well, no, there's also a plot, involving Cliff Bradshaw, (Kristian Cardenas), an American writer who spies Berlin with the wide-open eyes and ears of a first-time novelist looking for inspiration and finding only the din of night clubs and the flirtatious banter of the above-mentioned scantily clad women. Inspiration does arrive eventually in the shape of Sally Bowles (Carolyn Zeller), an enthusiastic singer of philosophical looseness.

Their relationship is as doomed as the glitzy world in which they find refuge, but that's perhaps inconsequential because it's clear they never quite belong together. 

The heart of the play rests in the relationship between Fraulein Schneider (LaVonne Canfield) and Herr Schultz (Zee Garcia), an elder couple that draws tenderness from such mundane subjects as food shortages. Indeed, together they sing what's probably the most moving song ever written about pineapples.

Canfield's singing is particularly poignant in the twin odes to resignation, "So What" and "What Would You Do?"

But the show's not-so-secret weapon is Ricky Waugh as the Emcee, that nebulous raunchy and paunchy figure that welcomes everyone to the decadent stage with the promise that inside, "life is beautiful." Surrounded by dancers, Waugh's Emcee is endlessly protean, a panderer one second, a humorist the next; he's always both hilarious and heartbreaking.

Also notable in smaller roles are Vladimir Berrios as Ernst (Cliff Bradshaw's ally of sorts), and Lisa LaGrande as Kost (a promiscuous boarder that manages to exude a threatening sexuality which ultimately provides a catalyst for action.)

"Cabaret's" climax has always been the title song, with its refrain of "Life is a cabaret, old chum, so come to the cabaret." Unfortunately, Carolyn Zeller ain't no Liza Minelli, and she doesn't have the vocal power to turn the song into the show-stopper that it fully deserves to be. 

Out of context, it is defiant in the carpe diem vein; in context, it signals the character's foolish refusal to accept the reality of the Nazi threat. The trick for a performer is to convey both the triumph and the despair in the song, and Zeller is only partially successful.

 Luckily, there are many other musical standouts: the opening song, "Wilkommen"; the raunchy "Don't Tell Mama"; "Two Ladies," a celebration of threesomes that is virtually guaranteed to send you off humming; the comical "If You Could See Her Through My Eyes," which turns menacing in the very last line; and the eerily beautiful Fascist anthem "Tomorrow Belongs to Me," one of the more subtle moments in the Kander and Ebb songbook.

How can the Sally Bowles of the world survive while the storm troopers gather around? Can illusion provide a shelter from the horrors of war? Is art an escape from life, or an escape into life?

 The play's ultimate questions are left for us to answer, in a chilling closing scene that finds the audience applauding while the cast, glares, defiant, in tears.

Headline: "Hidalgo:" Refreshing role for Mortensen
Author: Maggie Perez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
There is much more to "Hidalgo," Joe Johnston's epic adventure tale, than meets the eye. On the surface  it may appear as a movie about a man, his horse, and a grueling race against time in the desert. However, once one scratches the surface and sniffs what the movie has to offer, a message of friendship, loyalty, and self-worth shines through.

During the 1800s, Frank T. Hopkins (played by a very blond Viggo Mortensen) was the greatest endurance rider to ever tread on American soil. In earning this title, he attracted the attention of Shiekh Riyadh (Omar Sharif), and was invited to participate in a 3,000 mile  race, named the Ocean of Fire, which runs across the Arabian Desert. 

The Ocean of Fire was a challenge limited to the finest, purest Arabian horses ever bred. The Arabian horsemen viewed the idea of an American and his impurely bred Mustang, Hidalgo, as blasphemous. With all the odds against him, Hopkins was determined to not give up.

It was refreshing to see Mortensen sans the dark hair, piercing sword, and entourage of hobbits. His portrayal of Hopkins was charming and humorous. But the movie finds its emotional center in Hopkins' horse, who proves to be his strongest companion and support. Anyone with a pet or love for animals will understand the bond between the two.  

What makes the film beautiful is not the gorgeous, yet daunting scenery of the desert or the excellent acting by Mortensen and company; it is not the colors adapting to each feeling expressed in the movie, ranging from the vivid oranges, reds, and blues of the desert to the pale blues, grays, and yellows during Hopkins' greatest moment of desperation. 

Rather, the beauty lies within the message that despite one's feelings of inadequacy, great things may be accomplished once belief in oneself is exhibited.

Dear Editor:

I think it would be important for the newspaper not to forget about the University's Graduate Schools.  For example, the FIU College of Law participated in a national competition, received second place, and the Beacon failed to take notice.  It's sad to say that some students don't even know that FIU has a Law School.

It would be important for the FIU Community at Large to know about ALL of FIU's achievements, not only those of the undergradute students.
