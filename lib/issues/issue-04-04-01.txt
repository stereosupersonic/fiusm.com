Headline: Graduate Art students discuss their final work
Author: Albert Bell Toral, Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's Frost Art Museum is currently displaying the work of 5 graduate students in PC 110. This exhibition is the final requirement needed in order to obtain a Masters of Fine Arts degree. It also represents an opportunity for the students to gain some practical experience within the field: Selecting which works would be best appreciated, installing them with little outside help and feeling the many emotions associated with the exhibition process.

In relation to this exhibition, the museum will be hosting two other events. The first one, to take place from 8-10 p.m. on April 2, is the opening reception. On April 7, the MFA graduates will host another event at the museum's Wednesday After Hours starting at 7 p.m. It is here that they will take turns speaking about their various pieces.  

Artist Judith Blumenthal, whose three 2004 exhibits center around the sleeping process' subconscious hardships, will be explaining that "though we have come to view the bed as a sort of comfort zone, in reality, it's not that at all because once a person falls asleep, he or she can't control whatever awaits them and they are stranded in this atmosphere with no one to turn to."

Blumenthal's project consists of several beds that are not topped by the usual mattress, but rather by objects such as pins, bricks and soap. These objects are representative of deeper worries and stresses blocking our way to a good night's sleep. Some of the beds already have indentations left by "the sleeper," a conceptual figure meant to reflect the passing of time and the continual striving toward an unattainable goal.

Another artist on display in this exhibit is Colombian-born Mauricio A. Ramirez. His Phyletic Evolution, a piece inspired in part by his family's meat marketing business, hopes to achieve a level of awareness on its audience by presenting them with intense photographs of meat's developmental stages.  Meat, blood, light sources and simple household materials were the primary elements used to explore the intricacies of animal flesh in this beautifully grotesque aim to create an appreciation of meat's aesthetic beauty.

"People consume massive amounts of meat on a daily basis, but most of them have no sense or appreciation for where it all comes from. That is why I spent the past two years photographing the process, so that I can show the meat-eater the side they never get to see of the thing that they eat so often," noted Ramirez.

The largest exhibit featured at this event, however, will be courtesy of artist Gretchen Scharnagl. Making her fifth appearance at the place formerly known as the FIU Art Museum, she has managed to amass a good number of discarded Christmas trees and make a faux forest out of them.  Once you work your way through this cluster of hanging trees, you will then arrive at a dimly lit ledge full of actual bird carcasses. For those who happen to look past this unusual collection, a series of holes drilled into a wall will await the curious. However, what does it all mean?

"Everything I have ever created has to do with human behavior. I don't want to get too much into detail for fear of distorting somebody else's interpretation," proclaimed Gretchen, "however, I will let you in on what this display means to me. The forest reflects life and finding your way through it, the fallen birds are indicative of nature's failures, and the holes are made for attracting human curiosity."

Also featured at this year's exhibition will be Julie Lopez's large variety of small drawings, paintings, ceramics and objects found around her house, all of which explore the beauty of a distinct landscape.  Lastly, Barbara Rivera is introducing a collection of paintings hoping to liberate the female figure of the popular Victorian paintings from the rigid stereotypes that have turned them into icons. The Spring 2004 MFA Exhibition will run through April 9, 2004.

Headline: Actors earn chops keeping up with hit FX series Nip/Tuck
Author: Glenn Garvin/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Dylan Walsh and Julian McMahon were, well, perplexed. They thought they'd signed contracts to star as plastic surgeons in the grisly but definitely land-based TV show "Nip/Tuck." But somehow they seemed to have landed in an episode of "Sea Hunt" instead. Why else would they be floundering around at the bottom of a swimming pool with 50-pound weights strapped under their surgical scrubs?

"The things you'll do to be in a hit TV show," McMahon sputtered, rubbing his eyes from the chlorine in the Albion Hotel's pool.

"Yeah," gasped Walsh, blowing water out his nose. "Ryan (Murphy, "Nip/Tuck" executive producer) is back there in L.A., cackling and saying, 'I told you they'd do it. Send 'em to Miami for a week, they'll do anything.'"

Fear not. "Nip/Tuck" is not adding Jacques Cousteau and a pod of baby whales to its cast. Walsh, McMahon and other cast members were visiting Miami Beach to shoot promos for the show's new season, which kicks off in June on the FX cable network.

"Nip/Tuck," which features the gruesome adventures of a couple of neurotic, philandering and generally unglued plastic surgeons whose patients are all either lunatics, gangsters or both, is as twisted as anything on television, so these were no ordinary promos. 

When the swimming-pool footage of McMahon and Walsh finally turned up on television last week, it looked like they were floating inside a giant breast implant, thanks to computer manipulation. There is not a long tradition of using breast prosthetics to promote TV shows, but nothing to do with "Nip/Tuck" surprises Walsh and McMahon anymore. Or, more precisely, "everything" surprises them. "It happens to me literally every episode," says McMahon, who plays Dr. Christian Troy. "The one where I slept with the old lady to settle a malpractice suit. Or when I took the priest hostage. The one where the corpse head was yelling at me. Or the season finale, where I'm waiting for my baby to be born and it turns out to be black."

Whenever they go out in public, McMahon and Walsh are bombarded with questions by "Nip/Tuck" fans who are anxious to know exactly what new depths can be plumbed by a show that has already featured self-circumcisions, teenage three-ways and heroin smuggled in breast implants. 

The actors say they're always the last to know.

Beer trucks or no, both actors are eager to start seeing "Nip/Tuck" scripts again. Like most cable series, it has a shorter season (12 episodes last year, 16 this one) and a longer production break than TV shows on the broadcast networks. Walsh and McMahon haven't been in front of the "Nip/Tuck" cameras since September.

"This has been the longest break I've had since I've been in the business," says McMahon. (Though he acknowledges it wasn't all break he did some television work in his native Australia and made the horrifying discovery that he can no longer speak in an Australian accent.) "I'm ready to get back to work.

"It might have been too long of a break, except that the 12 "Nip/Tuck" episodes we shot were some of the hardest work I've ever done. Not only are we shooting twice as fast as network television, and not only were Dylan and I in almost every scene, but on this show, you're always on the verge of a breakdown."

Walsh logged heavy camera time when he starred in the cop show "Brooklyn South" and that was a broadcast show with a full schedule of 22 episodes but he says "Nip/Tuck" is far more exhausting.

"On 'Brooklyn South,' I did a lot of scenes where I was walking up stairs. Or walking down stairs. If I had dialogue, it was 'Hey!' But on `Nip/Tuck,' every scene is crazy somebody's dying or breaking up their marriage."

Headline: A virtual fixation: computer game 'The Sims' still sells like hotcakes
Author: Peggy Rogers/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
Little virtual people in little virtual homes, "The Sims" are so lifelike that players of the personal-computer game often fashion characters after themselves.

Some have rewritten their own troubled childhoods and marriages.

And some take their frustrations out on the little people.

"Two of the most fundamental truths about people is that we love to create and we love to destroy,'' says Jon "PyroFalkon'' Habib, who writes a free and popular strategic "Sims" manual posted on many Web sites. "There's always a new way to create a family. And, of course, there's always a way to burn, electrocute or starve'' a Sim.

"The Sims" is the nation's top PC game for the fourth year running, and the even more realistic "Sims 2" is expected to be released this year. The game, created by the Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts, has sold more than 28 million copies worldwide and been translated into 17 languages. The expansion packs feed this popularity and the surging sales.

In "The Sims," which has spawned the creation of seven best-selling games that keep expanding play, the players create characters that they name, dress, assign personality traits and color to, and build homes for.

One woman scripted a game based on her sister's life, mirroring her entrapment in an abusive marriage and her eventually successful efforts to free herself.

Wedner Charles, 19, calls it "a very, very creative game,'' one that's "real lifelike and entertaining.'' After selling the game by day at the Best Buy in Aventura, Fla., Charles says, he goes home and plays "The Sims" almost every night.

His main character, named Wedner Charles and modeled on himself, often goes out on the town.

"I go downtown, and I'll greet the women, and I'll talk to them,'' Charles says.

The player must tend to "The Sims"' every need  and needy they are.

While you can assign them some free will, you must steer them to socialize, make meals, have fun, surround themselves with possessions and make it to the bathroom in time. Should they wet their little Sims pants, they'll suffer great embarrassment and need to be hoisted into the shower.

You must also make "The Sims" practice such job skills as cooking (by reading books) and mechanical ability (by toiling at a work bench) to get ahead at work and be able to buy more expensive possessions. Sims who grow too depressed stop obeying their players' orders and can even die.

Starting with the originally rural, cul-de-sac setting, the packs have introduced wild house parties, hot downtown dates, a sweeping vacation resort, movie and music studios that create Sims superstars and pet shows, the latter in an expansion game called Unleashed.

"I actually tried to bribe the Wal-Mart clerk to try to get the Unleashed expansion pack a few hours before midnight when it came out,'' says Juliet Violette, of Las Vegas, who describes herself as "a 33-year-old mom who is hooked on "The Sims."''

"When "The Sims:Hot Date" came out, my 5-year-old daughter and I sat in the store and watched the FedEx truck unload,'' she says. "We weren't about to wait any longer.''

Players steer Sims by highlighting characters' heads and clicking on objects or other characters. Click on a refrigerator, and a Sims can eat or serve a meal or grab a snack. Click on another Sims, and your highlighted character might hug, kiss or compliment the other one or talk, brag or even propose to it.

But you often cannot predict the outcome. The second character might slap the original, who might burst into tears.

Players gather around hundreds of fan Web sites and chat forums, where they talk like lifelong friends, form clubs and download 10s of thousands of characters, furnishings, prebuilt homes and possessions custom made by other players.

One participant, known by her screen name of Raveena, has created 1,264 items that have been downloaded more than 22 million times at www.thesimsresource.com, according to the Web site's count.

Many observers point out that Sims players form valuable friendships and communities. 

And sociologists and industry experts say people can learn about juggling the elements of their lives from such simulation games.

"It's literally a test drive: You can do whatever you want, and there's no danger,'' said Richard Ow, game-industry analyst for the NPD Group, a research firm.

The game is taken so seriously that, though it creates characters in light, medium or dark skin, it has been criticized for creating too many white ones.

And some women have complained that while male Sims come in many shapes and sizes, too many female Sims have Barbie-like proportions.

Defenders say there are technical reasons for a white-skin majority and point out the players create most of the characters.

"This is like a sandbox,'' Sims producer Tim LeTourneau says. "You can build your own sand castle.'"

Headline: Writer enjoys the lush life
Author: Alexander Blanco/Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
"I fought against the bottle 
But I had to do it drunk. 
Took my diamond to the pawn shop 
But that don't make it junk."
-Leonard Cohen


I was inspired to write a column on drunken literary figures some time ago, to wile away some useless hours that came my way during a dry spell.  But it seemed my stouthearted intent for the writing of the thing far surpassed any true stoic execution of it.  I was all talk and no type.  

All purpose and no practice.  No strings pulled me fingertips to write the damned thing, no puppeteer to encourage my movements.  

So, I didn't write it.  Not a single word, jot, or tittle of it.  And if ever I were to blame something or someone beyond myself for my own inactivity, well, I blame sobriety.

You see, Bacchus has nurtured many of my insights ranging in time from those early, awkward teen years on up until these final collegiate months. I was drunk when I first made love; I was drunk when I first finished writing a story; I was drunk when I chose to get this damned degree in English. 

All in all, a grand total of a good inelegant decade I owe to the miasma of a good drink, I'd say.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.  

Life got in the way of my studies for a while and I got to shunning the bottle. Then writer's block got in the way of my writing, and I got to drinking less than nothing.  I was experiencing one of those errant moments of elucidation kin to Joycean epiphany when truant talent blames its lack of creative discharge on a lack of attributed gray matter.  

Rilke wrote, "if you can see a life without writing, then do not write."  I could not.  

So, I took the long way home, and got back to drinking.

You see, like Señor Tom Waits says, the apotheosis of all apostolic alcoholics, "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy." 

On my good days, I know exactly what he croons about.  But on my bad days, I get to asking rhetorical questions.  

Do you know what writer's block feels to an aspiring writer who doesn't believe in writer's block?  

How can you tell him there is such a thing if he has never experienced it himself? 

It's kind of like telling him about the joys of making love.  You can tell him it's great, feels good, kin to a thousand suns going supernova in his groin, brother only to bliss in sublimity, sister only to rapture in its pleasure.  

Yes, you can say all that, and he might even get down on his knees and start to believe, but he still won't know what you are talking about until he's made some sweet lovin'. Because love is all in the making, and writer's block, for a writer, is all frontal lobotomy.

So, there I was, probably perched on a table outside the Graham Center or behind the Green library, girl-watching and sippin' overpriced coffee, when the answer came to me:  I'm not a writer with a drinking problem, 

I'm a drinker with a writing problem!  

The Modern Literary Canon is a virtual roster of drinkers with writing problems. 

From Papa Hemingway to Southern Willie Faulkner, Truman C. to J. Genet, Jackie K. and Norman May, the best literature written in the previous century probably had more whiskey stains on the rough drafts than all the bottles of wine that were once water could spill.  Aside from the Romantics, I would bet my mother's soul that the Modernists imbibed more than all of the Canon combined! And if I have ever aimed to be anything in this life it is to share in spirit or in flight the same feelings they felt while behind the typewriter, with pad and pen, or pencil and notebook.  

In light of this epiphany, I took up the bottle and, lo and behold, I am writing again.  Not that I ever stopped, though. Nope, never did cease to type away on my lil' laptop.  It was all a state of mind-type-thing.  

True, everything I churned out during my drought was unworthy of even the basest of scriveners.  

It was more like I was typing on a delinquent font, in felonious bold type. Sort of like Octavius hacking away on Courier New instead of Times New Roman, if you catch my drift.

All in all, what you read here is what I felt like typing one day after a girl-watching session, and after several of my other columns had been constructively criticized to death.

Headline: Rouco returns to revive FIU men's basketball program
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a 26-day search, FIU President Modesto Maidique and Athletic Director Rick Mello introduced former assistant Sergio Rouco as the new head coach for the men's basketball program on Monday.

This will be the third stint at FIU for Rouco, who left last spring to become an assistant at the University of Texas El Paso. Rouco was an assistant coach for coaches Rick Walker and Bob Weltlich from 1987-91 and under Donnie Marsh from 2000-03. The hiring of Rouco is expected to help in the recruiting department due to his strong reputation as a recruiter both nationally and internationally, one of the main reasons Mello felt Rouco was the right man for the job.

"It was very important for me that our program take it to the next level. We had to capture South Florida," said Mello.  "That not only means student athletes at the high schools here but also our community, and Sergio Rouco can do that for us."

Last season, Rouco helped turn UTEP around from a 6-24 record in 2003 to winning 24 games and an NCAA Tournament appearance this past season. Mello believes Rouco's year at UTEP will help him enormously at FIU.

"The period at UTEP was very important because he went there and was a major reason in one of the biggest turn arounds in NCAA history, because what happened at UTEP needs to happen here. That experience at UTEP really served him well as we went through our search of candidates," said Mello.

It will be a homecoming for Rouco who grew up in Miami, where his family resides. Rouco also coached at Miami Norland from 1991-1995. Coming home was a key factor in Rouco's decision to accept the job at FIU.

"Words can't describe the way I feel. Having the support of the president and athletic director here at FIU and my family, there is no doubt this program can't go to the next level. I want to have FIU in the tournament year in and year out," said Rouco.

Despite having the pleasure to come home and be with his family, Rouco's main goal for coming is to put FIU on the winning side.

"I am not coming here to come back to South Florida to be with my family. I am here to win a championship. If we did it at UTEP coming from a 6-24, we can do it in Miami. My dreams are higher than winning the Sun Belt Conference," said Rouco.

President Maidique  hopes that the hiring of Rouco will bring success to the basketball program here at FIU, a dream he has had for a long time.

"I had a dream, that the basketball program here at FIU would win year in and year out and, most often than not, go to the tournament, and I know that's going to happen under Rouco because he promised me and I believe him that he will deliver," said Maidique. 

"The man that is going to make my dreams come true here at Florida International University will be Sergio Rouco."

Maidique credited the coach's character as another reason he should succeed at FIU.

"There are two things that are essential to be a good coach, and one is unimpeachable integrity.You have to be absolutely honest and our new coach is a man of integrity. Integrity opens the door, but what gets you though the door is passion and committment. You have to love what you do and you have to really want to be successful at it and I think that's the kind of coach Sergio Rouco is," said Maidique.

But one of the biggest challenges for Coach Rouco and the basketball team will be to attract fans to the Golden Panther Arena.

"We are going to play basketball the way it's meant to be played. We're going to play aggressive, fast, fun, but the ultimate thing is we are going to play to win. Nobody wants to come to watch a team that doesn't win. We need to get people in the stands, but they need to have a good product to come to see. And we will have a good product, and with that Dr. Madique, I will not let you down," Rouco said.

Rouco is taking over a team that has lost 20-plus games in each of the past four seasons. 

Despite being the new coach, Rouco was instrumental in recruiting many players still on the team including Carlos Morban, Marcus Robinson, Raphael daSilva, and Gabriel Lazo. For players like daSilva and Lazo, they welcome the addition of Rouco, who they believe is a great coach and person.

"This is a great fit for us. There is no person out there better than Sergio Rouco for us. He is a person who recruited a lot of us on the team and I feel good about it because we like his style of coaching. All the guys are excited because everybody likes him. He's a great person and the best thing is that it's not going to be somebody really new for us," said daSilva.

"It was a good decision made by the staff. He's not only a great person but a great coach and he will get us players that will help turn around this program," said Lazo.

Rouco will now have the opportunity to work with daSilva and other players he recruited that he didn't get a chance to work with. Returning to these players made the decision easier for Rouco.

"It's hard to leave a place, especially a kid like daSilva who was a freshman and I didn't have a chance to work with. It was hard leaving the seniors like Belco Bamba and Junior Matias. When the decision to come back was made possible, it made it easier for me to have the opportunity to come back and coach with them. It's really exciting," said Rouco.

March 24 - FIU 5, UM 4

The Golden Panthers defeated the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes, 5-4, to win the season series 2-1 at Mark Light Stadium.

"We were excited because it was the last game before conference," said Jeff Skellenger, "It was definitely a big game for us."

Despite beginning the game with a strikeout in the first inning, FIU produced five straight hits including an RBI double from freshman Cody Jacobs, a two-run double from Fernando Alvarez and an RBI single from Jeff Skellenger, giving the Golden Panthers an early 4-0 lead. It was the most runs FIU has scored in the opening inning this year.

The Canes rallied in the second inning with an RBI double from Gaby Sanchez and cut the FIU lead to 4-1.

The Hurricanes came within one run at 4-3 in the sixth inning on an RBI single by Adam Ricks and an RBI groundout by Erick San Pedro.

But it was FIU's defense - turning four double plays - that prevented Miami from capturing a lead. It was the most double plays turned against UM since May of 2000.  

FIU avoided Hurricane rallies in the fourth, seventh and eighth inning to preserve the win.

"We were trying to get our momentum going for the whole weekend," said P.J. Lehmann. "We had a lot of confidence going."

Added centerfielder Dennis Diaz: "We really wanted a win and we knew we had to play extra well."

FIU sent five pitchers to the mound with sophomore Frank Gonzalez (2-0) picking up his second win and junior Danny Hernandez pitching two scoreless innings for his third save of the season. Hernandez, who celebrated his 22nd birthday on Tuesday, got a strikeout and a double play to prevent UM from scoring.

"We wanted to prove that our first win wasn't a fluke," said Diaz.  

March 26 - FIU 7, UALR 1

Despite two rain delays, FIU defeated Arkansas-Little Rock, 7-1, in their Sun Belt Conference opener on Friday at University Park Stadium.  

The victory raised the Golden Panthers record to 16-16 (1-0 SBC), reaching the .500 mark for the first time this season.   

"We have been playing really well as a team and we have had good pitching," said Skellenger.

The Golden Panthers were led by Yahmed Yema, who hit a grand slam, his team-leading sixth home run of the season, giving FIU a quick 4-0 lead.

The Trojans stayed in the game with back-to-back singles, scoring a run and cutting FIU's lead to 4-1.

After the first rain delay, the Golden Panthers extended their lead to 5-1 in the bottom of the third on a single by senior Fernando Alvarez and a pair of wild pitches by UALR starter Kenny Geiersbach.

Following their second rain delay, the Golden Panthers scored another run on a Mike Lopez groundout. The senior outfielder led off the inning with a double down the right field line for his second straight multiple-hit game and fifth of the season.

"We saw this game as our new season," said Diaz. "We really needed a conference win and everyone knew it," said Dennis Diaz.

FIU starter Derek DeCarlo pitched six strong innings and raised his record to 2-5 on the season. He closed out the game with three strikeouts, recording his career total to 215 and fifth-place all time at FIU. 

Juniors Jon Banke and Leo Calderon combined to pitch a scoreless eighth and ninth to preserve the win.  

"This time, we've learned from our mistakes and we took advantage of them," said Diaz.

March 27 - FIU 2, UALR 1

The Golden Panthers finally got over the .500 mark with a 2-1 win over the Trojans at University Park.

"Today was a big game," said Dennis Diaz. 

"It was definitely the most important day to get a sweep."

Despite a slow start, the Golden Panthers took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the sixth inning on a Dennis Diaz single through the left side. The speedy Diaz moved up on a sacrifice bunt by Lehmann and then recorded his 24th consecutive stolen base.  

"I was very excited, but I really didn't know I had that many," said Diaz.  

He later came around to score on a sacrifice fly from Yahmed Yema, giving FIU the early lead.  The Trojans waited until the eighth inning to tie the game on a RBI double by J.J. Yant.   

Still in the eighth inning, with one out, back-to-back singles by Cody Jacobs and Yahmed Yema put runners on first and second for FIU. Following a strikeout, Brian Aragon knocked home the winning run with a single. 

"He did good," said Skellenger. "He got the winning hit."  

Throughout the game, FIU's shortstop Luis Rivera played outstanding defense, as he saved a pair of early Arkansas-Little Rock threats with his glove in the third and sixth inning. UALR had the bases loaded again in the seventh inning. However, the Golden Panthers turned their third double play of the game to end the threat on another play by Rivera and second baseman P.J. Lehmann.  

FIU starter David Asher pitched six strong innings, scattering seven hits and striking out three. Junior Danny Hernandez raised his record to 3-0 with three innings of relief for the Golden Panthers. 

"A lot of things are finally going good for us as a team," said Diaz.

The win was the fifth in a row for FIU (17-16).

"We have been playing so well. Now we have to keep it up," said Lehmann.

March 28 - FIU 6, UALR 4

The Golden Panthers extended their winning streak to six games, sweeping Arkansas-Little Rock, 6-4, on Sunday at University Park.

The victory sets the stage with a 3-0 mark to start off Sun Belt Conference play and improves FIU to 18-16 for the season.  

"It's awesome to start off with a league winning streak," said Jeff Skellenger.

FIU took another early lead as usual in the first on an RBI single by P.J. Lehmann, who has found a way to get on base in all 31 games so far. Lehmann's single scored Dennis Diaz.

"I just go out every game and do what the coaches tell me," said Lehmann.

Stretching their lead to 6-0, FIU picked up two RBIs on singles from Jimmy Bacon and Adrian Casanova.  

The Trojans avoided a shutout in the seventh inning, scoring four runs.

"They were starting to come back and we just thought it would be great to get a sweep," said Skellenger.

Seven different Golden Panthers recorded a hit, including Diaz, who notched his 26th straight stolen base. 

His record matches an FIU record of 26 held by Ken Adderley in 1985. 

"I just go out there and play and try not to think about it," said Dennis Diaz.

Starting pitcher Andrew Edwards (4-1) had an outstanding day on the hill, pitching a season-high seven and two-thirds innings, striking out five batters and allowing only three hits.

"When you go out and think of the team, good things happen," said Diaz.

Headline: Football holds first spring practice
Author: Nikolay Orekhov/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Monday marked the opening day for the 2004 FIU football season with the first spring practice. The team came out in helmets and shorts and concentrated mostly on individual drills and technique. 

"The main concern for this spring is improving technique and avoiding injuries," said head coach Don Strock.

The coaching staff will try to limit injuries by spending more time on individual drills.

"We had a lot longer individual periods than we will have in the fall, working on routes and different techniques by defensive backs, especially on defensive pursuit and getting after the ball," said coach Strock.

Despite the conservative approach, two players were injured. Running back Adam Gorman sprained his left hamstring, while receiver Andre Rollins suffered a left shoulder sprain. Both players are listed day-to-day.

Speaking of the injuries, Jaime Burke, who started at quarterback in last seasons opener, remained sidelined. He is still recovering from a torn right ACL, which took place in the first game of last season.

Burke will miss the entire spring practice and plans to return for the fall practices.

With Burke sidelined until fall, it is up to redshirt sophomore Josh Padrick to keep his starting job for the upcoming season. Padrick put together a solid season last fall filling in for the injured Burke and is hoping to use that experience to improve this year. 

"I just want to improve and get better at reading defenses," said Padrick. 

The team shifted to a 4-3 scheme, which the coaches believe will improve the rushing defense. 

"Our goal on defense is to improve on third downs and make opposing teams kick field goals," said Strock.

Overall, Strock was optimistic and enthused about the team's first spring practice of 2004.

Headline: Dazzlers dance their way to Nationals, aim for Finals
Author: Nikolay Orekhov/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
They danced. They jumped. And they twisted, dazzling the crowd with glamorous costumes and an electrifying dance routine Monday night at the Golden Panther Arena.

The FIU Golden Dazzlers performed one last time before heading off to Daytona on Wednesday morning, where the team will compete in the National Championships Friday night. 

The invitation to the competition is a bright highlight to a season full of hard work and grueling practices.

The Dazzlers will be attending the Nationals for the second consecutive year, and "the immediate goal is to improve on last year's 14th place finish," said head coach Brenda Popritkin.

Although improving on last year's performance would mean a great deal, the team wants to do even better than that and finish as one of the top teams.

"The team is really looking forward to finishing in the top 10 and earning a trip to the National Finals," said team captain Monica Sotolongo.

The actual rehearsal for Friday's competition contained a variety of advanced dance moves to go along with the high-energy music.

"The team is having a lot more fun this year as opposed to last, with the music and dance routines being much more open and trendier, whereas last year's routine was more conservative," Popritkin said.

Regardless of what happens this Friday at the Nationals, the team is proud of their accomplishment. 

"This year has been a lot of fun and excitement for us. We have a talented group of girls here, and we achieved and surpassed all of our goals and expectations. There will not be any disappointments," Popritkin added. 

As for the future, The Golden Dazzlers will be holding auditions on April 18 at 9 a.m.
