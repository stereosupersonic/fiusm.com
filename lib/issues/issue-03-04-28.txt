Headline: Greeks hold events for graduating members
Author: Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
At graduation time, most organizations simply say their farewells to graduating members at their yearly formal - others go beyond that.

Alpha Xi Delta, a sorority also known as AZD, does quite a few things for their graduates.  Aside from a ritual that they say is secret, AZD also hosts a sleep over, which they call Senior Send Off.

"We will definitely have tons of fun, but it is also a time to bond and say goodbye to our sisters after four years of hard work, involvement, and philanthropy," said senior Griselle Diaz, AZD president.

The evening's events  include the secret ritual ceremony, games, a parody of senior members, and seniors verbally bequeathing items and memories to undergrad sisters.

Continuing with tradition is Sigma Phi Epsilon, a fraternity better known as SigEp. SigEp conducts a ceremony that they call The Hoop of Steel, which is held at their Silver Knights Ball, which corresponds to their yearly formal.

They have a hoop of steel with personalized charms on it. 

As each member graduates, his name goes on a charm, and it is then added to the hoop. 

"The point is for everyone to have their own charm on this hoop of steel," junior Alex Corzo said. "It's a nice tradition because then when you come back as an alumni, you can see that your name is still on the hoop."

Pi Kappa Alpha, a fraternity also known as PIKES, has a secret ritual for its members and alumni. Aside from that, members have get-togethers, such as the one former President Victor J. Ortiz is planning. 

"I am going to have a BBQ at my house with family and friends," Ortiz said. 

Sigma Alpha Mu, known as Sammy, also hosts a secret ritual, which, members would not disclose to The Beacon because of tradition. 

Still, President Edgar de la Calle said that he cannot wait to go through it and experience the ritual for himself. 

FIU's Greek Honor Society says their farewells at their last meeting of the semester.

"We give out pins and certificates to show our appreciation [for] their dedication," said senior Maria Garcia, GHS president.

Graduation events are important for seniors,  Greek Affairs Coordinator Karen Katz said. 

"These senior activities add closure to the college experience and help motivate our seniors for success in their future endeavors," Katz said.

Greek organizations give more than just nice goodbyes and memories. They can also give members something to look forward to, even after everything is said and done.

One such case is that of Ortiz, who may attend the University of Miami for free or little cost because of his PIKE membership. He received a letter from the dean of students stating that there was an opening for a faculty graduate advisor.

"If I were to become a faculty member, I would get 7.5 out of nine credits paid for," Ortiz said. 

"PIKE, and the Greek life itself, play lifetime roles that can lead to opportunities such as the one I have been fortunate to come across."

As they say their last goodbyes and give out their hugs, these Greek members know that they have much more to look forward to because of their affiliations, whether it'd be through an alumni chapter or a connection. 

"When we say goodbye, it's not really farewell, it's just until we meet again," Katz said.

Headline: Honors College awards graduate student
Author: Tuere Allwood/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In between raising a family, painting, and pursuing a career in print journalism, 44-year-old graduate student Wendy Smith has done it all at FIU.  And she is not done yet. 

Smith, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mass Communications in Dec. 2002, was recently honored by the Honors College with the Fernando Gonazalez-Reigosa Award - the top award that is to be given to a graduating senior who demonstrated outstanding academic performance as well as outstanding citizenship within the Honors College and wider community.

"[Wendy] is smart," Fjellman said.  "She is creative.  She is very much a Renaissance woman; able to think, write, create art, organize and lead."

Smith was a student in Fjellman's third year Honors College seminar, "Aesthetics, Values, and Authority," in 2000-2001.  She also ran the Honors College discussion board on responses to the tragedies of 9/11, a web site called Scratch or Scar that could be accessed through the home page of the Honors College.  Smith collected data and responses from a number of American, as well as European newspapers.  

The site intended to help the American people understand the conflict from different perspectives, according to Smith.  She said she wanted to create a diverse picture and so tried to focus some attention on Islamic students who were going through rough times in America due to 9/11. 

It was mostly for the creation of this web site that Smith received the award.

"We gave her the FRG award because she was the best candidate. There was no competition," Fjellman said.

As a non-traditional student, Smith expressed her happiness to have surpassed the challenges that she faced at the start of her academic career.

"I can't stress how blessed I feel to have the opportunity to be doing so well in school at my age," Smith said.  

Her proudest accomplishment is writing stories that are  well accepted, and being able to say that she represents FIU, Smith said.

"[FIU] is a university that is accessible to everyone, and if I can do it, I know anybody can," Smith said.

"It used to really bother me that I never finished my education when I was younger," she added.  "It plagued me, actually.  So I jumped at the opportunity to go to school here."

Smith began junior college in 1978 as a fine arts student in Canada, her homeland.  Still, she was not able to pursue her education due to lack of transportation. 

She finally returned to school, one marriage and two children later, to receive an Associate's degree from Miami-Dade Community College, and then go on to graduate Magna Cum Laude from FIU.  Smith is currently in her first semester as a graduate student pursuing a master's degree in English.

Cynthia Penny, Smith's best friend who also completed the journalism program at FIU last Fall, said Smith's appetite for learning, academia, and competition is her reason for success.

"Wendy is driven to succeed," Penny said. "She is a talented painter, a mother, and an energetic and involved person. She's also beautiful, funny, emotional and driven to over achieve. School is like a drug to her; she craves it."

Smith's achievements within the past four years alone include illustrating a cookbook for the consulting chef of Carnival cruise line, writing for the Palm Beach Times, the Naples Times and The Miami Herald.

Smith also won the Janet Chusmir Memorial Scholarship, which is the highest scholarship awarded by the School of Journalism and Mass Communications.

According to Fjellman, Smith's success is not limited to the Honors College and FIU.

"Wendy Smith is such a good student and citizen that she enhances the reputation of the Honors College merely by saying publicly that she is an Honors College student," Fjellman said. "Wendy has been a superb student in the past. She will be a great professional and intellectual success in the future."

Headline: FIU Career Services helps students, alumni in job hunt
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Carlos Hernandez, a senior graduating this Spring, decided to register with InterviewTrak, an online job recruiting system offered by FIU Career Services. 

His decision paid off. After filling out the appropriate forms and applications, Marriott Hotels & Resorts interviewed and hired Hernandez. 

"After this semester ends, I'll go to Marco Island for a few months of training," Hernandez said. "Then I'll either come back here and start working [in one of their hotels] or stay in Marco Island for a little while [for more training]." 

A number of graduating seniors choose to utilize the Career Services office, located in GC 230 at the University Park campus, WUC 255 at the Biscayne Bay Campus, and EAS 2780 at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. 

"When a student is looking for a position, thousands of other people are also sending in their resumés," said Olga Magnusen, the director of University Park Career Services. "A resumé endorsed by InterviewTrak has an edge." 

Of the approximately 3,200 seniors graduating from FIU this semester, only 1,343 are registered with the Career Services office, said Leslie Deehl, the assistant director for Career Services on campus recruiting. 

"Students either haven't heard about us or believe that we only service students with high GPAs or those pursuing certain majors," Magnussen said. "Both of those beliefs are false. We have opportunities for people majoring in everything from religion to engineering."

IBM Corp., General Motors Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are just a few of the companies that recruit potential employees from FIU, Deehl said.

Companies come to FIU for two major reasons: diversity and location, Deehl said.

"When companies want and need diversity, they come here," explained Deehl, noting the fact that 56 percent of the student population at FIU is Hispanic, with dozens of other nationalities present as well. 

Many local companies prefer to recruit students from Miami because they are familiar with this area, Deehl said. 

"[Career Services] is beneficial for your future as a student at FIU regardless of your major," said senior John Singh, who plans on graduating in Spring 2004.

A student can take advantage of the free opportunities and services that Career Services has to offer simply by visiting the office or its web site at www.fiu.edu/~career. 

Workshops covering interviewing skills and salary negotiations are also available to FIU students throughout the school year, free of charge. 

 Students can also set up an appointment to seek help on writing resumés or do a mock interview with a career counselor or an actual employer. 

If students are more concerned with their postgraduate career, they might consider purchasing the Golden Panther Services package. 

With this package, students pay a one-time fee of $20 to gain unlimited access to InterviewTrak, which allows them to view exclusive FIU job postings and sign-up for on campus interviews and also refers their resumes to potential employers for their entire FIU career and one year thereafter. After that, alumni must pay $55 annually in order to continue using the service.

Many web sites unaffiliated with FIU, such as the Job Web (www.jobweb.com) and the Career Toolbox (www.myfuture.com/career/interest.html) offer additional leads for job hunters. 

Career Services offers a semi-annual Career Fair, where local and national companies send representatives to FIU to recruit potential employees. 

In order to prepare themselves for their postgraduate careers, many students participated in internships for a semester or year at FIU, sometimes for a grade. 

"I interned in the Management Information Systems at Jackson Memorial Hospital and got a lot of experience outside of the books and classroom," said Kadeon Thomas, a senior graduating this Spring with a degree in management information systems and Spanish. 

Deehl advises seniors who will graduate next Fall or Spring to visit Career Services sometime in the summer before their senior year or, at the latest, the first week of the Fall semester.

"If you miss the deadline to post your resume with InterviewTrak, you're missing out on a big opportunity," Deehl said.

In order to seize their ideal postgraduate career, students are advised to start making use of Career Services in their sophomore and junior years.
