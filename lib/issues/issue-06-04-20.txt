Subheadline: Baseball drops two games to conference leader
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The baseball team lost two games out of a three-game series to Sun Belt Conference leader Troy April 14-16 at Riddle-Pace Field in Troy, Ala.

The Golden Panthers dropped their record to 26-15 (7-5 SBC), while the Trojans improve to 27-10 (8-1 SBC).

The Golden Panthers return to University Park Stadium after a six-game conference road trip to face another SBC opponent, Louisiana-Lafayette April 21-23.

"When you're on the road it's tough to sleep sometimes," said outfielder Chris Dunn. "We're eating lots of fast food and stuff like that. It's just a comfort factor being at home. The outfielders know the outfield and the infielders know the infield."



TSU 12, FIU 6



The Trojans recorded 12 runs on 16 hits in the victory, living up to their reputation as one of the best offensive teams in the nation.

FIU starter Walker Whitley picked up the loss. Despite allowing three runs in the fourth inning and five runs in the fifth, the redshirt junior was sent out to pitch the sixth and seventh innings. Whitley allowed all 12 runs (10 earned) and all 16 Trojan hits in six and one-third innings pitched.

Outfielders Bryan Pullin, James McOwen and Chris Dunn and first baseman Michael Lopez added two hits each. Designated hitter Yosvel Barosso went 3-for-4 with two runs scored.

After a scoreless game through three innings, McOwen hit a solo homerun in the top of the fourth inning to give FIU an early 1-0 lead. 

The Trojans returned the favor and added three runs of their own in the bottom half of the inning.

The Golden Panthers cut the lead to one run in the top of the fifth inning after an RBI sacrifice fly from Michael Lopez.

Troy seemingly broke the game open in the bottom of the fifth, scoring five runs, to make the score 8-2.

After Troy made the score 9-2, FIU clawed back in the seventh inning with four runs of its own - highlighted by a two-RBI single from thirdbaseman Nick Cadena.

However, the Trojans finally put the game away after scoring three more runs in the bottom of the ninth.



FIU 9, TSU 5



The Golden Panthers gave Troy its first Sun Belt loss of the season with the help of six runs in the first inning.

"We ended their winning streak, which is great," said FIU staring pitcher Chris Siebenaler. "It helps with out RPI which also helps us get into a regional."

Siebenaler earned the win, pitching five and two-third innings, allowing four runs, seven hits, striking out two and walking two batters.

Frank Gonzalez came in relief of Siebenaler and pitched the final three and one-third innings to earn his fourth save of the season.

FIU scored six runs in the first inning - highlighted by two-RBI singles from Dunn and Barosso. 

Troy stayed alive in the bottom of the first after scoring three runs and that was the last time it would threat.

"I just made some adjustments after the first inning and put the cruise button on after that," Siebenaler said. "Maybe I got a little too lax, giving up three runs in the first inning, but it's always good to score first."



TSU 7, FIU 4



Despite having an early 2-0 after the first inning, FIU dropped the rubber match  thanks in part to a Trojan four-run fourth inning.

FIU starter Kyle Preshong got this loss after allowing five runs (four earned) in four innings pitched. The sophomore struck out two batters and walked five.

Dunn and Cadena both went 2-for-4 and combined to drive in three of the Golden Panthers' four runs.

Headline: Don't believe the critics: Heat will win championship
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's playoff time again and just like clockwork, it's time for new speculations to be brought in as to why the Heat won't win a championship. I, for one, don't believe the hype that Miami is "leaking oil" coming into the final stretch and will not get past the Pistons, I have a much more positive outlook.

Ever since the three-team trade that sent Eddie Jones to Memphis, Rasual Butler to New Orleans and Jason Williams and James Posey to Miami, the popular belief around the sports nation has been that Pat Riley went overboard in the off season and did not get the right pieces.

I think the pieces fit just fine and the Heat not only have a good chance of beating the Pistons, but of getting over the hump and winning it all.



 A GOOD SEASON DESPITE 

A ROUGH ROAD



If the Heat wins its final two games, it will finish 54-28, win its division by a hefty margin and have the number two seed in the Eastern Conference and probably the fourth best record in the NBA.

To many, that has provided a reason to believe the Heat will falter in the playoffs, but I think it's a great achievement, considering what they've had to go through during the season.

From last year's 15-man roster, eight were newcomers that had to play together in-order to get accustomed to one another, but they never got much of a chance because of all the injuries.

Jason Williams missed streaks at a time with nagging tendonitis in his knees.  Shaquille O'Neal missed almost the first half of the season after messing up his ankle in Indiana and was really slow in coming back. Michael Doleac and Shandon Anderson missed time in the beginning of the year with back problems. James Posey just came back from a torn Achilles and missed part of the beginning of the year with a broken pinky and Alonzo Mourning is currently on the sideline where he has missed twelve games.

Add to all that a dramatic coaching change in the beginning of the season and I would call this .650 winning percentage a success. Let's just remember, the Pistons were exactly 54-28 last season and they went all the way to game seven of the NBA Finals.



SHAQ WILL BE JUST FINE



Another popular criticism for the Heat has been the "sudden decline" in Shaquille O'Neal's play.  Many around the league say he's overweight, hurt and too old to produce at the level to which we've grown accustomed.

Although he's averaging a career-low 20 points and nine rebounds in 30 minutes per game, I have every reason to believe he will be dominant again in the playoffs because of how he's stepped up in times he's needed.

In his four games against Detroit this season, O'Neal is averaging 28 points and makes the 240-pound Ben Wallace look like a nagging mosquito in the low post.

As O'Neal gets older, he gets smarter and learns more about his body and how to take care of it. Last season, he wore down during the playoffs because he played in 73 of 82 games and averaged almost 35 minutes. This season, O'Neal and Riley have made it a point to monitor his playing time to stay away from injuries in May and June.

He has nothing left to prove. All he wants to do is win a championship and all the analysts that have said he's on the decline will be in for a shock when the playoffs kick off April 22.



BEST BENCH IN THE NBA



I'm sure you can get our second string players to make a starting lineup and they'd be good enough to lock up a playoff spot in the dreadful Eastern Conference. The fact of the matter is that the Heat bench is better than any other team in the NBA.

Alonzo Mourning - who will be healthy for the playoffs - is one of the best centers in the NBA. Throw that in with a future hall-of-famer in Gary Payton and Antoine Walker who is finally starting to adjust to the offense and you have an eight man rotation capable of winning a championship.

The best thing about these last, meaningless games has been the extended playing time of this bench and the realization that any of them can be ready to play at any given time.  With Zo missing time lately, Michael Doleac - who hasn't played all season - has been right up to par with what he brought last year.  New addition Derek Anderson has proven to be the perimeter shooter we've been lacking and Shandon Anderson brings the perimeter defense we've needed to shut down the game's great scorers.

Even Wayne Simien, the Heat's first round pick out of Kansas, has shown veteran poise and the ability to play when needed.

Although teams don't tend to go too deep into their bench during the playoffs, a good eight man rotation is vital for any team's success and the Heat have the best in the business.



THE ABILITY TO BEAT 

THE TOP TEAMS



Miami's 3-11 record against the other top-five teams in the NBA (Pheonix, Dallas, San Antonio, Detroit and New Jersey) may not prove my argument, but I believe the playoffs will be a different scenario.

What happens when you get a group of veterans together is that it becomes really hard to get them motivated for the regular season. These guys have been there year after year and they find the 82-game season very tiresome.  That's why against the worst teams in the league, you'd find the Heat down 20 at halftime only to come back and win the game in the final minutes.

These guys need excitement and the playoffs will provide the stage for them to exert the energy they've been bottling up and make a push for a championship.

The recent claim that New Jersey can stand in the way of another Heat-Pistons matchup is just ridiculous. In a seven-game series you need a lot more than a great back court and a small forward. The Nets have no bench whatsoever and no front-court players that can guard O'Neal.  

I refuse to be influenced by what happened in the regular season, because they were just trying to learn to play together and stay away from injuries - nobody wants another '05 when D-Wade, Shaq and Udonis Haslem were all hurt to start the playoffs.  

Starting April 22, everyone will have a clean slate and it is the grittier, battle tested and play-off pedigreed team that will prevail. 

I pick the Heat to win a championship this year not because of the offseason acquisitions, but because at the end of the day, they have the two best players on the court no matter who they play. I'll take that against anybody.

Headline: DVD Wars
Subheadline: HD-DVD leads Blu-ray disc in war to succeed DVD
Author: Luis Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Many of us may remember the time when we had video cassette players. At that time, there was the format war between VHS and Beta. Now in 2006, a new format war will decide the successor to DVDs. On one side, we have HD-DVD, backed by companies like Microsoft and Intel. HD-DVD is also currently recognized as the official successor by the industry's DVD Forum. 

Its opponent, the Blu-ray format, is being championed by Sony. Both formats have been quick to gain supporters in the movie industry and, with the advent of next-generation game consoles, in the video game industry; this new format war will not be limited to just movies at home. 

Sony is planning to implement Blu-ray into its upcoming Playstation 3 and Microsoft has announced an HD-DVD add-on drive for its own X-Box 360, though it will not be used for gaming. Looking at this situation from a gamer's perspective, it's really hard to see how this will affect my choice of format.   Chances are, I will own both a PS3 and a 360. Since both systems will be supporting the opposing formats, it really won't make much of a difference yet unless one format clearly pulls ahead of the other.  

After looking at both formats, it would seem that Blu-ray has the technological advantage. More storage, scratch resistance and massive support help make it a solid choice. 

HD-DVD simply seems like a more advanced answer to standard DVDs, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It will hold more data, has major backing from Microsoft and is cheaper. Moreover, if I had to pick one right now, I would have to go with HD-DVD. 

HD-DVD and Blu-ray have very similar features. They are both the same size as current CDs and DVDs. Both have movie playback and data storage functionality. 

HD-DVD and Blu-ray players will work on any TV and will be backward-compatible with current DVDs. Both support HDTV for a crisp, clean picture with up to 1080p resolution. From these factors alone, HD-DVD and Blu-ray don't look that much different from each other, but there are major differences.

One of the differences between HD-DVD and Blu-ray is storage space. A dual-layered HD-DVD will hold up to 30GB of data. Dual-layered Blu-ray discs, however, will hold 50GB. Another difference is Blu-ray's durability, thanks to TDK Corporation's Durabis polymer coating. 

With this added protection, Blu-ray discs are much more durable and less susceptible to scratches than current CDs and DVDs. HD-DVD does have an advantage in costs, however. The first Blu-ray players will cost about $1,000, while HD-DVD players will be around half that price.

All the Blu-ray features sound great, but I wonder if it's moving too far, too fast - to where it won't be cost effective for producers and consumers alike. With HD-DVD, there's no need for all-new manufacturing equipment. An upgrade would suffice. 

One thing to remember is that in these format wars, technological superiority does not always guarantee victory. For now, the upcoming war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray is looking to be a competition in which there will be only one winner.

Ultimately, time will tell which side will win the disc format war. While it may take several years for one side to show a clear lead in the market, there are still many other factors, such as movie rentals, popularity and so forth, that could sway the consumer in either direction.

Headline: Summer jobs offer countless opportunities
Author: Maria Chercoles / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As summer approaches, many students who don't work might be considering taking a seasonal job to save some money for a new car, to do some traveling or just to save enough money to enroll in the Fall semester.

If you keep an open mind, the choices for an out-of-the ordinary summer job are endless. For example, you could spend your summer working in France doing customer service in a train station. This summer, before you go solicit at your nearby music store, here are some fun summer jobs to consider:



Work on a cruise ship



You will travel to different countries and meet all sorts of people while working in a friendly environment. There are experience-required positions such as ship photographer, animator, newsletter writer or fitness instructor as well as less specialized positions such as waiter or cashier. 

These jobs are well-paid and provide room and board. Another plus is that international students can be legally hired. Find out more at www.cruisejobline.com.



Work for a non-profit organization



If you are socially conscious, there are different alternatives depending on what interests you.

One option is to help the elderly or the homeless or to work with health issues by joining organizations such as Dialogue Direct (www.dialoguedirect.com) or the Community Partnership for the Homeless (www.cphi.org.)  

You could also work for an environmental organization such as Campaign to Save the Environment, which is currently advocating against oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge region and is offering fundraising summer positions in 29 states. 

Find out more at www.jobsfortheenvironment.org. Also, check out the Clean Water Action 

(www.cleanwateraction.org.)



Work as a Summer Camp counselor or resort guide



If you are passionate about the outdoors, this is the right job for you. Most locations are in national parks such as the Alaska Kenai Peninsula, giving you full contact with nature. 

Counselor positions require experience with kids, but you can also work as a horseback riding instructor, safari guide or nature educator in a camp or resort. 

Accommodations and training are usually provided. CPR certification is a must, which you can get at most local hospitals. Check out www.backdoorjobs.com and www.coolworks.com. If you can't go too far, FIU also runs a summer camp. For positions, inquire at the FIU human resources office at www.fiu.edu/personnel. 



Get work experience abroad



During summer, English-speaking employees are in demand in countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain. Opportunities include working as a waiter, bartender, lifeguard or receptionist. 

If you know the history, you could work as a city guide. Check with their embassies for visa requirements. Also, consider that most jobs don't provide for traveling expenses, although they might provide accommodations. Check out the websites www.summerjobs/do/where and www.seasonworkers.com. 

If money is not an issue for you, you could also volunteer abroad in countries such as Peru, Brazil, Thailand or Costa Rica. Choices include working in housing projects, teaching English or educating about AIDS/ HIV. Find out more at www.crossculturalsolutions.com.



Consult FIU Career Services



If you want experience in your field, you should contact the FIU Career Services. Even if you don't want the usual job, don't discard this search option; you never know what you can find. 

There is a onetime fee of $20 to access its job database, but you can also obtain daily postings at their office. A schedule for workshops on how to get summer jobs and internships will be available soon, so keep checking with them at www.fiu.edu/~career. 



Some advice before you do anything



Most importantly, consider what you expect to get from your job. If your priority is financial, maybe it's better to work for a restaurant than for a non-profit organization. Look for jobs that allow you to put your educational training in use. 

Also, be honest about your qualifications; if you are not very patient with kids, no matter how exiting working in a summer camp sounds, this might not be the job for you.

Whatever you do, remember it's all about having fun. However, don't let the enjoyment get to you: Keep in mind you must come back to finish your degree.

Headline: Not The Libertines but good enough
Author: Laura Catherine Jokisch / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Americans may recognize the name of Pete Doherty as the present boyfriend of supermodel Kate Moss, but before his battle with drug addition landed him in U.S. tabloids, he fronted The Libertines alongside Carl Barât. 

Their combined antics, vices, and complex relationship were the fodder of a seemingly unending procession of rumors and books but, in the United Kingdom, their music captured as much interest as their personalities. 

Critics hailed them as the saviors of London punk and their singles consistently climbed the charts across the pond. But the same dysfunctions that grabbed the public's attention would ultimately tear the band apart.

After Doherty dropped out of his Barât-prescribed rehab regimen, skipped out of tour date after tour date and broke into his fellow bandmate's home, bodyguards were needed in the recording sessions to prevent Barât and Doherty from physically assaulting each other. Doherty was finally given the boot in 2004 and the two frontmen went their separate ways. The Libertines were no more.

After the over-produced disappointment that was Down in Albion, Doherty's Babyshambles' debut, all eyes are on Barât's new line-up (which retains Libertines drummer Gary Powell and guitarist Anthony Rossomando, with Didz Hammond of Cooper Temple Clause on bass) to fill the hole left by The Libertines' break-up. Despite their vacation from the music scene, their old post still fit like a glove.

Dirty Pretty Things couldn't have chosen a better intro for Waterloo to Anywhere than "Deadwood." Its energetic vocals, bouncy guitar lines and brisk drum beats accurately foreshadow the infectious album that follows. 

Their first planned single "Bang Bang You're Dead" follows suit, commanding attention with Barât's signature vocals that perfectly balance nonchalance, intelligence and pretension as they blast over their frenetic backdrop.

"Gin and Milk" and "You F--king Love It" stand out as the highlights. Hammond opens the latter at breakneck speed and retains back-up vocals throughout the track, which is sadly the shortest of the album. In spite of the hyperkinetic pace, it manages to leave the audience wanting more without leaving it behind.

"When You Love A Woman" - a confusing ramble that would sound natural blaring from the stage in a malodorous dive - has the most personality on the album, but also is the least accessible. While Barât's sloppy, half-drunk lyrics and uncharacteristic whining spikes in pitch are a welcome change, his instrumental backing follows his lead and eventually devolves into noise. 

The sprawling melodies of "The Gentry Cove" and "Wondering" play more like Doherty-penned tracks than Dirty Pretty Things originals. 

The weakest points are found in "The Enemy," an exercise in unpleasant repetition, and "Last of the Small Town Playboys," which fails to find its identity in its dragging three and a half minutes.

"B.U.R.M.A." is a strong exit that showcases the band's versatility and maturity. Bleeding from ballad to punk and back, the theme behind it is reminiscent of some of The Libertines' best without actually channeling their own ghost.

Dirty Pretty Things isn't The Libertines, but they're certainly the next best thing. They've retained everything that fans loved about the now defunct outfit - minus Doherty, of course. But without Doherty's heroin-fueled weird streak, the latest from the remaining members plays a little stale. 

As Barât's creation, the core sound is intact and in full force, but Doherty's nervy romanticism is sorely missed as the freshest hooks it originally served.

Fans of their previous work will be far from floored, since Barât is essentially recycling himself, cleaning up the rough edges that were Doherty's stamp. However, devotees should be more than satisfied with the reincarnation. It certainly surpasses Down in Albion in every way - though, in Doherty's defense, at least he was treading new territory.

Besides providing lingering Libertines fans with their fix, the album doubles as a perfect introduction to the update on the genre left behind by English greats The Clash, The Kinks, and Morrissey.

Headline: University gear hits local Champs, Lids stores
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If you have recently walked into a local Champs Sports store, you may have noticed the addition of FIU merchandise among the displays of college sporting goods. Students no longer have to purchase their FIU athletic apparel solely at the campus bookstore: University caps and T-shirts are now available at select Champs Sports and Lids stores across South Florida. 

"Since about 18 months ago, we have been in the process of making our merchandise available outside of campus," said Gregg Fort, associate athletic director for external operations. "On the FIU athletics website, we announce what local stores are stocking the new apparel so students don't end up going to random stores and finding nothing."

Within the last two months, a major advancement has occurred in the process of making University apparel readily available in the community. In February of 2006, Adidas and FIU announced a four-year partnership that makes Adidas the official provider of FIU athletic apparel and affect the availability of the University's athletic apparel in South Florida. 

Currently, five local Champs Sports stores are stocking FIU merchandise: Dadeland Mall, Miami International Mall, Aventura Mall, Southland Mall and Pembroke Lakes Mall. 

According to Champs Sports employee Richard Richard, the Miami International Mall store has been selling FIU merchandise for over a year.

"We've had FIU Merchandise on sale for a little over a year, but our stock of FIU items is really small compared to that of other universities," Richard said. "Right now, we're only selling two types of FIU T-shirts."

Although the store has a limited amount of FIU apparel, Richard notes that the apparel is selling well. 

"We end up selling whatever FIU merchandise we get. If we get a shipment of T-shirts, we normally sell all of them within a certain time period," Richard said. 

At the Lids store in Dolphin Mall, University caps are selling moderately. The store only stocks one style of FIU caps, a style that features the words Florida International in blue with a superimposed panther head. 

Assistant Manager RJ Sharma believes that FIU caps have the potential to sell well if more styles become available. 

"The main problem is that we're only selling one type of FIU headwear while we have several University of Miami caps as well as Florida Atlantic University caps," Sharma said. "Instead of people buying the one cap we have in stock, more people are buying our customizable caps available with FIU logos." 

The lack of available FIU merchandise in local sporting goods stores can be attributed to the stores' buying cycles. 

"Stores stock merchandise based on buying cycles. When they want merchandise, they just don't go ahead and buy it right away. Buying cycles affect when merchandise appears in stores. Right now, the fall buying cycle is taking place," Fort said. 

As FIU apparel continues to appear in stores across South Florida, some people such as FIU Bookstore employee Elizabeth Vazquez are skeptical of the impact that the increased availability may have on sales.

"I don't think that increased availability will have much of an effect on sales here at the bookstore. The people who buy FIU merchandise are mainly FIU students, so it's convenient for them to stop by the bookstore and buy their stuff here," Vazquez said. 

Junior Justin Brown has a different perspective on the matter of sales impact.

"Having merchandise available outside of the bookstore is a great idea. These other stores provide students with cheaper alternatives that would increase sales significantly," Brown said. "Then again, we won't really know what's going to happen sales-wise until more FIU stuff comes out in stores later this year."

Headline: Artistic Expressions
Subheadline: Painting class teaches students basic techniques, creative risk taking
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
~ This is part five of a five-part series that features fun classes available to students. ~

Painting is known to be an art that expresses spiritual motifs, ideas and concepts. As taught at the University by the Art and Art History department, it is seen as an opportunity to explore a large range of possibilities. 

Painting I (ART 2500C), is an introduction through the individual understanding of the tools, techniques, materials and vocabulary of painting. Along with printmaking I, photography I and drawing I, is one of the classes recommended as electives for freshmen and sophomores.

"For some people it's just therapy. For others, it's a form of expression. For me, it's more about communicating an idea," said professor Helen Burgos. "Everyone has their own reasons for painting. It's about creating ideas and organizing things that are chaotic in life."

 Burgos, who has taught at the University for a couple of years, stated that most students enroll in the class for two reasons - as an elective or as stress relief. 

 Junior Jessica Gill, a liberal studies major, falls in the latter category.

"I can't go through a semester without enrolling in an art class. It's such a great way of relieving stress," Gil said. "I've tried almost all the different introductory art courses, including drawing and the 2-D and 3-D design classes, so I figured Painting was the next step."

Like Gil, psychology sophomore Nicole Escarpio enrolled in the class to balance the load of her other courses. 

"I've never taken an art class before, and I have a heavy science core," said Escarpio. "Taking this class was a contrast to my science courses - learning and having fun at the same time. I learned to take chances and to think outside the box."

Taking into consideration that most students in her class are non-art majors, Burgos emphasizes the "painty approach," recommending students to use thicker brushes because she believes beginners have a tendency to be rigid and are afraid to take chances.

Burgos stated that she begins each semester showing students a slideshow of collected artwork, which gives them insight on the theory of colors, mixing paints and the observing of still life.

"We learn how to paint in black and white and then progress to color," she said. "It's only after color that they move on toward concept art. Art is about identifying values and relationships between objects and developing a personal voice."

Sophomore Max Dudas, a science major, admitted the class was far more than he expected it to be, but found that he caught on to things quickly. 

"It taught me to get in there and not be afraid to try new concepts and ideas. There is no set right and wrong in art, as compared to math, where there is almost always a fixed answer," Dudas said. "I also learned to work with oil paints, which I had never worked with before."

In fact, oil is the only medium in which the class is taught. Burgos emphasized that it is much easier to teach a class using one medium. She also stated that oil, her preferred medium, is more traditional and has a long history in painting.

"I prefer oil paints because it's more flexible than synthetic paints or water- based paints," she said. "It's also more flexible in blending colors and it takes time to dry, so you can work with it."

Burgos stated that students are graded, most importantly, on effort. She also stated that attendance and technical and creative progress plays a large part in the final grade. Participation in group critiques also plays a role.

"Students are graded on effort because [they] have a wide range of skill," she said. "For example, a student who doesn't have much skill but puts a lot of effort will get a better grade than a skilled painter who is lazy. Effort counts."

Headline: Faculty Senate debates 3-day classes
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
A proposal to implement University-wide three-day classes has caused a heated debate within the Faculty Senate. 

The pros and cons for establishing this measure - which would add 50-minute classes on Monday, Wednesday April 18 and Friday - were discussed at the meeting along with extensive questions and concerns. 

The proposal was formed in response to a Board of Governors ruling that all PECO funding - funding given to universities for construction purposes - would be denied to universities that are not utilizing enough of their classroom space. 

The BOG, which oversees Florida's public university system, has not determined what the cut-off point for classroom utilization will be.

As of now, FIU is below the average level of classroom utilization when compared to other Florida universities. Currently, 42 percent of class space is used between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., although the data presented to The Beacon would not specify if this includes both University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus.

With the exception of St. Thomas University in Miami Gardens, FIU is the only university in the state that does not have three-day classes.

"Being average is okay - being below or at the bottom is not," said Bruce Hauptli, president of the Senate and professor in the department of philosophy. 

Once the faculty Senate takes a vote, Interim Provost Ronald Berkman will take that recommendation to President Modesto A. Maidique in order to make a final decision. 

Berkman assures that the changes will increase efficiency for the students being that, following the change to three-day classes, students will also be able to pick their schedule for the entire year as opposed to picking them one semester at a time.

This proposal could be implemented as early as Spring 2007. This would only affect Monday-Wednesday classes and would leave Tuesday-Thursday classes, evening classes and weekend classes as they are now. 

Members of the Senate addressed many concerns over the consequences of having three-day classes.

Professor Grover Larkins from the College of Engineering opposes the idea of three-day classes because of the attendance factor.

"FIU is different from other universities. 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. [classes] are solid booked. Sure you're trying to spread the pie by making 759 classes available but you won't be able to fill it," Larkins said.

Another concern expressed by members of the Senate is that it would take away time that is being used on Fridays for research and labs. 

"Each department has a different need and they should be addressed on an individual basis. We have faculty meetings, lab time with the students and research done - all on Fridays," said member Gautem Sen, professor within the School of Arts and Sciences. "One size fits all doesn't work with all departments." 

Student Government Association President Alex Prado expects a negative reaction from students.

"FIU is one of the few universities that always gets PECO funding and I think it would be detrimental to the University's growth, but at the same time we are one of the only universities in the state that lives in such an urban, metropolitan area that was founded to cater to the unique demographic of this community," Prado said in reference to FIU's predominant commuter student population.

Marie Zeglen, vice provost for planning and institutional effectiveness and chairman of the classroom space utilization committee that compiled the report on which the senate will be basing its decision, would not comment to The Beacon.

As of press time the Senate had not confirmed a date for whether they recommend or oppose the proposal.

Headline: 'SHE'S OUR FAMILY'
Subheadline: Custodian takes part in students' lives, education
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
When seven students needed housing, Esperanza De La Torre welcomed them into her home.

When students need advice and guidance, De La Torre is there.

When Greek members need assistance in the Graham Center, De La Torre tries her best to help.

De La Torre, GC custodian supervisor, has become a familiar face to students and faculty of the University.

"Esperanza is more than just part of the custodial staff, she's a part of the University, she's our family," said senior Christine Denton, who serves as Student Government Association vice president. "I consider her my home here and I go to her for a lot of advice and feel many students can go to her in that way."

De La Torre has been at the University since 1980, when University Park consisted of only four buildings: Primera Casa, Deuxieme Maison, GC and a small two-floor library.

Throughout her years at the University, De La Torre has been recognized with various awards, including the Presidential Award and the Distinguished Performance Award Division of Student Affairs.

Even though cleaning and supervising a night staff of seven is De La Torre's primary job, speaking and interacting with students is what she cares about the most. 

"Without students, there would be no University," De La Torre said. "Everyday I love coming to work because I love working for the students. This University is theirs."

De La Torre has worked in GC her entire time at FIU. This is where Ruth Hamilton, executive director of GC, noticed De La Torre's affect on students.

"Students like her because she doesn't see herself as a custodian," said Hamilton, who has been at the University since 1979. "She believes God put her here to help students with [their] development, fears and frustrations. If she had an opportunity, she would have been a therapist."

Taking the University home has never been an issue for De La Torre. She often assists students, including those in financial need.

Between 1983-87, she housed seven international students who could not afford housing. 

Students from Venezuela, Spain, Honduras and England were welcomed in her home to live with her own children.

"They would call me mom," De La Torre recalls. "I would take care of them but they would also help me take care of my children, who were younger. They were able to live in my house and use my car, and never once did I have a problem with any of them."

When Hamilton welcomes parents of international students who visit the University, they always ask for De La Torre.

"Esperanza helps international students adjust to this country," Hamilton said. "When parents of international students visit, the first person they ask to meet is her."

Every night, De La Torre puts out cookies and coffee for students studying late at night in GC. 

During hurricanes, she always volunteers to stay in GC and assist students.

"I wish we had a thousand of her," said Rosa Jones, vice president of student affairs and undergraduate education. "What makes her special is her passion for the students and the love she has for this University. She goes beyond her job description."

One of the serious issues De La Torre has helped students deal with is drugs and alcohol.

"She's very concerned about drugs and alcohol, especially after parties at Gracie's Grill," Hamilton said. "She has encountered students many times who were dealing with the temptation of drugs and alcohol."

De La Torre enjoys stepping in as a 'mom' to students.

"I am like a psychologist for the students," De La Torre said. "Sometimes they tell me that they wish I was their mom."

De La Torre loves the way UP has expanded with buildings across its campus. 

She credits current President Modesto A. Maidique -whom she said often sits down to eat with her in GC - with the development.

"He's given everything to FIU," De La Torre said. "Maidique has helped the University blossom the way a plant does. I'm so proud of the growth."

In five years, De La Torre will say goodbye to FIU, as she plans on retiring.

"I will miss the University," she said. "This is my house and the students here are my children."

FIU:

Rape suspect caught 

After an escape from the police, Carlos Garay was caught April 16 hiding in his parents' attic in West Miami. 

While Garay was missing, he was thought to be roaming around West Miami, near University Park, on April 13, which put the University on a state of alert.

FIU lobbies to sell land that doesn't belong to the University	

For the past two years, University administrators have been lobbying state legislators for permission to sell land that isn't University property, according to The Miami Herald.

The 26-acre state-owned land is located along the southeastern edge of the Biscayne Bay Campus and is worth about $100 million. 

Currently, egrets and mangroves inhabit the land, but mid-rise luxury condominiums could soon replace them. If sold, the funding would be used for student scholarships. 

In 2005, the University spent over $5,000 to survey the land and had University attorneys draft a proposal to insert in the state budget. 

The draft was denied and the University was advised not to attempt to obtain the land through the state budget. 

State Senator Alex Villalobos, who opposed the plan, said that the University didn't provide specific information about allocating the money from the sale toward scholarships. 

Paul Gallagher, FIU's vice-president emeritus and lead lobbyist, said that the project was "on the back burner" for now.  

This report was gathered from The Miami Herald.

Headline: BBC students express need for campus child care
Author: Yariber Faccio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Euridice Fuentes started her master's degree in investigative journalism at the Biscayne Bay Campus, she didn't have anyone to take care of her seven-year-old daughter while she attended evening classes. 

Fuentes is one of many students who are single parents at BBC, many of whom experience problems finding someplace they can leave their children while they study.

"I arrived in Miami from Dominican Republic with my daughter, and I didn't have anyone to help me. I'm also a person of scarce resources," Fuentes said.

Now a friend takes care of her daughter. However, her academic performance is affected when her friend can't look after her and Fuentes has to miss class. 

More than half of the nation's universities have childcare centers, according to the National Coalition for Campus Children's Centers. 

Even though FIU does have one at University Park, BBC, with a population of approximately 9,000 students and 1,000 employees, doesn't have one.

Janice López, associate director of the Children's Creative Learning Center, the equivalent of a pre-kindergarten at UP said that the main reason is that there aren't enough children to fill a center. 

Between 1987 and 1999, there was a CCLC at BBC like the one at UP, but the center was shut down.

"We had to close because we didn't have sufficient kids to sustain the cause,"  López said. 

Nevertheless, Ytaelena López, graduate representative of the Student Government Association at BBC, explained that what they probably needed was an exclusive place to take care of children, not a pre-kindergarten. 

This would lead to lower costs for the child care, and the students would only pay for blocks of time.

The CCLC receives funds from monthly payments made by the parents and from the Student Government Council budget.

From a budget of $1,401,791 gathered from the activities and services fees in 2005 through 2006, the SGA at UP allocated $10,000 for the center.

Also, students who received a Pell Grant were given a subsidized rate of half of the monthly cost.

In 1998, the United States Congress passed the Campus Child Care Supplement, which enables campus childcare centers to increase services for low-income students by offering subsidies and a sliding fee scale for childcare tuition, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

According to Janice López another reason for the lack of a childcare center at BCC is the difficulty obtaining the information that could help determine whether it would be beneficial or not to open a center at BBC, . 

Neither the Office of Admissions nor the Financial Aid Office keep count of the number of students who have children because that information is not asked for when students register or apply for aid.

Yasnica Heath, president of the Student Organization Council at BBC, said that the situation is sad because BBC is where the majority of the non-traditional students - meaning students older than 25-years-old who work and have children - attend.

Carole Boyce Davies, professor in the Department of African New World Studies, said that when pupils take their kids to the classroom, this brings about implications not just for the student, but also for the group. 

She explained that in a recent class, a student brought her baby with her, and that the noises the child was making would sometimes interfere with the class.

 "In that class, I would see the mother in four occasions get up and get out with the baby," Boyce Davies said. "She is a good student, but could not really follow the discussion, and as a professor sometimes you get lost, too." 

Ruth Duplessis, a nursing student at FIU who has a five-year-old child, said that her son gets affected each time she has to bring him with her to the library at night.

"I don't have anybody to watch him, so usually he is [in the library] with me all night long and it is hard to maintain a kid of his age calm," Duplessis said. 

Ytaelena López said that the university also gets affected with the situation. 

"Because a lot of people don't have a place to leave their children while they study, they take fewer classes, and this limits the applications to the University. This causes a loss of money in the registration process," she said.

Also, this could cause students to obtain lower grades, which isn't flattering for FIU, according to Ytaelena López. She is collecting signatures to make a proposal for a child care center for students and employees on campus. 

Janice López said that next fall, staff members from the Learning Center will open a child care center at the Graham Center at UP, and that they will try to operate it during the evening. 

"We still don't know the cost, but the students will be able to sign up their kids for blocks of time," she said.

Meanwhile, Euridice is preparing for the Summer semester.

"In the Summer, I will have to send my daughter to the Dominican Republic at least for two months, because the friend that takes care of her already has other plans and I have to take classes. It will be tough for me to be without her," she said.

Headline: Program helps create jobs for foreign nurses
Author: Bettina Lett / Contributing writer
&nbsp;
Although they started in 2005, it won't be long before Milton and Ana Castro obtain bachelor's degrees in nursing.

The couple is among 59 other students enrolled in the Foreign Educated Physicians Program, which began during the summer of 1998 and is approved by the Florida Board of Nursing. 

The program allows foreign doctors, such as the Castros, to earn certifications as registered nurses. 

The program allows the doctors to bypass the initial board tests that are required to get a practitioner's license without formal training in American universities, which would make it otherwise difficult, if not impossible, for some to practice medicine in the United States.

The School of Nursing does not offer the Foreign Physician program online. However, if a professor has a class at University Park, the class can be broadcast to students at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

At BBC, there are a few classrooms on campus that are specifically designed to allow students to pay attention to the professor and even participate in a classroom discussion without being in the same classroom as the instructor. 

There are also web-enhanced courses taught primarily in the standard classroom setting. 

Faculty members, such as Rosa Aponte, said that the students in the Foreign Physician program are modest and ambitious. 

"They are humble and they work so hard, because before they get into the program they go through several rigorous interviews," said Aponte, a former secretary of the School of Nursing who assisted the students in the program and now works in the College of Business at BBC. 

The students come from such countries as Peru, Cuba, China and some countries in Africa. 

With only 70 spots available, the competition is steep. Admittance to the program is offered once during the fall semester. 

The program lasts for five semesters and students have to sign on to work with a hospital after his or her graduation from the program. 

Currently there are 61 students enrolled in the program.

Not only are there academic qualifications required of the student, but the student must also adhere to the Nurse Practice Acts of the State of Florida, which allow no room for behavioral problems. 

The journey to becoming a nurse in the U.S. can be time-consuming. 

A potential nurse must obtain permission to work in U.S. before getting a license to practice. 

This process is completed after all of the certification courses and the NCLEX-RN examination - the test to receive a nursing license - which is conducted only in English.

A requirement of the program is that the students must be registered and practicing medical doctors in their own countries before being allowed to enter the program. 

A common misconception is that a doctor who comes to the U.S. and enters the program may go down a notch in prestige by becoming a nurse. 

The situations that cause the foreign physicians to leave their native country or state to enter the program shatter the logic behind most of the stereotypes surrounding the program.

"In Peru the medical schools have a lot of students graduating each year so the competition is high. This is not the same in the U.S., so there are more opportunities," said Milton Castro, a student of the class that began in the fall semester of 2005.

Milton does not plan to stop with a R.N.'s license. 

He plans to continue to become an M.D., as does his wife, Ana Castro, who is also in the Foreign Doctors program. 

Both students are medical doctors and originally from Peru. 

The decision to leave their home country to live in another to study medicine required determination and motivation. 

It can vary from person to person, but Ana and Milton Castro explained it in clear terms.

"[In the United States] you have opportunities or resources that are not available in our countries," said Ana Castro, who is also a student of the class that began in 2005. 

Milton Castro agreed. 

"In the United States, the medical research conducted and the resources used are more than what is done in Peru." 

The Nursing School program left  BBC for UP in December of 2004 and enrollment dropped significantly at BBC. 

Between the spring and fall semester of 2005, there were no classes offered at BBC by the School of Nursing. 

The Foreign Physician program is the only program in the School of Nursing that offers classes at BBC.
