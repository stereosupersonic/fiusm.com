Headline: Notorious BCS rankings still causing controversy
Subheadline: BCS computers making up for past mistakes with rematch
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Proof positive that the Bowl Championship Series rankings are rigged - and have more human influence than we would like to think - is in the fact that Ohio State and Michigan remained at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively.

Let's say, hypothetically, the FIU football team were ranked No. 1 (ha!) and Rutgers ranked No. 2. If FIU beat Rutgers 42-39 (remember, this is an extreme hypothetical situation) - like Ohio State did to Michigan - you better believe Rutgers would drop in rankings.

So why did Michigan remain at No. 2, leaving open the possibility of a rematch? The answer, like everything else involving college athletics, is money.

As much as I hate to say it, the BCS did the right thing. The rivalry between OSU and Michigan garners so much national attention even when both teams aren't in contention for the national title. So when they're ranked No. 1 and No. 2, the coverage will be overflowing.

The Nov. 18 ABC broadcast of the game pulled in a 13.4 rating. That means the game was watched in 14.96 million households across the country, making it the highest-watched college football game since Notre Dame hosted Florida State on Nov. 13, 1993.

You can thank all the pre-game hype for that. Now can you imagine how much more hype a rematch will get?

In a way, it is unfair for the other one-loss teams still in contention.  The BCS system is notorious because one-loss teams who lose early in the season have an advantage over those who lose near the end. However, there have been times when something similar to this year's predicament has happened.

In 2000, the University of Miami finished behind second-place FSU, which left UM out of the national title game. UM was 10-1 with its lone loss coming Sept. 9 to Washington, while 10-1 FSU had its only loss Oct. 7 against UM. 

So even though UM had its one loss earlier in the season and was directly responsible for FSU's only loss, it wasn't good enough for the BCS.

So what was the result? Undefeated Oklahoma running over FSU 13-2 for the national title in a low-rated snooze fest.

Let's fast forward to this year. As of Nov. 24, there are three other one-loss teams with a legitimate argument for taking that coveted No. 2 spot: Florida, Southern California and Notre Dame. By the time this gets published, either Notre Dame or USC (who play on Nov. 25) will be out. But just to cover my bases, if Notre Dame wins, it has no right at No. 2 because it was already blown out by Michigan 41-27. USC, if it wins, would have a more legitimate argument for No. 2. However, it lost to unranked Oregon State while playing in a weak conference.

As for UF, it also has a legitimate argument as its one loss came against Auburn, who lost to No. 6 Arkansas. But I think that Auburn was way overrated to start the season anyway.

I also think the BCS will know better than to commit the same mistake it did in 2000 and also in 2003 when Oklahoma, who lost in the Big-12 Conference Championship, remained No. 1 and got drubbed by Louisiana State. That year, USC was the odd team out and ended up sharing the national title with LSU (LSU received the BCS national title and USC received the less-famed AP national title), which is the equivalent of making out with your sister.

Barring any major BCS computer glitch (or the BCS market research team finding out that the country would boycott a rematch), this rematch is the best business decision the BCS has ever made. A game that was decided by three points in favor of the home team will now be played on neutral turf; it will definitely bring in more hype and fan fare.

Then again, we can have a repeat of the 1996 season all over again. FSU beats UF 24-21 in the regular season. However, both teams end up in the Sugar Bowl for the national title and the result was another unwatchable, lopsided contest - 52-20 in favor of the Gators.

If that happens this year, pretend you never read this.

Headline: Notorious BCS rankings still causing controversy
Subheadline: College playoff makes too much sense for BCS officials
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Here we go again.

Another Bowl Championship Series controversy and it was bound to happen.

There are two things that people look forward to this time of year: Thanksgiving and some coach or college football analyst calling for the whole BCS system to be revamped and suggest a playoff.

Officials claim that a playoff isn't possible because it would interfere with college athletes' academics.

Cry me a river, please. 

Division II college football teams manage to have a playoff as well as something called March Madness, right?

Let's keep it real here. This is all about money. Bowls receive millions of dollars from commercial contracts while universities and football conferences are award for their participation.

The millions of bowl games - such as the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl presented by Bridgestone or the Meineke Tire Bowl - played during the holidays were created to make money and stimulate local economies.

Last year's Orange Bowl between Florida State and Penn State paid both teams between $14-17 million, which they divided among other teams in their respective conferences.

So what's sexier, a Big Ten rematch for all the marbles or undefeated Boise State vs. undefeated Ohio State?

Despite USA Today and the Harris poll ranking Ohio State No. 1 and Michigan No. 3 in the nation, the BCS computers have both teams ranked first and second, respectively, after the Buckeyes defeated the Wolverines 42-39.

So when did computers start to run our lives? Last time I checked, we didn't live in the Matrix.

So what's it going to be? 

Take the red pill and just ignore what's going on and let Florida - who plays in the toughest conference in college football, the SEC - get snubbed because everyone's in love with the idea of a Big Ten National Championship game? Or take the blue pill and fight for a true championship game that would match up the top two teams in the country?

Any general practitioner would deduce from this year's college football season that Ohio State is the unquestionable No.1 team in the country and would prescribe that either UF or USC receive the No. 2 spot for all the BCS infected college football fans.

It would make sense for Michigan to drop below its current No. 2 rank in the country.

Consider this: UF will have played six opponents who are, or were, in the top 25 this season. The SEC is the deepest conference in college football this season with five teams in the top 25. So why don't they deserve a shot at the Buckeyes?

USC is in the process of rebuilding and their only loss comes at the hands of Oregon State. They have their own destiny in their hand with games against Cal and Notre Dame left on their schedule. An impressive 50-14 victory against No. 6 Arkansas should solidify their argument as long as they remain undefeated the rest of the year. And for all those who are arguing for Michigan to have a rematch against the Buckeyes, they had their shot and blew it. 

The game wasn't lost on the 15-yard personal foul for hitting Troy Smith when he was running out of bounds. They could have won that game if Michigan quarterback Chad Henne would have connected with a wide open Mario Manningham in the second quarter. That would have given them a 14-7 lead at that point.

Point being, the game wasn't lost on that one play, but this one game unfortunately lost them a chance to play for the BCS championship.

So here's he moment of  truth: blue pill or red pill, right or wrong, playoff or BCS? Let's at least get one thing right.

It's time for someone else to get a crack at the Buckeyes.

Headline: Senior will showcase skills after disappointments
Author: Patrick Jordan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Practice has just ended and many FIU basketball players are headed for the showers, followed by going out to eat, returning to their dorm rooms or various other activities.

However, Facundo Giorgi, a 6'8" senior from Argentina, is still on the court trying to figure out his next move.

It wasn't too long ago, though, that Giorgi was trying to figure out his next move on another field.

"Back home, the first present every kid has when he turns 1 year old is a soccer ball," Giorgi said.

Growing up in Argentina, where soccer is the most popular sport, Giorgi played it until the age of 10 before devoting himself fully to basketball.

Changing sports was not a problem with his parents, who wanted him to pursue his goals.

"They always supported me and always gave me the green light with my basketball decision, as long as I was responsible and I had a good time," Giorgi said.

Giorgi was a star basketball player in Argentina. A two time MVP with the Argentine under-18 national team in 2001 and 2002, Giorgi turned down several schools in order to attend FIU.

Despite his success in his country, his career at FIU has been anything but spectacular. 

Limited to 20 games last year due to nagging injuries, Giorgi averaged just 5.5 points per game to go along with 2.2 rebounds per game in his first season.

However, Giorgi's teammates have confidence that he'll be able to get the job done this year, especially his teammate, senior guard Johwen Villegas.

"We're good friends. We grew up being roommates and everything. He always works hard in practice. He just needs more confidence and to shoot the ball more," Villegas said following the Golden Panther's 74-61 victory  Nov. 18 over Alcorn State.

Giorgi also discussed the relationship the two have with one another, which dates back to their days playing together in a community college in Iowa.

"It is a great relationship. He was my first friend back in Iowa. We attended Southeastern Community College and since then we are pretty close. We always support each other in every aspect of our lives. We know each other very well inside and outside the court," Giorgi said.

Sergio Rouco, in his third season as the team's head coach, realizes Giorgi's potential and wants him to utilize his gifts fully.

Rather than play on the perimeter like Giorgi is accustomed to, he's been asked by his coach to become a presence in the paint, an adjustment for the senior.

"Facundo and [sophomore Alex Galindo] have been put in a situation where they're wing guys having to play the post. They haven't made any excuses," Rouco said, following the season opener. "They have to battle bigger guys. We try to use their skills to get big guys away from the basket.

"You see Facundo doing this. Now they're beginning to learn to wait their turn."

Rouco thinks rebounding is also a key for the team's success and Giorgi has been asked by the coaching staff to improve upon his previous numbers, as well as become a vocal presence for the ball club.

"I need him to be a little bit more of a vocal leader at rebounding and he has. He will with time. I'm happy with his progress," Rouco said.

Giorgi is also aware of the improvements that need to be made to his game.

"That's something that coach put on my mind to get stronger, to get in better shape because we don't have [former FIU forward Ivan Almonte] anymore," Giorgi said. "He averaged almost 12 rebounds a game, so I gotta step up - even the other the guards. I think everyone has to do a good job."

Working hard is nothing new to Giorgi either.

Beyond basketball, Giorgi is an Honor Roll student and he knows several languages.

"Besides English and Spanish, I can understand and speak some Portuguese, Italian and French," said Giorgi. "Now I'm being taught some Serbian."

Despite all of that, Girogi maintains that he is just a regular college student.

"I like to play soccer, listen to music and go out," he said.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: 'Put your money where your mouth is'
Author: John Radencich / University Librarian, Cataloging Department
&nbsp;
I would like to object to a cheap shot a member of the FIU administration made against the University's faculty and staff. In a University already suffering from a shortage of parking spaces for its employees, the proposal was made to take away even more spaces from the few that are already there. Once again, the University is taking advantage of its faculty and staff by raising money off its backs.

There are many objections that can be made to this program, but that is not what I am writing about. My concern is the way the faculty and staff are characterized by the Parking and Traffic Director, Bill Foster, when he said, "I'd like to see a member of the faculty come up to the administration and say, 'I want to stop selling these plates that raise funds for scholarship money because it's now harder for me to park.'" 

This is an unfair comment, as it makes it seem that any faculty and staff member worried about parking to be one of the bad guys who does not care for the welfare of the students.  It's a low set-up, making us look bad even before we have a chance to defend ourselves.

I note that there apparently is no provision for faculty and staff to purchase a license plate and with it upgrade to an administrative parking slot.  

Obviously no one in the administration is willing to help fund student scholarship money by making their limited spaces available for upgrading. Well, I say to Mr. Foster: "I'd like to see a member of the University administration come up and say, 'I want you to stop selling these plates that raise funds for scholarship money because it's now harder for me to park!'"

Put your money where your mouth is, fella.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Mainstream American will not endure Democratic ideals
Author: Julie Sierra / Senior / English Major
&nbsp;
In response to Chris Cabral's article, "Bush Must Cooperate with Democrats": 

1. Minimum wage: Why raise the minimum wage? It is basic supply and demand. If you artificially raise the price for labor, it will inevitably reduce the demand for it, creating unemployment, specifically in the lower-income brackets that most need these jobs. Republican priorities lie with America's hard-working people who understand decisions like wages are best left to the free market forces that inevitably do a better job at raising average wages than some socialist-based idea of Robin Hood justice.

2. Repeal tax breaks for oil companies: Why? Not enjoying the lower gas prices? What do you think taxing oil companies will do? It reduces their margins and increases the price of gasoline. Again, this is first year economics here, not rocket science.

3. Bush's stubbornness: What the Democrats call stubbornness is also known as leadership. While even conservatives may not always agree with every decision the President makes, we respect and admire his commitment to doing what's right, not what's up on the polls.

4. Respect: The same respect that Pelosi has given the President?  In politics, no one is winning any points for respect. Then again, maybe you should watch the Allen and Steele concession speeches. You could learn a thing or two about respect. 

5. Karl Rove and other relentlessly ruthless members of his administration: Are you talking about ruthless as in Fidel Castro ruthless, or Pol Pot ruthless? It's a pretty silly choice of words if you ask me. Push Bush to veto? Because all know just how quickly Bush is to veto every thing Karl Rove tells him to. Oh, wait - that's right, George Bush has only used his veto pen once in the last 8 years.

Unfortunately for Democrats, Bush probably won't use his veto pen enough, which will reveal to American voters exactly what Democrats stand for. You won this election not because you stand for anything most Americans agree with, but because the GOP lost touch with mainstream America's fiscal and social conservative values. 

But, that's ok. Democrats now have two years to show America what they believe in. Let's watch and learn ... it's not going to be pretty. 

6. Increasing financial aid for college students & expanding health care services: Right. Great excuse for colleges to raise their tuition prices - the government is paying for it after all - and so the quality and choices of medical services can continue to deteriorate. 

Government has no business meddling in such things. Consider carefully the consequences of the ideas and policies that Democrats are pushing.

Headline: Venezuelan presidents' politics are far from liberal
Author: Pedro Ross / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For many left-leaning youths here in the United States, Hugo Chavez has become somewhat of an icon, flaunting U.S. imperialism and free-market capitalism and setting himself up as the hero of the oppressed, third-world poor.

The truth is that Chavez's representatives here in the United States are aggressively trying to recruit liberal, sensitive and somewhat na've young people to join his crusade.

They enthusiastically join in, though for all the wrong reasons, seemingly entranced by the rock'n'roll-style aesthetic of this movement, with its Che Guevara t-shirts and its Rage Against the Machine albums.

Many so-called leftists in this country who support Chavez - along with his friend Fidel Castro - could well be confused by this movement's flashy, ironically commercial images instead of being genuinely attracted to Chavez's agenda.

These young people, if they consider themselves liberal, would do well to investigate Chavez and his cohorts' history, past their world of shallow images, and then decide for themselves.

Hugo Chavez has appointed himself as the new icon of liberal leftist consciousness. But does he really have an ideology, or is he just looking for attention? Lets look at his politics.

He claims that he is trying to help the poor.

However, his aggression against private business is driving out foreign investment in droves. 

Private businesses don't want to be nationalized, so they move their industries to other countries. This, in turn, has led to an escalation in unemployment rates.

This leaves the poor with one option: even if they want to work, they are forced to live on government aid.

Over time, this kills ambition and breeds apathy among the population.

This is another consequence of stifling private industry - it discourages innovation and risk-taking.

Everything about the population's lives is dictated to them by the state. Over time, they learn that, if they don't listen, negative things can happen. To support themselves, they have no other option but to follow suit, even if they disagree.

Chavez holds himself and his country up as an example for other Latin American countries. However, he can only get away with this because of Venezuela's huge position in the oil market. 

But what example is this giving to other developing countries who don't have this resource? In such countries, wealth must be acquired through effort and innovation, which Chavez is teaching them to frown upon. 

Chavez considers himself a liberal, but his friends in Iran and Cuba have actively pursued attacking free speech, religious diversity and political activism.

Doesn't being liberal mean being able to make decisions for yourself without being coerced and punished by the government?

In Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has actively pursued firing liberal and secular professors from universities, even though students have protested.

Not to mention Chavez's other best friend, Fidel Castro. Castro's agenda of arresting and prosecuting people who are trying to practice free speech and political activism in Cuba sets a poor example of liberal values. 

Given all this, it seems clear that Chavez is a liberal in nothing but name. 

Left-leaning students would do well to study Chavez and his friends' agendas and decide whether their habit of limiting and prosecuting those in their society who disagree with them is what they are about.

Headline: Class teaches Asian business techniques
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A Buddhist temple and a corporate business building are not usually associated, but Steven Heine, director of Asian studies, believes business students can benefit greatly from studying Asian philosophies in his Asian Values in Business (ASN 5991) class, a new class offered this fall that mixes eastern and western philosophies.

"The main theme of the class is connecting the art of war in business strategies," Heine said. 

During the average class, which aims to immerse students in the eastern way of looking at business, students go over various Asian philosophies including Taoism, Buddhism and Zen.

There are currently 26 students taking the class, which Heine selected from various applicants based on their experience and area of concentration, preferring business and Asian studies students, as well as international students.

"I think it was easier for me to get into the class because I'm an international student from Morocco," said graduate student Rim Hajji.

Even seasoned veterans of Asian business, such as Peter Levenda, are taking the class. Levenda has been traveling back and forth from Asian countries on various business ventures since 1984.

"The class is offering me a new perspective on what I've been doing for the past 20 years," Levenda said. 

Heine has written several books and his latest, White Collar Zen: Using Zen Principles to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Your Career Goals, published in 2005 helped him obtain the grant being used for his class, which he hopes will continue on indefinitely.

Beyond the basic teachings of the class, it is still a business class and every student is required to complete their own business venture. Depending on how much they develop the venture, Heine determines how much money they receive to act on their business plan.

"It's not a lot of money; I got about $120 that I'm going to use for my project at Yasumicon next year," said senior Teri Montgomery.

Yasumicon is the annual anime convention that the Anything Goes Anime FIU club hosts every year, which also incorporates various cultural Japanese aspects and of which Montgomery is the current president.

On Nov. 17, the class held a special seminar called "From East to West, And West to East" where several students got to showcase their own business ideas. There were roughly 70 people present at the seminar, but the number dwindled down to about 35 by the time the conference ended.

The projects showcased varied. Some of the business plans showcased included the creation of traditional tea shops to replace the coffee dominated market and martial arts instruction intended for adult practitioners.

Originally, each business plan was to be judged and a winner selected in a mock version of investment seeking. However, the judging aspect quickly turned into a positive critique and all eight students who presented were declared winners.

Essentially the seminar was an extended class, as many of the guest speakers went over specific aspects of the class that under normal circumstances were broadly covered. 

Overall, the class is primarily for business and Asian studies students.

The topics covered will seem extreme for someone raised in western culture, but Heine's students all seem to be learning a lot about Asian business.

"Its all about applying Asian values to business," said senior Lazaro Fraga. "I don't think the professor ever expected so many people to sign up for the class."

Headline: Students have hard time juggling class, jobs, sanity
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For many students like Andres Correra, taking classes and working during the week is a necessary burden, even though it can get "a little tough," as Correa puts it.  In Correa's case, it is exceptionally difficult, because he works several days a week.

"I work at Bonefish Grill in Kendall as a server four days a week," Correa said.  "The days that I don't work there, I referee high school soccer around Miami."

Working and taking classes  makes it more difficult to find time to study.

"Some days, I go straight from school to the restaurant, and I don't have time to study," Correa said.  On other days, "if I have a game to referee, I'll referee the game early, and I'll still have time [to study], because a game only lasts an hour and a half."

 Trying to get everything done isn't the only thing students need to worry about. With finals approaching and deadlines closing in, FIU's Health Services personnel warn against allowing school and work responsibilities to impair your health, physically and psychologically.

"A lot of times, things get neglected when you're spending so many hours at work and school," said Kathleen Kleinert, an advanced registered nurse practitioner and clinical coordinator of the Women's Clinic.

 "[Students] have to go to school, they have to go to work, so they cut out the other things that are equally important. Then you have your schoolwork that you have to do at home, and you cut corners."

The physical side effects to cutting corners, such as not eating or sleeping properly, or not taking the time to take care of one's self, can be significant.

"It can be a serious problem," Kleinert said. "Young people typically don't pay attention to their health as being significant until things get really bad. A lot of times, your body has to send you a message to slow down. Sometimes that involves making you sick or injured."

Physical manifestations of stress vary among people, ranging from headaches and back pains to gastrointestinal problems and insomnia.

"Whenever students come in with those complaints, we will ask them about their schedule," Kleinert said. "Many of our students are stretched thin, in particular at this school."

Kleinert formerly worked for the University of Miami, and noticed that UM students were not as stretched thin as FIU students.  While UM students generally had more financial resources than FIU's, "So many [FIU] students have to work to afford to go to school, and to support themselves, so they really do have to juggle," Kleinert said.

Besides the physical effects of stress and overwork, the psychological effects must also be considered.

"In terms of stress, to be working full-time and going to school requires a lot of time management," said Dr. Cheryl Nowell, director of Counseling and Psychological Services. "The recurring stressors of school are almost constant. You have the startup of the semester, you have midterms, and then you have finals. You have projects and papers due."

Psychological signs of stress are feelings of being overwhelmed instead of on top of things, Nowell said.  "It's clearly intertwined with the physical. The more stressed you are, the more tired you might be, for example."

Nowell observes that stress is not always a bad thing, which differentiates it from anxiety.

"Stress can be motivating and energizing," Nowell said.

Anxiety, on the other hand, has a negative physiological component, such as people not being able to sleep because they can't turn their thoughts off and feeling physically tense.  

"It's an extreme form of stress that causes interference," Nowell said. "You know you have something to do, but you're so anxious that you can't get it done."

Nowell stated that balance is the key to effectively prioritizing and managing time and responsibilities.

"You need to have personal time," Nowell said. "You need to have time devoted to working and time devoted to class, and time outside of class to study."

Additionally, both Kleinhert and Nowell also advocate exercise as a way of dealing with stress.

"Exercise helps you physically and mentally, it helps to discharge some of the tension, and also helps with relaxation," Nowell said.  

For many students, maintaining a sense of balance between work and school is not easy, and often requires sacrifice.

"It's hard, but I really need my degree," said senior Angela Council.

Council, in addition to being a part-time student, is an accountant for the Miami Heat who works five days a week, and is the mother of three girls.

In order to balance between work, school and taking care of her kids, Council has to practice time-management. When she has to choose between her job and her classes, Council chooses her classes.

"My job is already there, and I already know what to do at my job," she said.

Council said it took her a while to learn how to achieve a sense of balance. "It took me a long time for me to see that I lack in this area, and I need to focus more on it. Nothing happens overnight."

Headline: Recycling program improves
Author: Jose Pagliery / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While FIU already recycles an average of 35 tons of paper every month, along with thousands of crushed light bulbs and flattened cardboard, it may not be a strong enough recycling program when compared with other state universities.

One outspoken critic, Nasser Brahim, president of Students for Environmental Action, said the responsibility lies on the University.

"In Primera Casa, nine out of ten times [recycling bins] have been used incorrectly," Brahim said, pointing out that bad labeling often leads to incorrect recycling procedures. "[Students] want to recycle, but they don't know how to."

Unlike FIU, both the University of Miami and the University of Florida have websites and active programs that direct students to recycle as often as possible, supported by a recycling project that includes all kinds of material.

Changes have been implemented throughout the years at FIU with the addition of aluminum, glass and plastic disposal containers. Located on the first floors of the Health and Life Science, Chemistry and Physics and MARC buildings, along with all five floors of Primera Casa, these new recycling bins are an attempt at progress.

"We're trying to add at least another ten buildings in the next six months," said Joost "Joe" Nuninga, superintendent of Recycling and Waste at University Park.

However, Brahim claims that Nuninga told him the same thing - last year.

"Anything I can keep out of the trash, [I will]," Nuninga said in response.

Now in his fourth year as superintendent of RW, Nuninga has seen a number of administrative changes. Whereas FIU once only recycled white paper, it now recycles paper of all kinds. Also, since the practice of bulb recycling was implemented, tons of material has been recovered. Still, FIU could be months away from fully implementing a plastic, bottle, and glass recycling program, with campus groups such as SEA trying to speed up the change.

FIU's recycling system is very simple: the small blue bins that many students are familiar with are emptied into larger copy room bins which, in turn, are emptied into loading zones located by every building on campus. From there, they are transported to the Campus Services Complex recycling compound, where they are recovered by Simco, a large recycling company that pays FIU $20 per ton, all of which gets reinvested back into the program.

While it may not seem like much, recycling saves FIU a significant amount of money. With regular trash disposal now costing $65 per ton, Nuninga searches for ways to keep as much recyclable material out of the trash as possible.

In a county where only 19 percent of waste is recycled as the rest is left to landfills and combustion, SEA and Nuninga have quite a distance to go.

Brahim suggests that Coca-Cola should help FIU's recycling program because almost all canned and bottled drinks on campus are Coke products. Whether this is likely to happen or not is questionable, considering Coca-Cola's contract with FIU is up for review in December.

Headline: DOGS GONE WILD: Roaming dogs at UP cause concerns
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It was a typical night for Joel Silva. He had gotten off work  and was walking to his car parked by the Pharmed Arena when a pack of dogs appeared from the FIU Nature Preserve growling and barking at him. Fearing that they might attack, Silva quickly turned around and took an alternate route to his car.

 For the past several years, students and faculty have seen a pack of wild dogs roaming around University Park. Most see them patrolling the preserve by the arena, although others claim they've seen them by the UP Apartments.

 Nobody knows exactly how and when the dogs first made their way to the campus. Many people believe they are dogs that were left by owners who simply didn't want them anymore.

 Assistant Athletic Director Rich Kelch, who has been working at FIU for the past 28 years, said he first noticed the wild dogs four or five years ago. Kelch usually walks from his office in the arena to the FIU Stadium to watch the football team practice.

 "The other morning as I was going back into the gym, I heard a lot of barking and dogs crying and stuff but just kept moving. I wasn't going to stop and investigate but it sounded like some kind of doggy disturbance in the preserve."

He also said that dogs were living under the football trailer and even had puppies there.

Environmental Science and Chemistry professor Jack Parker, teaching at FIU since 1972, said he has seen the wild dogs for the past three years.

Parker said the departments of Risk Management and Environmental Health & Safety has done nothing during the last couple years to remove the dogs.

  Parker also said he heard that a faculty member's small dog was killed by the wild pack.

 "It's a major safety issue. At some point, some student will get attacked and the University will have to explain [itself]," Parker said.

Safety officials said they are working with Miami-Dade Animal Services and Critter Control to resolve the issue. In a week, they usually receive three to five complaints concerning the dogs.

"It is something we are working on constantly," said Bio Safety Officer Tamece Knowles. "We are trying to review all our options to capture the dogs."

The dogs must be contained before Animal Services can remove them from the campus, according to Knowles. Several University committees even proposed to put a fence around the preserve to capture the pack.

"We're trying to avoid somebody getting injured by the dogs," Knowles said.

Besides the fear of attack, others worry about the health risks the dogs may expose to them.

Carolina Matamoros, a freshman who works at the Recreation Center as a customer service attendant, has had students come up to her on several occasions and request that she call Public Safety about the dogs.

"They're not just pretty poodles, they're big dogs that have been in the wild for a while. They're dangerous, you don't know what they have," Matamoros said.

But why has the University been unable to keep the dogs away?

One of the reasons suggested is that someone has been feeding them.

Several weeks ago, there was a large pile of dog food on the grass between the Recreation Center and College of Law.  

Along with the food they have been receiving, Knowles said that many of the traps to capture the dogs have been set off by someone.

"It's hard to capture the dogs when somebody is sabotaging our efforts to capture them," Knowles said.

Not all students feel threatened by the dogs. Some students argue that the dogs are cute and don't mind sharing the campus with them.

Junior Matthew Christopher Mur has come to know the wild dogs during the past few months. Mur said that the dogs provide him comfort, especially after a bad day in class. 

"They seem pretty harmless. I'd rather share the campus with them than these demonic defecating ducks," Mur said. "Every where I walk, I manage to step on some duck s---; I have yet to step on any dog s---."

But students who are afraid of the dogs are also afraid of what may happen to them if they report them. 

"I hear people saying that they want to call animal control, but they don't want anything to happen to the dogs," said senior Alicia Brooks, who works as customer service attendant at the Recreation Center.

Miami-Dade County Animal Services advises students and faculty to stay away from the dogs.

Contact Public Safety at 305-348-2626  if you feel threatened by the dogs.

Headline: Review: Joanna Newsom - Ys (Music)
Author: Samantha Quiñon / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Joanna Newsom has a problem: she makes good music. This may not seem like a problem to you, but to a reviewer like me, it raises a very big question: is it better to compare Newsom's sophomore album Ys to her flawless debut album The Milk-Eyed Mender? Or should it be held to the same standards as every other piece of mall punk FYE has put out on its shelves this month?

Let's not be insulting. A folk harpist with an indie edge, Newsom's past efforts have stood on their own against the likes of Martha Wainwright, Devendra Banhart and Cat Power. Now, her new album Ys (pronounced "ease"), confirms she's still got it.

At five songs, ranging from seven to 17 minutes, it seems, at first glance, Newsom wanted to take her Appalachian melodies into operatic territory. The songs are long but charming narratives buoyed with Newsom's poetic imagery of "estuaries of white wax," "seashores unmapped" and the "bones of birches." As on The Milk-Eyed Mender, where Newsom sings of Cair Paravel and "peach, plum, pear," Ys maintains a whimsical quality; however, every song has a dark, yearning side that runs parallel.

"Monkey & Bear" tells of a monkey and a bear that are in love but cannot be together in a judgmental world. In "Darling there's a place for us," Newsom sings in her childish and earnest voice: "Can we go before I turn to dust? Darling there's a place for us."

On the fourth track, "Only Skin," a woman plaintively sings to her lover about the history of their relationship and his infidelity, concluding, "And if the love a woman or two, dear, could move you to such heights, then all I can do, is do, my darling, right by you."

Newsom's voice is at the forefront of the song, and her harp has been mixed well alongside string arrangements. The same can be said for its predecessor, "Sawdust & Diamonds." The beauty of these two songs makes the overproduction on the other songs all the more apparent and unfortunate.

Ys's harp and the vocals were recorded in one studio and the orchestral arrangements recorded in another. The recordings were then mixed and mastered on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Somewhere between all this slicing and dicing and recording, Newsom's voice and harp get lost. The opening track, "Emily," sounds as though she accidentally left her radio on a classical music station with the volume set entirely too loud. The beauty of Newsom's music is its simplicity, and the orchestra is a distraction. 

Despite this, Ys is a positive new direction for Newsom. If she would only fire Van Dyke Parks and get a better producer to complement Steve Albini's recording skills, her next album could be perfect.

Headline: Review: Casino Royale (Movie)
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Casino Royale is not a typical James Bond film: it's a much edgier film that reveals Bond as a more vulnerable and dangerous character than in previous films. The usual Bond characters Moneypenny and Q are missing and so are the gadgets and stale one-liners. And of course, you have Daniel Craig replacing Pierce Brosnan, who changes everything we know about James Bond.

Because this film is meant to reboot the franchise, the story centers around one of Bond's earliest missions. Bond is sent out to trace a bomb network that leads to Le Chiffre, a terrorist weapons financer played by Mads Mikkelsen, who loses more than $100 million after Bond thwarts a terrorist scheme. Bond's mission then is to defeat Le Chiffre at a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale in Montenegro, which Le Chiffre has set up to win his money back. Accompanying Bond on his mission is Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). Craig and Green share a chemistry that has been lacking in many past Bond films. However, this movie is all Daniel Craig.  

As Bond, Craig, a relative unknown who starred in Munich and Layer Cake, brings back the sinister element of the character that Connery had but the others lacked, while still remaining fun to watch. Craig plays Bond as a vicious thug who doesn't care about sophistication. Bond hasn't streamlined himself into the character we all know him as ­- he acts on his impulses. Craig is not the invincible Bond who winks at the screen delivering puns. He prefers a no-nonsense attitude to get the job done. This is the new face of Bond and probably the best since Connery. He has potential to even top Connery. 

Unlike some of the latest Bond movies, his fights aren't run by invisible cars and underwater jets. They're physical endeavors and you can actually believe that this 007 can pull off the action sequences. A chase sequence through an African construction site contains some elaborate footwork and brutality between Bond and his adversary.

Another chase sequence at the Miami International Airport is also a standout. However, Royale's best sequences are the poker scenes that are tense as Le Chiffre and Bond use their brains to beat each other. Credit director Martin Campbell and writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Oscar winner Paul Haggis for bringing the life back into the franchise.

By the climax, Bond comes out smarter, tougher and less arrogant. We see shades of the old character we know but realize that with this new Bond, the series sets off into a new direction. This is one of the series' finest films.

Headline: Review: .hack//G.U. Vol.1//Rebirth (Game)
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
.hack// has become one of the most expansive series ever brought to the U.S. from Japan. The series segues from Japanese animation series to video games, besides other media. The latest edition to the .hack// series is .hack//G.U. Vol.1//Rebirth for the PlayStation 2. 

The game is a huge step up from the previous .hack// games for the PS2. For longtime fans, the first thing they'll notice while playing Rebirth is the game's length. Rebirth will take players roughly 25 hours to complete. 

Besides lengthy playing time, the new graphics are stunning. The game utilizes the cel shading animation method used in cartoonish games. Rebirth, however, is anything but cartoonish. And combined with a new story, players will easily forget they are playing a game.

Rebirth's story is about an online gamer named Haseo searching for a player with the alias "Tri-Edge," who is responsible for putting his friend into a coma while playing the online game called The World.

The plot is very involved, and the best part is you don't have to know anything about the series to enjoy it. 

The game is also loaded with tons of little details that will give longtime fans reason to pass out, especially the true identity of an enemy you encounter throughout the game.

If you want to know more about the back-story, buy the special edition of the game, which comes with a bonus disk and a collectable action figure. 

Like previous games, Rebirth is a simulated online game, meaning it plays as if you were online without actually being online. This time around, though, it's handled much better. For example, there are message boards that you must check for information to continue the game.  In Rebirth, you can actually reply to several message threads, and depending on your answer, receive some kind of valuable information or not.

 Game play also got a major overhaul. In the first four games, the battle system was horribly average. New abilities like "Rengeki" (a special attack to use on enemies that have received enough damage) add a whole new level to this game, though.

 .hack//G.U. Vol.1//Rebirth is definitely worth your time and effort. Long time fans are going to get the most out of it, but any gamer should enjoy the captivating story, extensive game play options and rich graphics.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit: Extended holiday season unnecessary
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's the most wonderful time of the year! Or so that's what everything from the television to the shopping malls and billboards want you to think.

The holiday season is upon us. It's time to remove all those Halloween and Thanksgiving decorations and put up the Christmas trees, begin singing carols, and of course, start shopping a whole month in advance for gifts.

I love Christmas. It's my favorite holiday of the year. I love almost every aspect of it - the decorations, the Christmas trees, the family gatherings, watching A Christmas Story on television and the weather, even if it's not that cold down here in Florida.

I begin every year looking forward to Christmas but for all the wonderful things that go with this holiday, there's the underbelly of manipulation and greed that goes hand-in-hand.

Christmas season is supposed to start during the first week of December, not the day after Halloween. However, like Halloween, we find it ever so convenient to elongate the season every year. Yes, it's great to get into the spirit of Christmas, but not two whole months in advance.

Christmas themed movies like The Santa Clause 3 and Happy Feet are already out making the big box office buckaroos. Cingular commercials on TV are parodying A Christmas Story to advertise their new seasonal offer. Flight prices are already through the roof. The most important day in Christianity has evolved into a commercial consuming machine.

We are told it's the season of giving and receiving but the people who really benefit from that are those behind the chiming bells of the cash registers. This year's going to be no different. I'm already dreading visiting the malls for the next few weeks.

I love movies and I usually go to malls for that purpose, but I can already picture the gargantuan lines of parents and kids fighting over toys like in the ridiculous Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Jingle All The Way.

This season's top selling gifts are going to be no-brainers: The mammoth Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii are overly hyped video game consoles that people are literally dying for. A woman was actually shot and killed while exiting a store with a new PlayStation. 'Tis the season to be jolly, indeed. 

Not to be left out in the cold, Hollywood is dishing out some of its biggest DVDs in the next few weeks to cash in on the holiday hysteria.

Studios are all set to release ultra special mega unrated director's cuts of half of the movies from their archives, especially when they're hardly ultra, special or mega.

On the musical front, big holiday releases from rappers Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Nas, as well as pop and rock acts like Gwen Stefani and Incubus, are expected to sell in large numbers along with greatest hits and compilations created specifically to cash in on the holidays

In the midst of all the madness, we forget the spirit of Christmas.

We don't need to buy the biggest, most outrageous gifts for people just to prove you're a good parent or sibling.

Buy a gift that actually means something.

Diamonds, gold, PlayStations, iPods and Gucci jackets don't count. Go out of your way and do something nice.

Headline: FLYING HIGH: Photographer's job taken to new heights
Author: Chris Cutro / Photo Editor
&nbsp;
There are few times in life when I've been so scared and so excited at the same time. Sitting next to the opened doors of an Army jump plane, trying to get a picture of the seven men who'd soon be jumping out of the aircraft, I was doing something I would never have experienced if I had stuck with my original major, computer science.

But now, as a photojournalist working for The Beacon, the chance presented itself and I had to take it.

In true form of random events, the day before the FIU homecoming game, we received a call at the newspaper from the Reserve Officers' Training Corps informing us that there was one spot available on an airplane for a photographer to ride with the Army's Golden Knights Black Demonstration Team. The parachuting team was supposed to deliver the football for the game.

At 4 p.m. the day after receiving the call, I found myself sitting on the Golden Knights aircraft signing my life away and being briefed by Sergeant Jon Ewald on where to sit and where not to throw up.

The team packed its parachutes and rigged the game ball to a belt for safekeeping. After the jump team went through their brief pre-jump routine, my camera and I were quickly strapped in a seat next to the door of the aircraft, and we started to taxi to the runway.

As soon as we got to the runway, I heard the engines gaining power as we started to accelerate. Before I could hold my breath, we were airborne.  

The ground quickly disappeared as we flew higher, the view got better, and the air got colder. In a normal airplane, the doors are closed during the flight. This aircraft was more like a three-hour roller coaster with no safety handles and no end in sight.

We quickly reached an altitude of 3,500 ft., and considering that I am a shorts and t-shirt kind of guy, it was freezing.

The turns were sharp and suddenly I was grabbing for something to hold on to.

Once the plane leveled out, the jumpers were up and about preparing. The first task was to drop streamers to locate their proper positions on the football field.

After a few more sharp turns, we had our bearings and everything was set to go.  During this time, everyone was up joking around ­- mostly about my attempt to hold on for dear life.

It seemed as though these guys were pretty non-chalant considering they were about to willingly throw themselves out of an airplane.

The Black Demonstration Team leader, Sergeant First Class Paul Sachs, informed me that we had 30 minutes to go before it was time for the jump.

So much for my enjoyment - we circled FIU over and over again; the setting sun made the scenery was beautiful, but the cold weather started to become even colder.

Finally, it was time: a green light went on in the cabin and a buzzer went off indicating one minute until the jump.  

I shook some hands and thanked them for having me along for the ride. The team leader crossed his arms, the 30-second signal.

After a very brief thumbs up, in a blink of an eye, all seven of them were out the door, headed toward the ground and FIU. I, on the other hand, was headed back to Fort Lauderdale International Airport.

The ride back was quiet and cold but as the plane touched down I thanked God that I was back on the ground.

As I got in my car and felt my extremities return to their proper temperature, I contemplated how irreplaceable my experience was.

If everything goes according to plans, I'll be continuing my education for one more semester so I can go out into the world and find more of these terrifying, thrilling adventures.

Headline: Banquet discusses global hunger
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With Thanksgiving just last week, the International Student and Scholar Services held a different type of feast.

The Hunger Banquet was held in the Lakeview North Recreational Lounge at University Park on Nov. 17 and provided students with food for thought, not their stomachs.

The interactive experience demonstrated the impact of global hunger through activities and discussion.

The event was the end result of International Education Week that ran from Nov. 13 through Nov. 17 and provided events promoting global understanding at both the Biscayne Bay Campus and UP.

Coordinator Jennifer Camacho of the ISSS first took part in the Hunger Banquet three years ago while participating in Alternative Spring Break.

 "It blew my mind and affected me," Camacho said.

Oxfam International, a development and relief agency fighting poverty, hunger and injustice first devised the banquet allowing participants to comprehend global hunger through in-depth activities.

Student Government Association co-sponsored the banquet for the educational experience it would bring to students. 

 "This was a chance for students to really understand the suffering and strife that people face because they are hungry," said Joandra Ramdass, international student committee chair for SGA.  

"Anything that raises awareness and helps a person to empathize is a worthwhile cause and that was the potential I saw in this event."

Upon entrance, each person was given a ticket with a one, two or three on it.

Each number corresponded to an economic situation for the evening.

The threes sat on the floor and were fed bread and water.

The ones sat at a table and given a full meal. 

The rest represented the middle class and received rice and vegetables.

 "The main purpose is to show students the realities of global hunger," Camacho said. "It happens everywhere, even in your own backyard.  We want to bring it home and have a local perspective."

Throughout the activity, students were given scenarios to show how easy it is for individuals to move up and down social classes. 

Some in the two group succumbed to hypothetical economic changes when they dropped to threes. 

"A lot of people live paycheck to paycheck.  Our current economic environment is very unstable," Camacho said.

"We want to demonstrate how easy it is to move from one level to another."

Every day, more than 16,000 children die from hunger-related causes - one child every five seconds, according to hunger statistics provided by bread.org, a world hunger website.

Providence Okoye, vice president of Student Government Council at UP, began her night part of the middle class. Soon enough, though, she too joined the lower ranks.

After being fed some rice and vegetables, Okoye fell to the lower class where her food was replaced with bread and water.

Okoye sees the problem in some ways as an issue of habit and in other ways an issue of distance.

"People get comfortable where they are," Okoye said.

"It's a world away to them and not their problem."

Headline: Swami a guest at peace conference
Author: Nicole Acosta And Francesca Constantins / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Unity. Harmony. Peace. This is what a panel representing the entire spectrum of major religions will promote as they put their religious differences aside and come together for the World Peace Conference to "create a unified vision for world peace," according to their theme.

Taking place Nov. 30 at 6 p.m. at the Biscayne Bay Campus Kovens Conference Center, the World Peace Conference will bring together a range of religions, varying from Catholic and Protestant Christianity to Hinduism and Buddhism.

The goal of the conference is to spread awareness about how to establish peace in life and how to take that peace and spread it throughout the family, community and the world.

 The event is being sponsored by FIU's Center for the Study of Spirituality and the Kriya Yoga Institute in Homestead.  

The theme of the conference is "Peace is our Birthright: Creating a Unified Vision for World Peace."

The conference is in memory of His Holiness Paramahamsa Hariharananda, the spiritual leader of the Kriya Yoga Institute, whose centenary is being celebrated this year.

Among the panelists speaking at the conference is Paramahamsa Prajñanananda, a Hindu who met his master, Hariharananda, while he was a college student looking for a spiritual guide.

Prajñanananda was initiated into the path of Kriya Yoga by Hariharananda and later initiated into the path of monkhood. He became Swami Prajñanananda Giri.

In 1998, he was bestowed the title of Paramahamsa, the highest attainable title for monks.

Prajñanananda is an author who has compiled, translated and edited many religious books, including the Bible and Discourses on the Bhagavad-Gita Parts 1 and 2.

The Beacon spoke with the swami about his views on peace, yoga and his message.

Q: What is the purpose of the panel on Nov. 30?

A: It is to talk about the 100 teachings of Paramahamsa Hariharanda, and bring people from different religions to come together in the Northeast to bring peace in the world.

Q: How did his teaching help lead you to what is Kriya Yoga today?

A: It is a meditation technique practice that helps better the mind, and that exercises the mind to be silent, or more focused  and concentrated.

Q: What message are you trying to send to people through Kriya Yoga?

A: Breathing is essential to a person's life; when a person is angry or in danger, he or she breathes fast. Sleeping slows down the breath, and it could lead to a better life. 

Q: How does this help the spirit and soul?

A: Breath affects life and the ability to live. It is like when a soul leaves the body, it ends up lifeless and the body ends up lifeless without breath.  

Q: How does it balance by bringing love, peace, and harmony to life?

A: Love, peace and harmony bring a balanced practice system to get good health. For example, if a person eats too much or too less it ends up not being good for their health. The body can't work with too much; it gets tired and can intervene with work and relationship.

Q: How can this bring about world peace?

A: It all starts with the family members. Each member has to be in peace with their family and that leads and contributes to peace in society and then peace to the world.
