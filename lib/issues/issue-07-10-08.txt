The three-council meeting (between Panther Power, Student Programming Association, Student Government Association, and Housing Council) has been postponed. 

No date has been set for future meeting. 

Vice president Andrade was in Tallahassee last week along with University Park representatives making recommendations to make sure the medical school is not taken away or any funding is removed from that program. 

However, these appeals are only house and 
senate recommendations; they are still subject to a veto by the governor. So far the Senate has requested a 2.9% budget cut in most medical schools in Florida. 

There will be more updates as the situation progresses. 

Oct. 17: tentative date for a final update on what the governor has finally decided to do. 

Andrade spoke to Anthony Rionda, lectures coordinator at University Park. They have lectures program ready.

UP lectures: 

Tentative: Rachel Smith, current Miss USA, to come on Oct. 11 to University Park. 

Jan. 30, Spencer Wells, a geneticist and anthropologist, will lecture at University Park. 

Feb. 19, Jeff Corwin, a TV personality who works with animals, will visit University Park. 

Biscayne Bay still working to secure speakers for lectures. A future prospect is Robert Kennedy Jr., son of Robert F. Kennedy. 

Next lectures committee meeting is on October 9 at 9:15 a.m. Venue was not mentioned. Students are invited to come and express their opinion. 

This week, Judene Tulloch (representative at large), Fabrice Octave (Student Services Chair), Leslie Valentin (Hospitality Representative) and Vice-President Cassandra will be going to Gainesville for the Florida Student Association meeting. They will meet and discuss issues like campus growth and construction, yearly budgets and tuition costs with similar members from other universities. 



SGA Advisor's Report (Craig Cunningham):
Reminder of first ever SGA interns retreat from Oct. 19 to 21. 

On Oct. 9, Campus Ministry will sponsor "All Roads Lead to Jerusalem and also Rome" event at Biscayne Bay campus. Rabbi Mario Rojzman and Bishop Justo Laguna from Argentina will come and talk about trips to Rome and Israel they made and the book they wrote together. 

Once the new fitness center opens next week (Oct. 12), it must be determined what will be done with the space from the former fitness center. Campus Life will get half of that space. Discussion on space allocation is ongoing.

Thursday Oct. 11: Aramark corporation will be holding an information session on WUC 155 at 12:30 p.m. At the session, representatives from their corporate office will discuss positions within Aramark and how students can be hired in the future. Also, they will discuss how students could be potentially hired to work on their behalf in the Olympics next summer. 


Special Events Director's Report (Angela Thomas):
Volunteers are needed for the new fitness center's grand opening (Oct. 12), the Fall open house (Oct. 13) and Diversity Day at FIU (Oct. 18). 

For the latter, Thomas is working with Diane Newman, faculty advisor and coordinator for the event, to have a parade featuring costumes from different countries. 



Internship Director's Report (Ana Maria Silva):
Reminder of future SGA intern retreat from Oct. 19to 21. Two sessions for retreat orientation will be held, one on Oct. 8 at 1:00 p.m. and the other on Oct. 10, 3:00 p.m.

Comm. Relations and Environmental Affairs Director's Report (David Fonseca):
Students have complained that doors at the marine biology building have defects, letting air seep out. 

It has been happening for a year and a half. SGA has hired a company to do maintenance. Fonseca expressed thanks to finance representatives for approving $350 for event organized by Jayne Klein, BBC Coordinator and Honors College advisor, in Overtown.

He is not satisfied with bathrooms renovation at Wolfe University Center. Fonseca was told by Cunningham that they would be "environmentally sound" or friendly but it did not appear so in the budget to rebuild them. 

SGA should look into these problems in the future, as it must be reported whenever a budget goes over or under even if it is one penny. 

President Saintable responded to last item saying that plans for construction were approved two years ago and such concerns had not surfaced. In the future, SGA will 
be more conscious about this issue.

Headline: New fitness center to enhance workouts
Author: Patricia Gonzalez /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Senior Kenid Joseph will be one of many students who will have a chance to utilize the Biscayne Bay Campus's new state-of-the-art fitness center, scheduled to open on Oct. 12.

For the past year, Joseph had been working out at BBC's former fitness center, located on the third floor of the Wolfe University Center. 

She agreed BBC needed an upgraded fitness facility. 

"The old gym felt cramped. There was such a small amount of equipment that I had to wait in line for people to finish using the machines," Joseph said.

The fitness center's open house and ribbon-cutting ceremony will be on Oct. 12 at 10 a.m. 

Tours of the new facility, located at WUC 160, will be given, as well as demonstrations of the machines by representatives of equipment vendors such as Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, and Hampton Strength Systems. 

Students will have the opportunity to collect giveaways and prizes, such as towels and water bottles. 

Faculty and staff will get the chance to win a membership through a raffle. 

The new fitness center will have more than double the number of equipment than the former fitness center. For example, 21 cardiovascular machines are expected to be in the cardio village section; the former center only had four.

Nine plasma screen televisions will be installed in the new fitness center. 

The center also will include a 1,100 square foot aerobics studio offering many classes such as hip-hop, kickboxing, ballroom dancing, and belly dancing. 

Whereas the former fitness center hosted the aerobics classes in the same room where students used the exercise equipment, the new center has a designated aerobics room. The room also will be utilized for conducting yoga classes in collaboration with The Wellness Center.  

In addition to offering courses on meditation and stress management, complementary massages will be offered. 

Also provided  are women's and men's locker rooms complete with restrooms and showers.

"This fitness center is going to offer a lot more options for students. The objective is to help all students feel like there is something there that they can benefit from, in terms of the equipment, the classes that are offered, and the convenience of the facility. 

"We really think that students will find it a place that they can enjoy going to, and working out in," Cathy Akens, assistant vice president for Student Affairs, said.

The reason for building the new 12,000 square foot facility was to meet the needs of the students, according to Elias Bardawil, associate director of campus recreation.  

"The new fitness center is much more female friendly. There is more equipment [ideal] for the deconditioned athlete. 

"The equipment in the current fitness center is plate-loaded which makes it more difficult for someone who is not used to working out," Bardawil said.

Students with less experience working out will have the opportunity to schedule appointments with on-staff trainers. 

In addition to helping students become better associated with the equipment, trainers will also make sure their work out regimen reaches its full potential.      

Construction on the new fitness center began in spring 2006. Stobbs Brothers Construction is the company that built the $1.8 million facility. 

The money to build the new fitness center was provided by Capital Improvement Trust Funds so this project did not affect student tuition.

The new fitness center will have a passage that leads to the now closed Aquatic Center. 

Although no date has been set for the reopening of the Aquatic Center, it is anticipated to be a very important asset to the fitness center.

Together, the Fitness and Aquatic Centers will form a combined 70,000 square foot mega recreational complex, Bardawil said.

"The Aquatic Center is going to provide an optimal balance of recreational programs, academic classes, and varsity athletics," Bardawil said, in reference to swimming, lifeguard and scuba diving classes that will be offered at the Aquatic Center in the future. 

James Wassenaar, executive director of student affairs operations and auxiliary services, feels that the new facility will improve the quality of life for students living on campus. 

"The fitness center is an important amenity for resident students. They spend 24 hours a day, and seven days week on campus. 

"I hope that it is seen as another wonderful facility for students to utilize," Wassenaar said.

Headline: Religious club caters to Witnesses
Author: Catherine Kaiman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When a traveling Jehovah's Witnesses club overseer suggested to Anthony Muthra, a construction management major, to start a club chapter at FIU in December 2006, Muthra thought it was a great idea.

A month later, the Jehovah's Witnesses club was formed at the Biscayne Bay Campus and it currently has 10 members.

"I really enjoy being a part of this organization because we help clear up misconceptions about what [Jehovah's] Witnesses are, how we organize and what we believe in," said Muthra, the club's vice president.

The club wanted to share their beliefs with each other and the rest of the student body, according to Voltaire Lysius, an FIU alum and the club's advisor.

"The club is a way for students who are Jehovah's Witnesses to express their concern for their fellow students and educators by providing Bible -based literature that encourages moral values and answers some of life's most serious questions," Lysius said.

The Jehovah's Witnesses religion was founded in 1870. It interprets the Bible to be God's word and is historically accurate. People practicing the religion believe that Jesus Christ was God's son and try to live in accordance with Jesus' life. The religion currently has 7 million members across the world.

The club's mission statement, written by Lysius, is "Moral instruction and education are inseparable. This was the conclusion of [Russian author and philosopher] Leo Tolstoy's lifetime of reflection and experience. The purpose of the student organization is to distribute literature that helps one to appreciate that there needs to be the [teaching] of moral values if education is to be beneficial."

Club members provide any student who is interested in becoming a Jehovah's Witness with home Bible studies, free of charge. These individual lessons teach the religion's interpretations and analyze particular passages of the Bible.

The club recruits members through tabling, which is set up in the Wolfe University Center at various times during the week. Students can pick up information on the religion and the club as well as talk to club members.

The club meets once a month at BBC at varied times and locations. When it is difficult to organize the group, meetings are conducted over the phone to discuss club issues. To ensure that everyone has a chance to read the material, accommodations are made for the visually or hearing impaired.

"I enjoy the meetings because everyone is friendly and I love that we take the time to study the Bible and discuss it as a group, rather than everyone having their own analysis," said Wade Charlestant, a senior majoring in education and a club member. 

The club is still a work in progress, Muthra said. He and the club members hope to schedule events for students to watch videos on the religion's beliefs and history.

Although the clubs has not set any events yet, Muthra said that students would be made aware when there are special guest speakers and lecturers, such as prominent Jehovah's Witnesses, in any of the South Florida congregations.

The club does not have its own Web site, but anyone interested in learning more about the religion should visit The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society's Web site, www.watchtower.org, according to Lysius. All Jehovah's Witnesses congregations fall under the Watchtower Society, an organization that distributes all literature and books to its followers.

For information, e-mail Muthra at modena09@gmail.com.

Headline: Professor uses  life experiences for work, plays
Author: Glenn Coine / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Professor Mario Diament of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication said the most significant aspects of his career has been his experience with investigative reporting, theater writing, and growing up under a military dictatorship in Argentina.

"I think that after doing all the things [I have done] and the things I still expect to do and having lived through times of turmoil and despair and times of hope and happiness I have gained a certain insight into the nature of people," Diament said. Born in Argentina in 1942, Diament cultivated a love for journalism because his father would read stories to him in the local paper.

"[The stories were] mostly about exotic countries, interesting places…" Diament said. "[Writing and journalism] seemed like something I'd really like to do, to have the opportunity to see interesting things, and to fight for causes I believe in."

Diament went on to work as a journalist in Argentina during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Working under a military dictatorship there, he and other journalists were subject to various degrees of censorship and violence.

At the time, Diament said that reporters in Argentina had to be careful with what they wrote because not only was the government watching the press, but a lot of reporters were killed by the military. Diament said this did not stop him from covering what he thought needed to be covered.

"[I wrote] to denounce morally wrong and illegal acts of the government, and to fight for freedom and justice, and to defend those who I thought should be defended," Diament said.

Argentina was not the only place where Diament faced censorship. As a foreign correspondent, he was once jailed in Yugoslavia in the 1970s when he was assigned to cover a story on Josip Broz Tito. Tito was the president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1953 to 1980.

"These experiences give you a better understanding of the importance of your profession [as a journalist]. It is your responsibility to tell people what's happening," Diament said.

In addition to his journalistic experience, Diament has written nine plays as well as a screenplay. Blind Date, a play Diament wrote in 2004, is one he considers his favorite. It is about a chance encounter amongst five people in various situations and coincidentally meet. Diament wrote Blind Date in order to show that daily events can change a person's life without the people involved being aware of it.

"This was a difficult play, because there was minimal action. Normally, in theatre, things are about action, but in Blind Date, the characters tell the stories to the audience, so the language is very important to keep the audience's attention," Diament said.

Blind Date is now in the process of being made into a film, which is being co-produced in Argentina and Spain, and will be released in 2008.

Diament went on to enroll into the master's program at Antioch University in Yellow Springs, Ohio. The University offered Diament the option of allowing him to enter directly into their masters' program based on his career experience, even though he did not have a bachelor of arts degree. Diament graduated from the program in 1995.

Diament was asked by FIU staff to do research on the state of the Spanish language press in the U.S. He was asked to stay in order to develop SJMC's Spanish Language masters program. 

Students such as Luis Acosta know that Diament understands the importance of storytelling. Acosta recalls his first assignment for Diament's "Thinking Like a Writer" class, taught in Spanish.

"He wanted us to talk about our mothers as if they were characters, and events were episodes.

"This one girl mentioned [in her paper] something about her mother liking orchids and [Diament] took that and showed her how to do her whole story based on that one little thing about her mom liking flowers. And he did that with everyone's [story]. He would get an idea from the most insignificant detail and direct us from there," said Acosta, a graduate student.

Allan Richards, SJMC chair, said he has sat in on Diament's classes and believes that Diament has the ability to guide his students into becoming better writers and journalists.

"Not only is he charming, but he knows how to zero in on what a student is doing or not doing in a story," Richards said.

Diament said he likes to give his students tools and tips to help them become better journalists.

"You can't enter into [journalism] if you don't have curiosity and passion for the truth. Without those things, you'll never be a good writer or journalist," Diament said.

Headline: Rumor Has It: Television, Web sites aim to disprove urban legends
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Kidney thieves, alligators in sewers, evil spirits responding to chants of  "Bloody Mary" - the term "urban legend" refers to a widely-circulating story that is usually untrue, or at least impossible to prove. Often, they begin with some small element of truth, but become increasingly exaggerated as they get passed through the grapevine. 

Some are merely amusing, and could be fun to pass on to others even if one did not truly believe them. Others appeal to their audience because of shock value, mystery and horror. 

Freshman Henry Labrada thinks that urban legends appeal to the public's curiosity and sense of adventure.

"I think urban legends are so popular because people love being scared," Labrada said. "They enjoy putting themselves in other people's shoes and getting that adrenaline."

The use of E-mail and the Internet has made it much easier to circulate information quickly and globally, allowing urban legends to snowball and spread. The Internet, however, has also served to debunk a lot of these misconceptions, making web sites that expose fact and fiction almost as popular as the myths themselves. 

One such web site is www.snopes.com, named after a family of characters in the works of American author William Faulkner. Here, visitors can browse through dozens of categories of urban legends, hoaxes and general misconceptions for crimes, politics and radio and television. 

Operated by Barbara and David Mikkelson, the web site rates hundreds of stories with green, yellow, red or white dots that measure validity. Green is used to rate ideas that have either been proven by evidence or that were once based on real events while yellow refers to claims with insufficient evidence. Red is used for stories determined too improbable, stories that would have been all over the news if they had actually occurred. 

Freshman Katherine Benzaquen believes that, in spite of the evidence snopes.com collects, the site's decisions should be questioned.

"I have heard of snopes.com and I think it's pretty interesting, but I wouldn't trust everything it says," Benzaquen said. 

The Mikkelsons are quick to point out that, although they have bibliographies to support their verdicts, no one should take them as the final authority. 

Another popular medium for testing and debunking urban myths is the show "MythBusters," appearing on the Discovery Channel. 

In each episode, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman choose three common beliefs or themes. According to Discovery.com, instead of merely looking for information that would disprove the myths, Savage and Hyneman set out to personally test them, no matter how dangerous doing so can become. 

Past episodes have been centered on ninjas, the reliability of air bags and the idea that fire can be extinguished using nothing more than the human voice.

Sarah Nelson, a junior, said the show has been well-liked because it piques viewers' curiosity, and simultaneously offers useful information.

"I think it's pretty entertaining, and they have good facts," Nelson said. "The last one I saw was one with Coke, whether it can clean the [car] engine better than water. It worked about the same as water."

Nelson also points to a deeper reason for our fascination with shows that test our assumptions.

"Our society and culture is so based on tradition and these urban legends that we want to know if our basis is true or not," Nelson said. "We rely so much on media, and 'MythBusters' focuses on whether these movies are right or not. It's interesting to see whether the scriptwriters have done their homework."

Ultimately, urban legends might reflect society's love for mysterious, seemingly-impossible stories, but it remains debatable whether the veracity of each individual myth actually matters all that much. 

Labrada questions whether the way snopes.com and "Mythbusters" collects evidence to prove or disprove these stories, and then makes all such evidence available to the public.

"I think most of the urban legends can be proven false," Labrada said. "But who would take the time to do it?"

Headline: The Meaning of Life...a column looking for the answers: Son plans trip to find lost father
Author: C. Joel Marino / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Dan Levinson is planning a trip.

It's going to be a long trip, so he's been preparing for it all summer, even teaching himself a foreign language during the hour-long commutes to his current school, St. John's University in New York.

Dan, 22 years old and originally from Broward, is a good student and an ambitious guy. 

He graduated from William & Mary's in 2006 and is pursuing a degree in international law. 

But there are days when Dan can't help feeling bored in class. 

If he doesn't zone out, he turns on a computer and searches for news articles with two key words: 'Bob' and 'Levinson.' That's his dad's name; that's also the reason for his trip.

Bob Levinson went missing somewhere in the Middle East seven months ago.

Dan said his dad - a former FBI agent turned private investigator - was subcontracted by some major corporations to investigate cigarette smuggling in Iran.

Bob, 59, left Dubai at 10:45 a.m. on March 8 and arrived at Kish Island, Iran, that same day. He checked into a hotel that afternoon. He hasn't been heard from since.

"I was in Japan when my mom sent me an E-mail and asked me to call home. That's when she told me my dad went missing," Dan said. "I was the last to know."

The Levinsons are a large family: the parents, Christine and Bob, plus seven children; Dan is the middle child.

"People call us the Brady Bunch because we're so close. We're just a traditional family, I guess," Dan said.

A Facebook group dedicated to the family shows the siblings huddled in front of the camera, all hugs and smiles.

Dan and his siblings share what he calls a typical Levinson trait: optimism, which he attributes to their tight bond. 

They bristle when anyone asks what kind of man Bob was - he's still alive, they say, so they refuse to answer in the past tense.

The Iranian government has said there's no evidence Bob is in the country, though reports given to the Swiss embassy in Tehran say that he did arrive in Kish and took a taxi from his hotel. 

These are the family's only leads.

But this doesn't deter the Levinson optimism. Dan is traveling to Iran to look for his dad.

Comments left on Internet message boards have called it a stupid decision and a suicide mission. 

The messages disturb Dan, but he says the trip is something he has to do. He hopes to leave by the end of the year and scour the vast country for leads on Bob's fate with his mom and other family members.

This wasn't their first idea.

"Please help my family locate my father … Please do all that you can to bring him home to us," wrote Stephanie Curry, a Levinson sister, in one of many letters sent by family and friends to Mohammad Khazaee, Iranian ambassador to the United Nations.

National and global media have covered their story. The Levinsons even tried to ask Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad if he had any updates on Bob's search when he recently spoke at Columbia University.

These options haven't gotten them far. The trip isn't their last resort, just their best, Dan likes to say.

"We go to church every week and pray that he's well, because we know he's well," Dan said. "He's still out there, somewhere."

Dan visits bars, spends time with his friends and girlfriend, and makes sure to stay on top of his homework.

Besides Japan, he's also traveled to Europe and China and hopes to one day visit South America. 

But for now, his mind is stuck on the thoughts of another trip, and of his dad and family.

"Sometimes I feel guilty living my own life. It's like we're all just distracting ourselves until dad comes home," he said.

Headline: Review: Bruce Springsteen - Magic (Music)
Subheadline: Album shows rock can still deliver a profound message
Author: Ever Cruz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With Magic, Bruce Springsteen's first album in five years with the E Street Band, he has created one of the most honest and important records in the last few years. 

The album opens with the thunderous, riff-heavy, "Radio Nowhere," in which Springsteen bluntly takes aim at the current and sad state of music invading the airwaves. In the chorus, he growls, 'This is radio nowhere/is there anybody alive out there?'

Magic is more aggressive than his previous release, the Sept. 11 mournful The Rising. On "Living In The Future," Springsteen sings about the dark times ahead; he addresses issues such as lovers being separated by war as well as the global warming issue. 

Interestingly enough, the track is as upbeat as one of the band's 80's tracks, driven by an infectious saxophone and pounding drums. He's worried about the future but nonetheless, he still has hope that things can turn around for the better.

"Gypsy Biker" is a sad track about a family member lost at war and the effects it has on family. Then, In "I'll Work For Your Love," Springsteen sings about trying hard to become a citizen for God. 

The title track beautifully employs acoustic guitar, mandolin and a synth keyboard for a song that mixes lyrics about illusion and death. 

The violin, driving drums and desperate-sounding vocals scream for attention as Springsteen sings, 'Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break ... Who'll be the last to die, for a mistake.'

For those familiar with Springsteen's work, the album is a combination of 70s Springsteen, in the style of Born To Run and Born In The USA. Just like those classic albums, this release uses the "wall-of-sound" approach, in which layers of instruments are used in songs; instruments that range from traditional rock 'n' roll instruments to organs and string arrangements. 

Another Springsteen trademark apparent on the album is that he writes songs as if they were stories, similar to mini-novels. Magic is full of stories about American life - life in the 21st century. 

The themes on this album range from the war in Iraq, to decisions the government makes and how it affects the people. 

Ultimately, this is a solid album that speaks about the harsh realities of today - songs that are relevant for today's generation. For those who still believe in rock 'n' roll and think about what's going on in the world, this album is for you.

Headline: University faces NCAA violations for competing with ineligible athletes
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The NCAA sent a "notice of allegations" to University President Modest A. Maidique Oct. 1 detailing that the institution violated several bylaws allowing 40 ineligible student-athletes to compete during the 2002-03 through 2006-07 academic years.

The NCAA reported that FIU violated bylaws concerning full-time enrollment, the five-year rule and progress-toward-degree requirements.

In addition, FIU incorrectly applied NCAA financial aid legislations from the academic years of 2004-05 through 2006-07 resulting in men's soccer, women's soccer and women's gulf exceeding NCAA financial aid limits.

An infraction report from Aug. 25, 2005 showed that FIU broke NCAA rules. Therefore, the recent allegations are the second record of FIU violating NCAA bylaws and is now subject to penalties under repeat violators, which may include the prohibition of some or all outside competition in the sport involved for one or two sports seasons.

FIU is required to send a written response with the necessary records to confirm or disprove the validity of the allegations by Dec. 4.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions is set to review the response Feb. 15-16, 2008. 

The NCAA will notify President Maidique of the official hearing date where he is required to attend. 

Select university representatives including current Athletic Director Pete Garcia, faculty athletics representative Stephen Fain and Sun Belt Conference Associate Commissioner Rick Mellom who served as athletic director from June 2000 through October 2006 are also mandated to attend the hearing.

The bulk of the violations occurred while Mello served at athletic director. He declined to comment on the matter,

Presently, the allegations are major violations, but the University may send evidence within the written response to reduce the allegations to secondary violations. 

According to the press release sent by FIU media relations, the University investigated and self-reported the transgressions to the NCAA.  Self-disclosure is considered when determining the penalties issued. 

After the hearing, if the NCAA Committee on Infractions still decides the allegations are major, FIU is subject to presumptive penalties. The reprimands include the termination of employment of all staff members who knowingly engaged in or condoned a major violation.

Every sport except tennis and softball was involved in at least one allegation.

Headline: PENNY PINCHING: Tuition increase lightens wallets
Author: Nicolle Garber / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Many students at FIU pay out of their own pocket for tuition. Their parents have their own financial responsibilities and so they must provide for themselves.  In that sense, the proposed 5 percent tuition increase is a cost that would greatly affect the residential student population. 

 Now 5 percent doesn't seem like a lot, but let us say you are taking 15 credits and you are an in-state, undergraduate student.  Each credit is approximately $113, so 5 percent of $113 is $5.67. Now multiply that by 15, and you get about $85. That is an extra $85 you would have to pay every semester-about two books for an English major and half a book for medical students. 

The implementation of a 5 percent increase would bring in about $9 million to FIU.  But that projection may not be correct if some students aren't be able to produce the extra $85.  Students who quit their jobs to attend FIU and pay out of pocket will also face a greater difficulty.  With no funds from a weekly job, they will have to take out more loans.  For students who have little or no financial aid, have no weekly income from a job, and rely solely upon loans to attend school will definitely feel the strain of the increase.  And students who have no job, no work-study, and no car to find a job will have to eat Ramen every day instead of every other day. 

Sure, $85 may seem insignificant but let us expand upon what $85 can buy.  With the $85 you can buy a $50 and $20 bus ticket to the Biscayne Bay Campus.  It can buy a George Foreman Grill for students who cannot afford a meal plan. The $85 can buy two boxes of color print paper for a photography student.  It can also help pay for a student's study abroad trip to Japan.  And lastly, $85 can buy gas for a week for a commuting student.

But those who will take the biggest financial hit are graduate students. 

 With their tuition totaling approximately $260 per credit, they are receiving the worst end of the tax increase.  Assuming they are taking 12 credits, they will have to pay an extra $156.   

Tara Lamp, a nursing student, stares wide-eyed as she hears about the increase.  Her bright smile fades as she contemplates her current financial disposition. "For the student whose every nickel, dime, and penny counts, it's a huge deal.  Not everyone is a Bright Futures scholar."

 If the tuition increase trend continues to climb in the near future, a proper education could soon become a luxury.

Headline: Military presence highlights inconsistencies in school policy
Author: Joseph Marhee / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As the U.S. government attests, "the greatest sacrifice a person can give is to that of his country," but homosexuals and bisexuals are rudely excluded from this 'honor.'

 According to the Armed Forces's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, members of the American homosexual community are both unfit to lead or to realize their full potential.

The "don't ask don't tell" policy forces homosexuals and bisexuals to bury their true identities and it stipulates that sexual orientation is a marker of a person's worth to society.

This policy is far reaching: it also applies to Reserve Officers Training Course (ROTC). ROTC provides 60 percent of the U.S. armed forces officers-they too cannot be  homosexual or bisexual.

While the policy may not seem like a big deal, it is when a discovered homosexual who was a veteran of two years in Iraq is retroactively denied their hard earned benefits. The explanation: discovered homosexuality is grounds for Dishonorable Discharge, meaning that benefits will not be granted. 	     That is a clear cut instance of  discrimination.

However, the policy's "Don't Pursue, Don't Harass" amendment, which protects those who are suspected of being homosexual from harassment, goes largely unrecognized. For example, in the case of Allen R. Schindler, Schindler  was brutally murdered in what is now called a "blanket party" (the practice of covering an officer with a blanket and attacking them).  The servicemen and several others who suspected that Schindler was gay left a "nearly-unrecognizable corpse," a fate much worse than being denied military benefits.

The policy itself is a huge step back for Americans who pride themselves of "living in the land of the free". Further segregating the straight from the gay community. The policy implies that sexual orientation is something of great importance and would suggest that someone not of the 'correct' orientation is of little use to the military, and of little value to society.

But federal legislature aside, by allowing ROTC and the Armed Forces to recruit on campus, FIU has taken a hypocritical stance towards homophobia and racism. Although in the process of hiring employees, the United Faculty of Florida agreed not to "discriminate against . . . any employee . . . based upon sexual orientation [and race]."

Therefore, by allowing ROTC and the Armed Forces on campus  FIU only advances homophobia and discrimination, and indirectly endorses them both.

So what allows a military recruitment presence at FIU?

Money.

The Supreme Court, in the case of Rumsfeld v. FAIR, upheld the Solomon Amendment, stating that the federal government could deny funds to schools that do not allow recruitment.

While it cannot be known for sure if that is FIU's reasoning for continuing to allow indirect discrimination, the ruling of the Solomon Amendment may play a big role in how FIU may be more of a victim than the perpetrator.

The ruling makes it difficult for the school to practice Equal Opportunities in all facets of decision making-like ROTC and other outside organizations that exist on campus. 

And because schools are under the law's heavy hand, they are left with few choices, other than to allow this to happen.  It is a prime example of how far our rights and even our school's motto can go; obviously, not very far.

Headline: Editorial: BOG decision best for all parties
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
From a gallon of milk to a gallon at the pump, everyday necessities become more and more expensive. Our education is no different. As The Beacon reported in its Oct. 1 issue, the Board of Governors unanimously voted to increase tuition by 5 percent, effective Spring 2008.

The increase amounts to roughly $5.67 per credit hour, which equals $68 per semester for students taking a full load of courses. In order for the increase to become a law, it must first be approved by the Florida House of Representatives and Senate; and then survive a possible veto by Gov. Charlie Crist, who already exercised his veto power this summer on a similar measure.

It is imperative that the legislature and governor both agree with the BOG's decision to increase tuition in the upcoming spring. The lack of funding for public universities has made increasing enrollment, recruiting faculty, staff and adding additional classes more difficult. Students have already felt the effects of a university system strapped for cash. The university-wide hiring freeze that was set in place, after the BOG told universities to prepare for a budget cut of 4 to 10 percent, has hurt students' chances of graduating as professors are needed to teach certain classes cannot be hired. 

Even if the university could hire faculty, who's to say they would come? 

Along with the hiring freeze, the budget cuts have also frozen salaries, making any current faculty ineligible for a raise. 

Not to mention the fact that this university is located in a state where property taxes are out of control, home insurance costs are astonishing, and the cost of living is among the highest in the country.

Even more troubling is this scenario: a qualified college-age student turned away by a publicly funded university as a result of capped enrollment. State universities are already behind in terms of public funding--Florida is ranked in the bottom half of the country in terms of support they receive in public dollars. 

The future of the public university system looks grim if this problem is not addressed soon. 

This is where the BOG's role becomes crucial. For the first time in its history, the BOG asserted the power given to it by Florida voters in 2003, preserved in its constitutional mission. 

In the Florida Constitution, is said the BOG was created to achieve excellence through teaching students, advancing research and providing public service for the benefit of Florida's citizens, their communities and economies, the people herby establish a systme of governance for the satte university system of Florida. 

The vote to raise tuition comes amid a power struggle between the Legislature and the BOG over who should have the authority to set tuition. The dispute will be decided in Florida's high courts.

It is common sense for the BOG to assume tuition setting responsibilities as they are an entity solely dedicated to the State's universities.  And only they can make a judgement in the best interest of students.

Headline: 'A Pair of Nuts' to perform
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
For students seeking a night of laughter, "A Pair of Nuts: The Comedy Duo" starring alumni Yamil Piedra and Johnny Trabanco will be performed at the Miami Improv Oct. 10 at 8:30 p.m. 

The show will consist of loosely improvised sketches and several videos in between the sketches. 

According to Trabanco, attendees can expect a lot of sketches about ridiculous situations. 

Both comedians described the show as being similar to late night comedy shows, but with only two people. 

"I've been watching "Saturday Night Live" since I was little," Piedra said. "Our show has a very SNL feel to it." 

The comedians won "Best South Florida Performance" at the 2007 Miami Improv Festival and were featured on BET's "We've Got to Do Better." The duo has been acting together since they joined FIU's Impromedy, an improv and sketch comedy troupe which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this semester. 

Piedra, an FIU alumnus, describes his stand up routines as being dry humor, but he has a lot of pride in his sketch comedy and acting skills. 

"I was an actor before I was a comedian," Piedra said. "I love them both equally, but you get that immediate reaction with comedy."

The actor/comedian has showed up on television a few times in various roles on shows such as "Boston Legal," "Las Vegas" and "Last Comic Standing."

Despite his TV spots, Piedra does not consider any one of his appearances a "big break" and is still waiting for it to happen. Until then, he has his routines and a degree in theatre from FIU to fall back on. 

The other "nut" is Trabanco, who is in radio sales during the day, but by night, is a self-proclaimed "sketch comedy genius of South Florida."

"We play off each other," Trabanco said. 

Trabanco said that his comedy career does not provide him much monetary support, but money is not the reason he does it. 

"I get a high off people laughing," Trabanco said. "If I can get a big group of people laughing, it's worth it." 

For a preview of what to expect at their show, visit www.myspace.com/pairofnuts. Several filmed sketches such as "Gayo" and "Flavor Farts" are posted on the site for viewing.

The cost for admission is $10 and if the show is successful enough, Trabanco said that the Miami Improv might pick up the show for several months. So, naturally the "nuts" are hopeful that Oct. 10 will be a big success.

"We're very excited about performing on the same stage as so many great comics," Piedra said in a press release. "It's an all new show that's gonna kick ass on all levels."	

Those interested in attending must be at least 18 years old to attend and 21 to drink.

Headline: Review: Heavenly Sword (Game)
Subheadline: Epic full of rich details
Author: Luis Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Heavenly Sword has been watched very closely by many Sony PlaysStation 3 owners since the system's launch. Sony and developer Ninja Theory's tale of revenge is finally here to captivate thrill-seekers with its martial arts finesse and fury.

The game is told through a series of flashbacks that chronicle the main character Nariko's path of vengeance against King Bohan after her people were ravaged and enslaved in his quest to claim the Heavenly Sword for power; 

Nariko's clan has long guarded the sword. Nariko, against the clan leader and her father's wishes, takes up the sword to save her clan, even at the cost of her own life.

Heavenly Sword's control is easy to pick up and play from the beginning. 

Two attack buttons and quick access to Nariko's different fighting styles by holding the L1 and R1 buttons allow for easy combinations and quick adapting for fighting enemies. 

Also at Nariko's disposal are super styles that instantly devastate one or multiple opponents. Defensive maneuvers such as evasive rolling, controlled through the left analog stick and countering oncoming attacks with a well-timed press of the Triangle button are simple to execute. 

At some points in the game, Heavenly Sword will change focus to Kai, a cross-bow wielding young orphan aiding Nariko in her quest with her skills. In these portions, use of the motion-sensing 'SIXAXIS controls' and the projectile view of the camera allow players to give the appropriate after touch to their aim for added precision. Nariko also has this skill when throwing objects in the environment, including prone-bodies.

Although the game is exhilarating and will keep players interested with its characters, six chapters leave it very short-lived. While challenging, determined players can finish the game within six or seven hours, perhaps less. 

There is a nice wealth of content to discover, such as added combat moves, concept art, interviews with developers and the extra difficult hell mode.

Heavenly Sword is a grand showcase of the PS3's power. Much detail went into crafting the characters that inhabit the cinema-influenced landscape. 

Whether its facial expressions, waterfalls or Nariko's flowing hair, the game spares no expense in visual presentation. 

Much of the beauty of it is watching the action as Nariko dispatches foe after foe with grace, fluidity and pain. 

The sounds and music of the game contribute to the visual flair. Adding further to the experience is superb scripting of the story and acting that bring the characters to life. Andy Serkis (Gollum of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) in the role of King Bohan, in particular, is a sight to behold.

Heavenly Sword is meant to be savored for every moment and shows that short stories can captivate as much as an expansive epic.

Headline: Commentary: FALLING BEHIND: Conditioning, chemistry to blame for men's soccer slow start
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
"Where's the beef?" asked the little old lady from the Wendy's advertisement made famous during the 1980s.

Now, FIU men's soccer fans might find themselves asking, "Where's the offense?"

Five goals in the first nine games of the season have resulted in zero wins for the offensively challenged men's squad. The team's record is 0-7-2 through those nine games.

The defense has kept the team in most games, averaging 1.8 goals allowed per game. But lack of conditioning, disoriented team chemistry and the inability to finish have fused to kill the Golden Panthers' offense.

At the start of the season, the players looked out of shape. Coach Munga Eketebi made several substitutions early because of his players' fatigue. This resulted in less scoring opportunities and a disadvantage in time of possession.

Opposing defenders had no trouble tackling and stripping the ball from the slow Golden Panther midfielders and forwards. 

Their stamina improved after a few games, but the rust wouldn't rub off as their lack of communication led to several spoiled scoring chances, causing crosses out of players' reach and passes to opposing defenders.

On several occasions, a player passed the ball to absolutely no one, hoping that a teammate was going to appear.  

Plays like that always ended with a loss of possession rather than a scoring attack.

The best offensive game of the season so far was against Illinois-Chicago in which midfielder Juan Guerra scored two goals with the help of forward Levi Coleman. 

For a two-game stretch, Guerra and Coleman showed signs of life for the Golden Panthers' offense, but Coleman's playing time was cut down significantly because of an injury he sustained against Marshall. 

Guerra was overwhelmed in that game by numerous defenders.

For an offense to gel together, the whole offense needs to understand each other. Besides Guerra and Coleman, there has not been another team member who has exhibited consistent team chemistry.

Guerra is the best ball handler on the team and he breaks down defenses better than any one. However, teams have taken note of this and have begun to double-team him. When he is double-teamed, other players should come help him and make themselves available to receive the ball. Instead, they have left him out to dry too many times this season.

Scoring chances for the men's club have not been excessive, but there have been enough to score more than the four total goals scored this year, the fifth was an own goal by the University of Connecticut. 

Two glaring, constant mistakes have ruined scoring opportunities for the offense: hesitation and poor decision-making.

The majority of offensive plays near the penalty box involve a player dribbling towards the goal only to stop briefly, looking for other teammates rather than taking the initiative and shooting. That brief pause allows the lagging defenders to catch up and block off the Golden Panther attack.

The same moments of hesitation also allow the goalie to charge the offensive player and grab the ball.

There's a time to shoot long range and short range. The Golden Panthers have yet to figure out when is the right time to shoot either. 

Ill-advised shots from more than 30 yards out have not produced one goal thus far this season. But they have led to soccer balls landing near the Pharmed Arena or the baseball stadium.

Conversely, there have been several plays in which a player is inside the penalty box and refuses to shoot in time. The Golden Panthers either pull the trigger too soon or never take the pin off the grenade. 

Nine games mark the mid-way point of the regular season. Considering they have not won, the regular season is probably as far as they'll go 2007. The change in head coaches from Karl Kremser to Eketebi has been rough so far. 

The mild-mannered Eketebi does not show much emotion on the field, but there is no way he could be happy with his team's offense and overall record.

Only one more question can be asked about the men's soccer team: "When does next season start?"

Headline: Women's Volleyball: Tomic reaches milestone with win
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Danijela Tomic, the brains behind the Sun Belt Conference powerhouse that is the Golden Panthers women's volleyball team, picked up her 50th career victory in a win over conference foe Florida Atlantic Oct. 2 at Pharmed Arena.

The Golden Panthers cruised to a dominant 3-0 (30-20, 30-23, 30-22) win, giving Tomic's resume a slight facelift in the process. 

In just 73 games Tomic hit the coveted 50 win mark, making her the fastest Golden Panther volleyball coach to ever achieve such a feat. Dr. Judith Blucker, the program's first coach, had the previous record as she made it to 50 wins in 93 matches in 1975.

After the game, the always humble Tomic down played her achievement. 

"I am happy and I am humbled," Tomic said. "I don't do my job to break records or to put my name in the record books. I am just trying to coach these kids and make a difference and I think that when you do things the right way, the results will come."

Understandably overshadowed by Tomic's milestone was an excellent overall performance by the Golden Panthers. Sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa continued to impress as she delivered a match-high 14 kills on a .360 hitting clip. The second half of the team's 1-2 punch, sophomore Olga Vergun, had 12 kills, and senior Anita Szmanska had 11 kills on a scorching .786 clip.

Freshman setter Natalia Valentin continued to get more comfortable orchestrating the Golden Panther offense as she posted her fourth double-double of the season with a match-high 46 assists to go along with 10 digs. Freshman power hitter Ines Medved added eight kills in the victory. 

The win was the ninth in a row for the Golden Panthers, who maintained their perfect SBC record at 6-0 and improved to a 11-2 on the season overall. Meanwhile, the Owls seem to still be asleep so far this season. The loss dropped them four games below the .500 mark at 6-10 and dropped them to 3-3 in the SBC.

Despite the win streak, Tomic says there is always room for improvement and wants the team to stay focused.

"I am pleased with the progress we are making in different areas, but most coaches will always find something that their team can improve on and that's the way I am," Tomic said. "Looking at our winning streak, I think it is nice but the main thing for us is to not focus on records. We need to focus on every match that we play everyday and treat it as the most important match of he season. So far we have been doing that and that's why we are in a good place in the standings."

For Tomic, the 50th win is the latest on the long list of accolades she has received in her coaching career. Two years ago, in her debut season, she led the Golden Panthers to a 12-win turn around and a No. 6 seed in the SBC tournament. 

Last year, she pushed the young team to the brink of success - leading them to a 24-8 regular season, a share of the Sun Belt title with Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky and an appearance in the conference tournament's championship game. 

Despite falling short at the end of the season, everyone took note of Tomic and she was named the Sun Belt Conference Coach of The Year.

Thirteen games into this season her team is sitting atop the SBC East Division standings.

&nbsp;
Krishnan Dandapani, professor of finance in the College of Business Administration, was the winner of the Council of 100 Outstanding award at this year's Faculty Convocation and Awards Ceremony.

Held Oct. 5 at the Nicole and Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the ceremony recognizes every year faculty for their outstanding work, from publishing important papers to cittercrams and securing over 15 million in funding.

Aside from the recognition, the award also consists of a $10,000 award.   

Dandapani was completely surprised by the award and was glad to receive the support of his community, he said, and added that he hopes this recognition will draw attention to the initiatives he is championing now. 

Dandapani is currently working with the Asian studies program to establish an "educational link" between the United States, India and China because that area of the world is growing greatly, he says. 

Dandapani's other major work is a book about hurricane litigation and the financial affects of hurricanes, which he has been working on for 10 years and will come out this year.

Faculty Awards of Excellence in six areas were also awarded during the ceremony. The areas included: teaching, research, service, undergraduate advising, graduate mentorship and adjunct faculty. 

In all, 31 faculty members were given accolade.

"Today we celebrate education," said Kalai Mathee, associate professor and chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the opening of the ceremony.

FIU president Modesto Maidique addressed the audience about the affect recent budget cuts and tuition increases in the state of Florida.

"I speak to you today with a sense of relief," Maidique said. "With the help of our friends in legislator and elsewhere, we have beaten back the ignoble proposals that were made relative to our budget."

Maidique assured the audience that FIU's goals would not be affected by the proposed budget cuts, while at the same time warning of hard times to come.

"This is not to say that we don't have a bumpy road ahead," Maidique said. 

To combat the cuts, Maidique said FIU will have to secure more funding from the private sector, rework the Florida Bright Futures scholarship program and raise tuition to "just the national average."  

Maidique also assured the cuts would not affect the opening of the new University medical school slated to open in. 

Faculty Senate chairperson Bruce Hauptli turned the attention away from politics and back to the faculty and their accomplishments.

"Our University is a vibrant academic community because of your collective efforts and accomplishments," Hauptli said.

Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
In order to foster student involvement with the community, the Student Government Council of the University Park campus approved $1,500 to fund the Adopt-a-Player Program. The goal of the program is to promote panther pride at FIU and the surrounding community. 

"This is a program I wanted to start," said Jennifer Ruiz, speaker of the house for SGC-UP and founder of the Adopt-a-Player program. "I wanted it to be an SGA event."

The SGC-UP is funding 100 percent of the program with Athletics essentially donating the time and commitment of the football players. 

The program involves 20 FIU organizations adopting one of 20 FIU football team players by showing their support for that player during the next home game Nov. 17.

"All they're really looking for is support," Ruiz said.   

Any FIU organization can participate.  

A meet-and-greet pep rally is being planned for various FIU organizations to meet the players and make a choice as to who they want to sponsor.  

 Once a player has been adopted, the organization would be responsible for having at least 10 of their members root for that player. 

"It will boost moral and build partnerships," Ruiz said. 

In return for attending the home games and rooting for the players, each adopted player will attend two events a semester hosted by or involving the organization that adopted them.

Mario Cristobal head coach of the FIU football team is enthusiastic over the possibilities the program may lead to. 

According to Cristobal, all of the players have reacted well to the program. 

"They do not have much time to interact with the student body," Cristobal said. 

Cristobal hopes that the Adopt-a-Player program will grow beyond the 20 initial players. Details regarding the exact implantation are still being determined, but Ruiz is confident the program will be a success for the Louisiana-Lafayette match Nov. 17. 

"Bottom line is that this will generate support," Cristobal said.

Headline: Group brings race forums
Author: Daniella Bacigalupo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Silent, somber, black-shirted FIU students surrounded the Graham Center Pit last February; a sour culmination to the much anticipated Pan-African Celebration that should have admired the richness and variety of African culture. 

"Not My History," the motto of the Pan-African protests, whose activists claimed the Pan-African Celebration did not accurately represent a black celebration, exemplifies the race problem that American society has: lack of cultural awareness, recognition and racial prejudice. 

At least Hashim Benford, a member of the Black Student Union, thinks so. Inspired by the protests, he approached the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services seeking collaboration to introduce a nationwide program next Spring called Campus Conversations on Race.

As a result, FIU will be among the 11 universities adopting a program that aims to foster racial understanding through student-led, open discussions that explore racial prejudice.

Benford believes a college setting is ideal to conduct a forum like this one because of the abundance of students available that can bring their leadership, energy and opinions into the race discourse. 

MPS has selected 10 student facilitators who will be coached through sessions of race-themed conferences through Fall where they'll be exposed to different race topics that will prepare them to guide college-wide conversations. For Kathleen Black, who was chosen as a facilitator, recognition of racial differences is the first step to solving race-related problems.

"It is important to be able to talk about race. People like to think that they are more open to [racial conversations] than they really are. While our population is diverse on campus, it is still uncomfortable to acknowledge our differences," Black said.

The college-wide conversations next Spring will be structured into separate groups. Two facilitators will lead each group and four students will be asked to participate in them. 

MPS hopes the discussions will be constructive forum to explore different viewpoints on race themes. 

A topic will be selected to begin each session but conversation will be "as organic as possible," Benford said.

Hate crime incidents such as the Jena 6 and the recent race-motivated attack on FIU student Stephen Barrnett will be potential launching pads to discuss questions like, "What is the nature of the racial problem?" Benford said.

Although FIU has a multiethnic community, Benford explains diversity does not equal racial tolerance. 

Benford hopes CCOR will eventually develop from "words to action."

Headline: Officer speaks about life, job
Author: Jessica Solis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
To many who know him, Bill King can be considered accessible. As the director of Public Safety, King tries to make sure that the University police department he supervises is as approachable as he is.

A man who has been involved in the field of law enforcement for the past 33 years, King initially did not believe he would ever become a police officer. 

After majoring in sociology and playing football and basketball at Wayne State University in Detroit, Mich., King said an interest in law enforcement was sparked by his long-term goals.

"People come into law enforcement thinking that they can make a difference and serve the public," King said. "I think it's all about service and being able to offer a variety of services to the community." 

After recruitment efforts to enlist minority candidates into the field of law enforcement arrived in his hometown, King decided to become a police officer.

"I had negative experiences with police officers before that and really thought I could change the perception of police officers while help others," King said.

He began his career working as a state trooper with Michigan State Police, where he worked for 25 years. He later became deputy chief of police of the Ypsilanti Police Department in Ypsilanti, Mich. It was during this time where he began his transition to university police, which he believes is not that different to off-campus police departments. 

King eventually returned to WSU, this time as chief of its police department. But after three years, a warmer opportunity came calling.

"I saw the position open at FIU and, to get out of the cold weather, FIU and Miami seemed to be a very attractive position," King said.

King has been the chief of the FIU police department since 2004. Working with a younger, more proactive population has impressed him, "the enthusiasm they have about working with the other students, faculty and staff and the enthusiasm they have about their lives and their careers," King said.

He has no specific favorite part of his job, but said he appreciates the opportunities he has meeting new people as well as with the people he works with. 

Those he works with say feeling is mutual.

"I feel that he performs his duties in a professional and courteous manner," said Beatriz Villa, senior secretary. 

"He also has an open-door policy. If he's here and a student comes in that needs to see him, he welcomes them."

King hopes that the University understands the objectives of Public Safety and will ultimately cultivate a positive image of the department.

"I think we've been very reactive to any situations that have come up on campus and I think we've been valuable in providing a good level of service for all of the University community," King said.

FIU's athletic training program evaluated 

FIU could become the first University in Florida to have an accredited entry-level master's program in athletic training if it's approved by two representatives from the Commission on Accreditation for Athletic Training Education who will visit the University Oct. 17 through Oct. 19.

Athletic trainers specialize in the prevention and rehabilitation of injuries in physically-active individuals. If the program is accredited, FIU will join the 17 universities in the country already offering the program.

During the three-day visit, CAATE representatives will inspect both the school's on and off campus facilities to make sure they meet compliance and accreditation standards; they will also interview deans, faculty, students, as well as the medical director and athletic trainers involved in the program. 

"Accreditation is key because students have to graduate from an accredited program to be eligible to sit for the board of certification exam," said Jennifer Doherty-Restrepo, athletic training chair and program director. 

CAATE will announce its decision by next February, just in time for the first graduating master's class to be able to meet the board exam requirements.

Headline: Accident survivors promote boat safety
Author: Maria Chercoles / News Director
&nbsp;
One year after the boat accident during the Columbus Day Regatta that killed two FIU students and injured many others, some of the survivors - together with friends and relatives -returned to the regatta site, but this time with a different purpose. 

Need help? Just light the way is the name of the campaign they founded to create awareness about the dangers of the ocean, which they believe will help prevent more accidents such as the one that killed students Monica Burgera and James Noel Pou last year.
 
"We couldn't let this happen again, so we though that by telling other people what happened to us and informing them about boat safety was the best way to prevent it," said Andres Perez, who survived the accident that took the life of his girlfriend for more than four years, Burguera; and his roommate, Noel Pou. 
 
The accident took place when their broken-down rental boat, which was being towed back to shore, was hit from behind by a 35-foot powerboat. 
 
Together with Burguera's family and about 100 volunteers, Perez spent last weekend's regatta distributing flyers, t-shirts, hats and flashlights at 14 different marinas throughout Miami.  

"We went through such a hard time that we don't want anyone else to go through the same. Saving one life will make the effort worth it," said Mayra Burguera, the mother of Monica Burguera.

Need Help? was financed by the Burguera family and supported by friends and relatives. 
A Web site and a Facebook.com group helped spread the word about it and quickly found solidarity among the FIU community. The Facebook group reached over 1,000 members in just three days. 

Also as part of the campaign, the Burguera family decorated a boat with Burguera's and Noel Pou's picture and approached regatta boaters to hand them safety information and remind them of the dangers of the ocean. 
 
"Young people come to these events without considering the dangers of the ocean," Mayra Burguera said. 

Perez is now trying to reincorporate into his life after having to drop from FIU last Fall. The accident left him with a broken hip and pelvis that paralyzed the lower part of his body. 

Although doctors told him that he might not be able to walk again, therapy in Miami and later in Puerto Rico helped him recover. Still, he can't run yet and continues doing therapeutic exercises. 

The accident also cost him a finger and a broken wrist.
 
However, he said, the injuries is not what hurt him the most:

"The physical damage is not the most severe. Medicine is so advanced that I was able to receive the help I needed, but the psychological damage of losing Monica and James is the hardest part," Perez said.     

Perez reincorporated to FIU this Fall to finish the last two years of his bachelor's in health sciences and nutrition. He wants to be an orthopedic, he jokes, to "return the favor." 

His family flew from Puerto Rico for the weekend and stood next to him as he distributed flyers to everyone entering the Key Biscayne Crandon Marina.
 
Joel Cardona, Angel Accornero and Jose Gonzalez, who were also in the accident last year, helped with the Need Help? campaign. The rest of the accident survivors are currently in Puerto Rico.
 
The accident left Cardona with a fractured clavicle and crane and with severe cuts throughout his back, but he agrees with Perez in that the injuries are what matter the least.

"They were very special people. You wouldn't have over a hundred volunteers working all weekend like this for everyone," Cardona said.
 
Despite his injuries, Cardona returned to FIU weeks after the accident and is currently finishing his second year in the architecture master's program.
 
"What drove my decision not to leave school was that I believed that continuing my studies and life was the best way I could cope with my recovery rather than staying at home thinking about what happened," Cardona said.  
 
Perez and Cardona received psychological counseling to help them reincorporate into their lives, and Cardona said the accident did have a certain effect on academics, but added that FIU has been very sensitive to the situation by sending cards, letters and even calling the victims and families involved.
 
Perez feels good to be back in FIU and added that now that he is taking all the classes he dropped last fall, the same professors who sent him letters last year recognized him and have been helpful. 
 
"It was a difficult part of my life, but it's a chapter I want to close. I wanted to come back to FIU and finish my studies. It's difficult, but I'm here, fighting," Perez said.
 
The Burguera family is now trying to start a foundation to change and reinforce the water safety rules.
 
The campaign was already effective this year, Perez said.
 
Contrary to last year, no jet skis were allowed in the area this time. Also, a number of people were arrested Saturday night for drunk boating.
 
"Seeing so many of us volunteering, the golf guards are realizing the size of the problem and now are enforcing more the rules," Perez said.
 
Opposite to what one would assume, Perez and Cardona still enjoy the ocean and admire boats. While distributing flyers, they couldn't take their eyes away from some of the luxurious boats entering the marina. 

Perez said he returned to the accident site after recuperating to throw flowers to the water.
 
"It's like a car accident. Those things happen and it doesn't mean you won't ride a car again. You have to understand it could happen to anyone, anywhere," Perez said.

Headline: Lecture commemorates abolition's bicentenary
Author: Michelle Vega / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As 2007 marks the bicentenary of the British abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, FIU's Ninth Annual Eric E. Williams Memorial Lecture, held Oct. 5 at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, sought to address critical issues of the commerce of enslaved Africans and its abolition. 

Emancipation, the African Atlantic and the Long Road to Freedom was the title of this year's lecture, which presented key note speakers Joseph Inikori, professor of at the University of Rochester and author of Africans and the Industrial Revolution in England: A Study in International Trade and Economic Developmen; and Verene Shepherd, professor of social history at the University of the West Indies and author of I Want to Disturb my Neighbor: Lectures on Slavery, Emancipation and Post-Colonial Jamaica.  

Even rainfall on Friday evening failed to stall attendance: approximately 300 guests attended the lecture, which was established in 1999 and is part of the African-New World Studies Program's Distinguished Africana Scholars Lecture Series.

The lecture began with WPLG, Channel 10 Anchor Nikki Mohan, who welcomed to the stage Akin Ogundira, FIU's dean of the African-New World Studies. 

As Ogundira stood spoke, he thanked the audience for attending, the organizers, the co-sponsors and the speakers for their contribution to the event. During his introductory speech, he gladly commented on the 5 percent yearly increase in admissions to the African-New World Studies Program.  He concluded by stating his ultimate goal for the program and that is, "To make this program the best African-American program in the world!" 

Inikori based his lecture on Eric William's 63-year-old work Capitalism and Slavery, as he illustrated his theme of morality versus economic and political enslavement. Inikori traced history's immoral beliefs and reasoning on African slavery, as he interpreted Aristotle's definition of a slave-"the tool with the voice". 

Inikori also correlated both Asian enslavement in Europe and African enslavement in Britain during the medieval period and in the end, allowed one question to linger among his audience, "Why was Asian and medieval slavery tolerated and how did they come to an end?"

"Angry Black Women Take Action" was the backbone of Shepherd's lecture, as she spoke up for the women who escaped and/or who triumphed over slavery. She provided personal anecdotes-both humorous and graphic-of women that lived through destabilization as a result of enslavement. 

Shepherd emphasized the strength women possessed to outlive the domestic system-the strength of those who resisted and those who accommodated. "Both men and women alike paid reparations for their own liberations from slavery," Shepherd concluded.

Other speakers who were called up to the podium this year were: FIU's Dean of Arts and Sciences Mark D. Szuchman-- who in his speech traced the history of historians and their efforts in informing later generations of the malice towards enslaved Africans; Miami-based Consul General of Trinidad and Tobago Gerard Greene-who gave an honorary speech on Eric Williams' his contributions to make people more informed and to encourage them to act against racial cruelty; and Ida Tefayra-who, alongside Ogundira, honored FIU's former FIU Provost and current Chancellor at Florida's Board of Governors Mark B. Rosenberg with a plaque for his contribution to the development of multi-cultural education and his work in Africano studies. 

Established in 1999, the lecture pays tribute to the renowned Eric E. Williams, who served as first Prime Minister of Trinidad and head of government for a quarter of a century until the year of his death. 

Prior speakers include John Hope Franklin, one of America's leading African American historians; Kenneth Kaunda, former President of the Republic and Zambia; Beverly Anderson-Manley, former First Lady of Jamaica;and  prize-winning Haitian author Edwige Danticat.

The event has been supported by the Eric Williams Memorial Collection at the University of the West Indies-named to UNESCO's exalted Memory of the World Register in 1999. 

Admission to the event was free and open to the public and was preceded by an open reception in the pavilion of Wertheim Performing Arts Center, where there were books published by Eric Williams, Joseph Inikori and Verene Shepherd displayed on tables for sale and signing. 

The reception also featured of a cultural buffet; a raffle for a trip from Miami to Trinidad or to Guiana and a one-man band who played Jamaican reggae sounds on steel drums by the entrance to the auditorium.
