Headline: Pageant raises $1,242 for children's charity
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity held its annual Pike Dream Girl pageant last Thursday night in the Graham Center Ballroom.  This year's proceeds, $1,242, benefit the Children's Miracle Network, a national organization that operates locally at Miami Children's Hospital.

"We try to emphasize the Greek system's impact on FIU. We chose the Children's Miracle Network because so many other FIU organizations [including Student Government Association and Dance Marathon] are so strongly behind it," said Manny Niebla, president of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Fraternity events coordinator Dustin Mangas and the reigning Pike Dream Girl, Devon Lopez, hosted the event.

Since the pageant began in 1994,  it has taken place each fall with the exception of last semester, due to a scheduling conflict.

Selecting a Pike Dream Girl is a tradition for Pi Kappa Alpha members nationwide, Niebla said. "She is a representative of the values of Pi Kappa Alpha."

Pre-sale tickets went on sale Feb. 9. Tickets were sold for $8 in advance and $10 at the door. 

Niebla estimated that more than 150 people attended the pageant.

Seventeen ladies participated and 15 were members of Greek organizations. Greek membership, however, was not a requirement or even a consideration for judges. 

"Other than being a female student at FIU, there are no requirements whatsoever [to run]," Niebla said.

Three of the five judges are current FIU faculty and staff; the other two are alumni of both the university and the fraternity. 

The pageant began more than an hour late. 

"Technical difficulties caused the delay," said Alex Garcia, the public relations chairman.

Alex Prado, the Pike's vice president of external operations and the person who actually organized the evening, said the most difficult part about putting on the show was, "the little things, like making sure the tickets got here on time, sponsorships, prizes for the winners - things like that."

The Pike Dream Girl competition itself consisted of both business attire and an evening gown competition. 

During the business attire competition, the professionally-dressed contestants came out on stage and spoke about themselves, highlighting their hopes, hobbies, and achievements. 

In the evening gown competition a few minutes later, the ladies spoke a little bit more about themselves. There is no talent competition in this pageant.

"Our objective in the competition is to get to know the contestants as best as possible. To do this we ask them a series of questions instead of asking them to perform a talent because it gives the judges a better opportunity to know what the contestants are all about," Niebla said.

A list of 10 finalists was narrowed down to five after a brief interview with each contestant. Then a winner and four runners-up were chosen from this group. 

After a few hours of intense competition, Linette Gallo was crowned Ms. Pike Dream Girl 2003. 

"Now that I've officially been crowned, I can continue to support [Pi Kappa Alpha] and officially represent them too," she said. 

Gallo received an assortment of prizes, such as a makeover at Monet Coiffure, a gift certificate to Tiffany's, a Doral Spa package, dinner for two at Zba in the Gables and three weeks of etiquette and refinement classes.  

"She's allowed to wear our official shirt and lavaliere with our letters," Prado said.

Headline: 'Ssshhh Lecture Series' hopes to foster unity among blacks
Author: Luisa Flores/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Student Programming Council's Pan-African Committee hosted a lecture titled "Black Inter-ethnic Rivalry: the Black Dilemma," at the Graham Center's Panther Suite on Feb.12.

Professor and FIU alumnus Michael Barnett presented the view that very few blacks accept the notion of Pan-Africanism.

Barnett, who holds a Ph.D. in sociology, has done intensive research on black inter-ethnic rivalry since his graduate studies.

The lecture is one of several talks, collectively called "Ssshhh Lecture Series," scheduled as part of the programming for Black History month. 

The series of lectures address topics such as ignorance and misconceptions brought about by mainstream radio, propaganda, genocide in Continental Africa, and inter-ethic rivalry among blacks. 

The purpose of the series is to promote awareness of these important but seldom talked about issues.

This particular lecture series topic was inspired by Pan-African Committee Chairperson Darnelle Mason, a junior majoring in occupational therapy.

Mason's observations of tension between black African-Americans, Caribbean blacks, and blacks from Continental Africa, among students and organizations concerned him.

"Inter-ethnic rivalry is a big problem in the United States as well as in FIU. My hope was to bring people to discuss this topic and having them realize that we should stand together," Mason said.

The evening began with a brief video portraying tension between light-skinned blacks and dark-skinned blacks in the Dominican Republic.

Barnett said many people who immigrate to this country from Africa or the Caribbean dislike being grouped with African-Americans.  

These immigrants feel that African-Americans are seen in a negative context in the United States and being categorized as an African-American would prevent them from achieving social mobility.

Because of this, Caribbean blacks and blacks from Continental Africa practice social distancing in the hope of getting better treatment from Caucasians. 

These immigrants do not necessarily see the common circumstance of race as enough to come under the same category as African- Americans.

"People don't realize that realities among the different groups are not the same, it's because of this that they resist being categorized with African Americans," said Bassidy Dembele a senior majoring in international business said.  He is originally from Mali.

Barnett said the culture of Continental Africans and Caribbean Blacks are different from that of African-Americans, hence they resent being grouped under a monolithic label because of their skin color.

"Caribbean people do things differently from African Americans, our culture is different from theirs," said Nina Nines, a freshman majoring in international business. She is originally from Jamaica.

Caribbean blacks and some continental Africans have not experienced being an under-represented minority or discrimination such as the Jim Crow laws, that prevented African-Americans from having the same civil rights as whites, and they have a different mindset as recent immigrants, Barnett said.  Caribbean blacks generally tend to associate with continental Africans and vice versa rather than with African-Americans. 

Most of these immigrants come from regions or countries where the majority of people are black and, therefore, race is not an issue.

"Race is no big deal in the Caribbean because everyone is generally black, so the notion of black pride was never drilled in me as a child. People are classified by their social status or nationality rather than their skin color in these predominantly black regions," said Natalie Guy, a second generation Jamaican and a sophomore majoring in health services.

Barnett said African-Americans view the attitudes of Caribbean blacks and Continental Africans as snobbery. They see them as being insensitive to their plights in history. Caribbean and Continental blacks see African Americans as being too caught up in the notion of racial discrimination rather than seizing available opportunities. However, black East Africans can relate to African-Americans because of their past experience with colonization, oppression, and slavery. African-Americans feel that all three groups should unite to create a more powerful force.

"When we ask Continental Africans and Caribbean blacks to consider yourselves as being black we are not asking you to give up your heritage or nationality. We only ask that you realize that you fall under the category of being black," said Gerald Nieves-Caro, who is a criminal justice major.

"African-Americans view the reality being that nationality will not distinguish Caribbean blacks and Continental Africans from African- Americans in the Caucasian mindset," said senior Dominic Pearson. "Whites make no distinction between nationalities. To them if you are black, you're black." 

The complexity and sensitivity of this issue was seen in the heated discussion that went long into the night. Both Barnett and Mason hailed the event as a complete success. 

"After the session, I felt a greater understanding of other black ethnic groups' perspectives and ... that's what we need ultimately: more understanding of each other," Barnett said. 

"All the events so far have been fabulous; as long as you reach one person, the event can be considered a success." Mason said.

Headline: Republican policies help corporations, rich Americans
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
A while back, I read an article published in The Beacon that discussed the poor job prospects FIU graduates face in our struggling economy.

Well, it ain't getting any better, unless of course you want to believe President Bush and U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart.  

What is it about Republicans?  

They want to create a reality that just does not exist.  They skew facts, manipulate data, and lie to us about everything.  

Diaz-Balart said, the economic future looks bright.  The job market is growing, barely.  

Diaz-Balart claims that 112,000 Americans found jobs in December and that this is the largest monthly increase since December of 2000. For those Americans out of work, I only wish all this was accurate.  The congressman goes on to state that more than 366,000 Americans found jobs over the last five months.  

Between July and December 2003, the Bushies projected an "average growth of 306,000 jobs a month," according to the Economic Policy 
Institute's web posting. In fact, the predicted job creation figure for the month of January of 150,000 came up short.  According to the Bush administration's Labor Department, only 3,000 jobs were added across America in January.  

That's 20 jobs per state.  Some job growth.  

Instead, the country has suffered the "greatest sustained job loss since the Great Depression." In December alone, the manufacturing sector lost 26, 000 jobs.  

What we need to remember is that Bush's first tax cut was supposed to generate 800,000 new jobs and it has not.  

Remember when the White House told us that "The president has proposed $726 billion in tax relief to create ... a total of 1.4 million jobs by the end of [2004]"? Not.  What it has done is provide the wealthiest 1 percent of the population with about $54,000 in tax benefits, whereas the average working family got $256.      

The congressman claims that the national unemployment rate in January fell from its level of 6.3 percent in June 2003.  Supposedly, this is the fastest seven-month decline in nearly a decade.  Right!  

I understand that the jobless rate fell from 5.9 percent to 5.7 percent. In addition, for the second year in a row, payroll has fallen.  Real wages for blue-collar workers fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter.  

Bush continues to push for mercantile and currency policies that will create an overseas hemorrhage of high-tech and service jobs, not to mention an astonishing $100 billion U.S. trade deficit.  Bush has effectively stymied the hopes of raising the minimum wage and has stripped millions of workers of overtime pay. 

Do I need to mention the deficit?  It is $521 billion and growing.  Oh, but no need to worry about the deficit says Mr. Bush. 

He has a plan that will cut the deficit in half over the next five years.  

But according to the Brookings institute, the Committee for Economic Development and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Bush's plan does not take into account several key costs that must be added to make it realistic.  

In fact, "the administration's forthcoming budget is expected to have approximately $200 billion in missing costs in the fifth year."  Mr. Bush and Mr. Diaz-Balart need a reality check.   

Since Bush has been in office, this country has lost almost 3 million jobs since March of 2001.  Most job losses have been in manufacturing, as corporations find Bushenomic incentives to move off shore and those are jobs that will not be coming back.  

How does this compare to real economic recovery?  According to the Economic Policy Institute, during the last economic recovery under Clinton, at about the same time in his administration, the EPI stated the nation was adding on average 200,000 new jobs each month.  

Something is not jiving here.  

The war on terrorism is only a minor influence on this hemorrhage of jobs. We are years away from 9-11 and this administration continues to use it as an excuse. It continues to redistribute resources from the poor and the middle class to the rich.

This economic disaster has everything to do with fiscal and economic policies implemented by this administration.  

It is not properly addressing a nation in recession.  It is not assisting working class Americans with finding jobs.  It is supporting big corporations, destroying the environment, and is more preoccupied with capital than with workers and social issues.  

The Republican agenda is failing the majority of Americans. Diaz-Balart had better realize that it is about the economy and accountability and integrity.  We are getting tired of the obfuscation and misrepresentation of facts. 

Then again, he is a Republican.

Subheadline: FIU defeats Fla. Gulf Coast, falls short in SBC game vs. Arkansas Little-Rock
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Feb. 12 - FIU 77, FGCU 70	

It took a Division II opponent in Florida Gulf Coast University, but a win is a win nonetheless.

FIU finally ended its 10-game losing streak with a 77-70 victory over the Eagles at the Golden Panther Arena Feb. 12.

Belco Bamba scored a career-high 23 points on 10 of 15 shooting, as FIU won for the first time since Dec. 27. Raphael daSilva and Marcus Robinson added 13 and 12 points, respectively.

The Eagles led by as many as 10 points in the first half, holding an early 18-8 advantage. Going into intermission, FIU trailed 36-30.

The Golden Panthers trailed by nine points early in the second half, but rallied back as Bamba scored seven of FIU's next nine points, closing the gap to 46-41 with 13:32 to go.

FIU got its second lead of the game with 10:25 to play after a Bamba layup, putting FIU up 50-49.

But FGCU rallied and took the lead once again, 61-60, on a three-point basket by Bryan Crislip. 

FIU answered back by scoring the next eight points on a Robinson bucket, a three-point play by Warren Gale and a pair of Carlos Morban free throws.

With 32 seconds left to play, FGCU drew within three, 73-70, after a layup by Leighton Bowie, who led all scores with 26 points on 11 of 17 shooting. 

FIU finally closed out the game on a pair of free throws by Robinson and a bucket by Gabriel Lazo.

FIU shot 58 percent in the second half and held FGCU to 32 percent after allowing the Eagles to shoot 55 percent in the first half.

The Golden Panthers also visited the free throw line 24 times in the second half, after only two attempts in the first half.	

FIU improved to 4-17 with the victory, marking the team's third win in its last 19 games.

Feb. 14 - UALR 62, FIU 46

Coming off its first win in 11 games, FIU was unable to keep the success going as it fell to 0-9 in conference play with a 62-46 loss to Arkansas-Little Rock on the road Feb. 14.

Despite shooting 48 percent for the game, FIU was stymied by a season-high 28 turnovers. 

The Golden Panthers also out-rebounded the Trojans 30-26, but took 15 fewer shots. 

FIU was down 27-19 in the first half after the team turned the ball over in its first three possessions of the game, setting the tone for the Trojans. 

FIU did capture the lead once, on a Harry Lum layup with 9:57 remaining, giving FIU an 11-10 lead.

With 11:16 to play in the game, Bamba scored to pull FIU within seven at 39-32. 

But that would be the closest FIU would get as the Trojans went on an 11-2 run, led by Zack Wright, who finished with 12 points.

Guard Brandon Freeman also added 12 points for UALR, despite shooting only three for 11. 

No FIU player cracked double digits as daSilva led the Golden Panthers with nine points and four rebounds.

With 1:36 left to play in the game, Freeman took his team on a 7-0 run as he scored two buckets and hit a three-pointer. 

The Golden Panthers played without Carlos Morban, who did not make the road trip after being suspended for violating team rules. FIU did count on Lum's return. He missed the previous two games with a thumb injury.

FIU now stands at 4-18 on the season and has lost 13 straight SBC games. 

With the win, the Trojans climbed into a first-place tie with Western Kentucky, raising its SBC record to 6-4.  FIU has five games left on the season, with only two at home.

&nbsp;
Feb. 13 - UH 14, FIU 6

After starting the season with consecutive losses to Florida A&M and Central Florida at home, a trip to Hawaii seemed like the perfect remedy to give FIU a well-needed vacation, and a chance to regroup.

Maybe not.

The Golden Panthers got clobbered, 14-6, by the Hawaii Rainbows in the first of a three-game series in Honolulu Feb. 13. It was FIU's (1-5) third straight loss. 

"We had some errors and they hit the ball well. They hit a homerun and had a bunch of doubles. We just didn't hit the ball well," said FIU shortstop Luis Rivera.

By the seventh inning, Hawaii was already up 10-0 after scoring seven runs on eight hits off FIU starter Mark Worrell, whose record fell to 0-3 since joining the Golden Panthers this season.

Ammer Cabrera relieved Worrell in the fifth inning, but allowed another seven runs. Cabrera left the game with FIU trailing 14-1.

The Golden Panther offense finally got going with five runs in the ninth, capped by a Dennis Diaz inside-the-park-homerun, but by then it was too late.

Edgar Ramirez pitched a scoreless ninth for FIU in relief of Cabrera.

	Feb. 14 - UH 5, FIU 4

The Golden Panthers would have loved to get back on the winning track, but their Valentine's Day dates, the Hawaii Rainbows, stole the show.

The Rainbows scored on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth inning to earn a 5-4 victory, handing FIU (1-6) its fourth straight loss.

FIU led by two runs entering the bottom of the ninth, but pitcher Derek DeCarlo ran into trouble. He allowed a bunt single, which turned into a two-bagger after a wild throw by  Rivera. DeCarlo then allowed a double to tie the game at four, followed by a pair of walks, before Hawaii first baseman Andrew Sansaver brought home catcher Matthew Inouye for the game-winner on a pop-up to left. 

FIU held a 3-1 lead in the fourth inning, when third baseman P.J. Lehmann started off with a single through the left side and designated hitter Jeff Skellenger reached base on an error. Catcher Adrian Casanova followed with a two-run double to right field, giving FIU a 2-1 lead. Right fielder Brian Aragon added an RBI single, putting FIU up two runs.

Before FIU could extend its lead any further, starter Andrew Edwards allowed a solo homerun to Hawaii's designated hitter Nathan Thurber, trimming the Golden Panthers' lead to 3-2. After issuing a pair of walks, Edwards was charged for another run after being replaced by Danny Hernandez, who allowed an RBI single to Inouye, tying the game at three.

Lehmann added some insurance with an RBI single in the top of the ninth, before FIU's bullpen faltered. Lehmann finished the game 2 for 5 with a run scored and improved his average to .368 on the season.

DeCarlo (0-2) has now lost his first two games in 2004 after compiling a 17-0 record over his first two years at FIU.

Feb. 15 - UH 7, FIU 3

The Rainbows completed the sweep, with a convincing 7-3 victory over FIU Feb. 15. 

Sophomore Brian Aragon gave FIU a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning with a two-run homer to right, his first of the season.

But again, FIU could not hold onto the lead. Pitcher Jon Banke allowed a three-run homer to Thurber, and Hawaii led 5-3 after four innings.

"I made a mistake. I hung a splitter and the guy dropped the bat head on it and put it out of the park. One pitch can turn the whole game around," Banke said.

Hawaii (4-5) tacked on two more runs off FIU pitcher Derek Antelo as FIU added only one run on an RBI groundout by Lehmann in the seventh.

"We didn't hit well the first game, but the second two games we hit well, but they caught everything we hit," Rivera said.

Rivera (1-5) extended his hitting streak to eight games after he doubled to left field in the seventh.  

Banke (0-1) took the loss for FIU, dropping the team to 1-7 on the season.

"We're in a bad stretch right now. We feel like the ball is not bouncing our way. We're not catching any breaks," Banke said. "We feel like we have been playing better baseball, but we just gotta keep on working. We're confident things are gonna get turned around."

FDA delays morning-after pill decision

The Food and Drug Administration told Barr Laboratories, the marketer of a so-called morning-after pill, yesterday that it was delaying its decision on whether to allow the drug to be sold over the counter.  

The agency has asked Barr Laboratories for more information about the emergency contraceptive, also known as Plan B, especially among teenagers, the company said. Plan B, to be taken when regular contraception fails or is skipped, is available by prescription. 

The drug's opponents, which include some members of Congress, have objected to the application to sell it over the counter, arguing that that would encourage promiscuity and risky sex among younger people. 

The drug's advocates reacted with trepidation, recalling that, all along, the application to sell the pill was, above all, political and emotional. They feared that the agency was responding to pressure from conservatives, who oppose making Plan B readily available. 



Dean abandons race, Kerry denies affair

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean officially dropped out of the presential race Wendnesday, following a third place finish in Tuesday's Wisconsin primaries. Dean, who was once the front runner, failed to win a single state in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. 

The current front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, faced allegations of an affair. A woman linked romantically by apparently baseless Internet and tabloid rumors to Kerry denied on Monday that she ever had any personal relationship with him.

Kerry denied the rumor Friday, a day after it first broke on the Drudge Report Web page of cyber-gossip Matt Drudge. 

"I just deny it categorically," said Kerry, who's been married since 1995 to Teresa Heinz Kerry, his second wife. "It's rumor. It's untrue, period."

Headline: New Sandler film 50 First Dates proves to be hopelessly romantic
Author: Krystal Alvarez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The morning after has never been so awkward. In the new Happy Madison production "50 First Dates," there is a look into the wonderful world of short-term memory lost. OK, so we all have wanted to forget one fling or another but for Lucy (Drew Barrymore), she really can't remember.  Because of a car accident, Lucy's short-term memory disorder leaves us with an unlikely conquest for the loveable commitment-a-phobic playboy, Henry Roth (Adam Sandler).

Set in Hawaii, the movie puts people in the mood for romance with camera shots of beautiful mountains, peaceful oceans and the usual light-hearted poke at what else: Hawaiian culture. Rob Schneider, who has been in most of Sandler's films, plays a stereotypical island loser with a slew of talented children. The disgusting jokes made by Schneider are quickly followed by the cute antics of the Hawaiian tots. However, the children aren't the only hint of cuteness in the movie. There is a cuddly penguin that is Sandler's pet and a very promiscuous walrus that makes way for a lot of sex jokes. Needless to say, there are cheap animal tricks and one nasty encounter with superfluous walrus vomit. No need to spoil that joke for you. 

Like most Sandler movies, the film takes the audience on a wacky ride full of unexpected jokes but just like in "The Wedding Singer," there is a lot of romance. "50 First Dates" is saturated with humor, but the lovey-dovey stuff is corny and very prevalent.  Henry attempts to make Lucy fall in love with him all over again before the day is over. Insert an "awww" here. Plus, the techniques he uses to sway her lovin' will have girlfriends everywhere wondering "Why can't anyone do that for me?"  	

"50 First Dates" has its funny moments, along with its devastatingly predictable Sandler jokes. It is definitely worth watching. By far, it is a good film for those who want to get nookie on a date, but a definitely a no-no for those who are bitterly single. Do not watch it alone if you are not ready to cry, is the main case and point. For those of you who are the unromantic type, you can simply fantasize about a woman you can have some fun with and then she won't remember your name the next day.  I guess there's a little bit of something for everyone in this flick, the hopeless romantics, the slapstick comedy lovers and the incredibly insensitive pigs.

Headline: WB cancels long-lived 'Angel' in midst of show's glory
Author: Kate O’Hare / Knight Ridder Tribune

LOS ANGELES - An announcement was made to the cast and crew Friday at The WB's "Angel" that this season, the show's fifth, would be its last.

"It's official enough to know it's real," David Greenwalt, who co-created the series with Joss Whedon, tells Zap2it.com, "but I haven't talked to anybody at the network or the studio. I can tell you that it's real, that it makes Mr. Whedon and myself very sad, that we wish it had kept going and we thought it was only getting better.

"Joss and (executive producer) Jeff Bell told the cast and crew today, We have no understanding of the inner workings of the corporate world, but we've had a long and fruitful relationship with (producing studio) 20th Century Fox and The WB, for which we grateful. We just wish it could have gone on forever. Apparently, it's not going to.

"Joss literally called me this morning, so it's very new."

This news comes on the heels of airing the 100th episode of the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" spin-off, the taping of which was marked by a party on the show's sets last November.

At that time, the WB's entertainment chief, Jordan Levin, said, "The work that you all do, I cannot thank you enough. This is something that will last. You can see it in the DVD sales. You see it in the fans. They give an incredible amount of attention to almost everything.

"You've created a cult here, and it's pretty wonderful to be a part of it. So thank you and congratulations."

On Wednesday, "Angel" aired one of its most innovative episodes, called "Smile Time." 

Written and directed by Ben Edlund ("The Tick"), and based on an idea by Whedon, it saw the show's title character, a crusading vampire with a soul, forced to fight evil after being transformed into a walking puppet (with voice by series star David Boreanaz).

"It's so brilliant," Greenwalt says. "I just love it. It's one of the finest pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen. It just cracked me up. It's so ridiculous and silly, and yet there's all this heartfelt stuff in it. It's just quintessential Whedon.

"But wait until you see the episode that follows it in terms of abject heartbreak. It's just searing."

Greenwalt stepped away from "Angel" a few years ago but has remained a consulting producer. Since then, he's worked on two short-lived but critically acclaimed series, ABC's "Miracles" and UPN's "Jake 2.0." But he's contemplating a possible return to his old stomping ground.

"I might just go direct episode 20 (of 'Angel')," he says, "so I can say my farewell to everybody. That's something that might happen."

As of press time, The WB had made no official announcement.
