A friend recently responded to this article in the Beacon.  His name is LTC Don Barnett.  He is an Active Duty Army officer who writes of that which he knows unlike the author of the article. Yet you have chosen to silence the other point of view by not publishing his letter to the editor.  As a recent graduate of FIU (May'05) that saddens and disgusts me. If this is your choice of publication then at least have the decency to rename your self a "biased opinionpaper" and not a "newspaper".
So much for the university tradition of an exchange of ideas.  But all is not lost-up until now I had no idea what I would use to line my cat's litter box.

Headline: Endangered species bill no good
Author: Ben Badger / Webmaster
&nbsp;
Throughout the known history of mankind's growth and expansion, there has always been one common factor - nature eventually suffers. The extent of the suffering has varied tremendously. 

In the 1970's, a landmark act was passed which greatly increased the amount of protection for both endangered animal and plant species. It was the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

The Act is credited for helping save the bald eagle from extinction, among many others. All in all, the act was a very good thing. Yet, for the greedy developers in our country, it was a constant hindrance. So it was no surprise that the House of Representatives by a vote of 229 to 193, passed new legislation to have the entire act reevaluated. In other words, make the act much weaker than it is.

The new bill was pushed through by the chairman of the House Resources Committee, GOP Rep. Richard Pombo. Pombo's bill would require the government to compensate developers if steps needed to protect species under the Endangered Species Act thwarted development plans and would make political appointees responsible for scientific determinations. 

But the biggest crunch is that it would stop the government from designating critical habitats. Critical habitats are just what they sound like, areas that are critical to survival of species and thus protected. I believe all these new changes are just going to make the 1973 Act useless. I mean what is the point? 

"You've got to pay when you take away somebody's private property. That is what we have to do," Pombo told House colleagues.

That statement pretty much states that Pombo, who is a California rancher, must have had some bad run-ins with the act. So, naturally, when a powerful politician runs into a law that is unbeneficial to him, said politician must go out and make it beneficial. Why cant this situation ever happen in reverse? I don't know of  any politician going out and making laws that are not exclusively beneficial to them. Now, there are two big issues I believe will result from Pombo's bill. 

One, the bill will eliminate important protection to species and, two, will open the door for large government payouts to property owners. And by sheer coincidence, many democrats and some moderate republicans, have the same trail of thought as me, according to an article on cnn.com.

The bill sets a "dangerous precedent that private individuals must be paid to comply with an environmental law," said House representative of West Virginia Nick Rahall, the committee's top democrat.

 I can see it now. A developer is low on funds and they happen to be right next door to a wildlife preserve. 

It's as if the property owner would say, "Hey, if I say I need to build up my property into the wildlife reserve, the government will have to pay me lots of money to not do so." This is going to happen so often it scares me if Pombo's bill has the same results it did in the Senate as it did with the House. As of right now, the bill's rewrite faces an unknown future in the Senate.

"What's next? Paying citizens to wear seat belts? ... This bill will not improve species' ability to recover," said Rahall. I really like this guy. He has the rare gift to say things that actually make total logical and common sense. A trait that is fleeting in most politicians.

Another big pickle is the obvious financial implications the bill could have. The congressional budget office suggests that the total cost each year for the bill would be less than $20 million a year in payouts to developers, while opponents of the bill suggest it will be substantially higher. I am inclined to believe the opponent for one logical reason; $20 million is about nothing today to big business.  I bet most government agencies spend more on post - its.

Its no secret that this country owes a lot of money to many different countries. In order to decrease the debt, certain benefits citizens have been entitled to for decades have been lessened or eliminated. 

Social Security is down, the retirement age is forever going up. Countless other services in this country are disappearing. I understand most cuts. When taking a first look, they seem to be doing the job. After all, we go back and forth between surplus and deficit all the time.

But this incredibly asinine bill does no one, other than greedy developers, any good. Why do the American people have to suffer so many cut-backs just to pay for some frivolous bill? I can't see why they should or why we should.

It's sad that the rich and mighty of our government continue to push laws that only help them and hurt the average citizen. Not to mention the countless species that can't protect themselves. 

The number of people who care are in a quick decline. It's getting harder and harder to pass laws that really protect the environment and citizens. 

Susan Holmes, senior legislative representative at Earthjustice, said the bill basically amounted to "the death warrant for treasured American wildlife. If the Senate fails to do the right thing and reject this bill, America stands to lose hundreds of species of rare plants and animals," she said.

One last thing to consider, an alternative to Pombo's bill, which would have strengthened recovery plans for endangered species, eliminated payments to landowners for blocked developments and created a scientific advisory board to assist the interior secretary failed by 216 votes to 206.

Headline: Love of Art
Subheadline: Self-expression with no boundaries is true art
Author: Paul Benavides / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"An artist arranges lines and colors on a surface in some interesting way." 


A few nights ago, a friendly get together with friends at an art opening turned into a broad and frustrated discussion about "art."

I enjoy the topic, but I have trouble putting my thoughts together on-the-spot. So, let me take this opportunity to organize my thoughts about what art is to me and how it fits into the world as I know it.

Art can span from movie-making to religous celebration and from professional wrestling to yoga.  

Yes, this is very broad. Art crosses the boundaries of all these occupations of life, so it resembles a philosophy.  While philosophy concentrates on consciousness of reality, it grows from our emotions.  

Thus, I believe our emotions, at any stage, are at the root of art and perhaps the essence of all social functions. Ask yourself: Why does the wrestler fly off the top rope? Why does the pilgrim make the journey?



"All works of art function, to some extent, as avenues of personal expression for the artist."


Self-expression is the key here, the proverbial keystone that is holding the arch of our art world together.  

You might ask if this applies to everything that we do. Yup, it sure does.  My definition implies that everything we do is art, including  everything we make. Before we start heading into philosophical territory let us go back to last night at the exhibition, now that we have some idea of my definition of art.



"Art continues to satisfy our individual needs for personal expression."
  

So there I was, surrounded by the works of around 50 different artists in a gallery that also operated as the artists' studios. It was quite an ingenious and revealing environment. I was excited to see all the work, the variety of styles and techniques and ideas. I met up with a fellow artist-friend, whom I share very similar artistic tastes with. He  led me to an exhibition room with works he described as somewhat upsetting. Now, this is where I take a different point of view than my friend and some of my close contemporaries.



"Contempt and Love for the Artist"


As I examined closely the "upseting" work, I noticed that it was not the subject of the work that was upsetting to my friend, but rather the context of the situation. I can sympathize with these feelings.  

What was happening felt like jealousy and contempt.  

My friend has been to some of Europe's finest galleries and museums, in rooms filled with the world's finest pieces of art. 

He believes that these pieces have earned their place in history as works of genius. They represent humanity at its apex.  

So, you can imagine, when he comes to see this exhibit down here in Miami's design district, he is dumb-founded to see work hanging on the walls - just like the masters' works hang in the Louvre- that fail to match the  gloriousness and profound catharsis of the world's finest.  Yes, I've felt this way too. 

Where my friend would feel contempt for the artist, for having failed to live up to, or at least try to match, the greatness of Dali, Picasso or VanGogh,  I feel contempt for the industry.



"Art as Industry"
	

My definition of  art is not compatible with modern society's definition of it, which is limited self-expression, censored by society's fears and anxieties, and bound to the fate of the established economic system. Let's apply this definition to the night at the exhibition. 

As I walked through the gallery admiring the art (no longer bothered by the frustrated, academic or technical level of achievement), I finally understood that the work presented before me was not a representation of the fundamental desire to glorify our masters/teachers, but the result of self-expression that has been pressured and suffocated by the powers of social persuasion and market forces.  

These factors are elements of the free-market system. Still, the important element of emotional development exists, but atrophied by the wave of commercialism. Ask yourself, did these artists earned the privilege of gallery space or did they just pay for it?



"Outsider Art/ Underground Art"


I failed to eloquently describe my theory to my friend who, like other contemporaries of mine, was upset to see such unsatisfying work hanging on the walls like VanGogh does at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The price tags compounded the frustration and continued to be dissapointed with the artist for having failed to properly represent the honorable integrity of a master.  

We started to divert the discussion towards the characteristics of a master, such as his desires or psychological  health. We then talked about the dangers of criminal art (such as erotic art or black metal) and then landed into outsider art. 

Now, I place importance here because it is part of my view of modern society's definition of art and its illegitimate offspring which is underground/outsider art.  As I stress the importance of emotional development as the root of art, modern society's art, which has restricted our emotional freedom, has given birth to an outcast artist who prides himself on isolation, alienation or self-destruction.  

If the art industry continues in its direction, we will have many frustrated and marginalized artists upset that the free-market society has slighted them.

It's true that there are many wonderful stories in the art world. My friend mentioned how DaVinci developed from a troubled youth and Joe Coleman found fame through his over-compulsive and grotesque work.  However, what about that artist that never makes the books, magazines or even the gallery?  

Does one not deserve to have a gallery show?  My belief is, since every human being has the desire for self-expression, everyone should be entitled to embody and assume the role of the artist, to carry on that tradition which has sprung from the masters, those who have inspired us and shown us that our emotions have no bounds!  

We should not have contempt for the artist, but rather have great skepticism  for the system which casts a shadow on his/her canvas.

Headline: Protesters fast in GC for Cuban prisoners
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
On Oct. 4, 41 different universities worldwide, including FIU, joined together for "Fast for Freedom." Students involved fasted from 11 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. in front of the Graham Center pit. 

Dozens of students joined in for the cause, holding flyers and posters with the faces of Victor Rolando Arroyo, an independent journalist, and Felix Navarro Rodriguez, a civil rights movement leader in Cuba.

Both men were arrested in March 2003 after speaking out on freedom of speech, press and human rights on the island of Cuba. Senior Veronica Nur Valdez experienced an awakening when she found out about the drastic political problems occurring in Cuba. 

She found a role in Cuban history and wants to share her role with the university community. 

"We're protesting because everyone should know what's going on. This is just one day of fasting, it won't be the last," said Valdez. "We can't compete against [organizations giving away] free towels. God forbid us for trying to save lives."

On Sept. 10, Arroyo declared himself to be on a hunger strike and Rodriguez joined him  three days later.

Students are not the only ones fasting for the cause. The men's families will also be fasting until their basic rights are returned.

The families will also not rest until the men are moved to prisons in provinces where they live, according to Diana Cabrera, member of the directory for Cuban democracy. Both families plan on traveling together in order to visit with the prisoners.

"We have done a phone campaign to officials nationwide. We won't stop until the world knows about the injustices in Cuba," Cabrera said. "The community will come together to speak for those who are silenced and act for those who are restrained."

The Cuban government separated both prisoners, sending Arroyo to the Cuban province of Holguin and Rodriguez to Granma.

According to Cabrera, both men are severely dehydrated and are renouncing any type of medical attention. 

Even though "Fast for Freedom" was supposed to only bring awareness to the injustice occurring in Cuba, FIU students did seem to realize the importance of what is being done.

"I am so glad to have witnessed this group of people. I had no idea what was going on in reality and I hope to help out in any way I can," said junior Maria Octales. "I would like to learn more and talk about the incident in some of my classes."

Headline: University competes at solar decathlon
Author: Andrew Leins / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With most of the United States beginning to face an energy crisis, the race is on to develop alternative means of powering homes and machines. A team of FIU students and professors are at the forefront of that race. 

For more than two years, students from the School of Architecture, the College of Engineering and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, have all been working together to build a house in which all the electronics and appliances can be powered by solar energy. 

The house was completed and disassembled last week for shipment to Washington, D.C. for the Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon Competition. 

"It's pretty amazing being here at the National Mall in D.C., You have the Capitol Building on one side and the Washington Monument down on the other," said team leader Robert Perez, who majored in architecture and graduated last semester. "I couldn't leave the project even after graduating."  

This is the culmination of all the students' hard work and it still isn't finished. The team is still putting the finishing touches on the house. 

"The house was damaged a little bit during the shipping to Washington but it was mainly cosmetic," Perez said. "The pressure is on because like any construction project, there are inspections and everything has to be according to the guidelines set forth by the Department of Energy. We've all been working 16 hours a day. We get up at six, get to the site by seven and work until about 11. There are currently 12 students working at the site. We're all a little stressed but everyone is in good spirits."  

There were some concerns for the team with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but luckily, the houses sustained no major damage. 

"One of the things we're most proud of is that this house withstood three hurricanes," said Faculty co-leader Nathaniel Belcher. 

The house was made with special steel beams made donated by Bobek Building Systems. 

"The steel beams are made to withstand category five winds," said Ryan Moreno, team member majoring in mechanical engineering. The house also has a new high tech cooling system which expends little energy, while providing a high level of cooling. It works on a motion sensor, so depending on the volume of people in a room of the house, the system sends more cooling to where it is most needed. "This helps cut down on energy waste," Ryan said.

FIU enters this competition as a bit of an underdog against some very prominent schools like Cornell, the University of Michigan and California Polytechnic University. 

"Most of these universities have large endowments and funds from which to draw money while we had to basically beg for sponsors," said Faculty Project Leader Yong X. Tao. 

Most of the $350,000 cost of the project was provided by private sponsors, more than 60 in total. 

"It was tough in the beginning because we had to go and look for sponsors, meanwhile, we had no design to show them," Perez said. 

The houses will be on display at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., they are calling it the Solar Village. 

The viewing will run from Oct. 7-16, and the houses will be judged in 10 different categories including architecture and energy balance. 

The competition is expected to be visited by congressmen and government officials. A documentary is being made on the event for the Do-It Yourself (DIY) TV network. 

The Solar Decathlon is sponsored by the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  

"The Department of Energy decided to start this competition and put the designs into the hands of the students. The faculty staff are merely advisors, all the work and design was put in by the students," said Tao. "This project has been very time consuming, with all the planning and testing, but it has been a great experience for me and especially the students. This was a great learning experience for everyone involved."

Headline: FAMU unable to capitalize on shaky Golden Panther defense
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
Despite coming off two straight victories, Florida A&M (2-3) had no answers for FIU (1-3) in a 23-6 Golden Panther rout.

Former University of Miami All-American and 12-year NFL veteran Rubin Carter, did not have a happy homecoming as his team was unable to capitalize on a FIU defensive unit that came into the game allowing 519.3 yards and 52.3 points per game.

"It was not a very good day for us," Carter said. "I thought we played mediocre. We did not come out with a lot of intensity and gave away some easy scores."

Carter used three quarterbacks in the game, with redshirt freshman Chris Owens making his third straight start at quarterback, due to Josh Driscoll's groin injury, suffered in the first game of the season. With a little over three minutes left in the first half, Carter inserted 5-foot-6, 170-pound Leon Camal and early in the fourth, Albert Chester came into the game.

"We had to send out a young player who is not very experienced," Carter said of Owens, who finished the game 5-of-9 for 29 yards and an interception.

After the game, FIU head coach Don Strock had plenty of praise for first-year coach Carter.

"He's done a tremendous job in the time he has been up there and there's some talent on that team," Strock said. "In a couple of years, they will be a force to reckon with."

FIU running back Ben West started in place of Julian Reams, who sat out the game with a neck stinger. West rushed 34 times for 214 yards. With a wet and slippery field, Strock ran the ball often.

"We always try to establish the run and under these conditions you definitely are," Strock said. "I held my breath every time we handed off the ball and Ben did a tremendous job hanging on to it."

There were several defensive changes for FIU. Defensive ends Kevin Akinbiyi and Myron Acoff, both of whom started against Arkansas State, were replaced. Linebacker Antwan Barnes, who came into the game leading the team with 3.5 sacks and picked up two more in the game, started at left defensive end. Shaun Dudney started at right defensive end and freshman defensive lineman Jonas Murrell took over for Jarvis Penerton at tackle. FIU rotated 12 defensive linemen into the game.

Strock knows Barnes may not like it.

"He's sit, great speed and got to the quarterback a few times. He may not like to be there, but he has no choice now and he knows he has to listen to me so it doesn't matter," Strock said.

Barnes credited practice to why he was effective against FAMU.

"The past week all we did was toughen up. I practiced at [defensive end] all week and I adapted well," Barnes said. "I used my speed to attack the pass rush."


Key points


* FAMU punter Wesley Taylor struggled early on in the game punting, but in the third quarter, as wind and rain went in FAMU's favor moving east to west, Wesley kicked an 82-yard punt. However, that was 7 yards short of a school record set in 1972 by Tyron Williams. On the next possession, FIU punter Chris Patullo launched the ball against the wind for only 13 yards. Taylor punted nine times, one short of a school record.

* FIU receiver Cory McKinney continued his receptions streak, catching three passes for 75 yards and a touchdown and has caught a pass in every game since the inaugural season.

* An announced attendance of 16,512, second highest at FIU Community Stadium, was on hand to see the Golden Panthers' first win in two years at the stadium. Last season's home victory, a 40-23 win over FAMU in the Orange Blossom Classic, was at the Orange Bowl.

* After eight years, the OBC returned to Miami last year and again for this game. FAMU has played in every game and holds a 43-25-1 lead in the series.

Headline: Scudeler, Coleman lead team on historic weekend
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's men's soccer team kicked off its first games in Conference USA with a bang, tying Kentucky 1-1 on Sept. 30 before exploding offensively for a 7-0 rout of Marshall on Oct. 2.

Senior Lucas Scudeler played all 110 minutes in the Golden Panthers' grudge match against the Wildcats, scoring the lone FIU goal. 

Two days later, freshman Levi Coleman boosted the Panthers, earning a hat trick and adding an assist in FIU's win against the Thundering Herd.  

FIU improved its record to 5-3-1 (1-0-1 in C-USA) and awaits a major challenge in its next game. 

On Oct. 8, FIU will host cross-state rival Central Florida in a rematch of the 2004 NCAA first round, won by UCF 1-0. 

The game begins at 7 p.m. at the University Park Soccer Stadium.



FIU 1, Kentucky 1



The Golden Panthers came home from California to a season-high 611 fans in attendance for its inaugural C-USA game against Kentucky. FIU hammered the Wildcats with 35 shots and 17 corner kicks, but settled for a 1-1 tie.

Heeding the yells of vocal goalkeeper Shawn Crowe, FIU played aggressively throughout the match, despite yielding a goal to Kentucky defender Brandon Stewart in the 26th minute. 

The Golden Panthers applied constant pressure in the first period. Yet Kentucky goalkeeper Andy Gruenebaum and the Wildcats' prevent defense, in which nine players crowed the box at all times, halted FIU's momentum going into intermission. 

"It is very, very difficult to play against a team that is absolutely committed not to letting you play," said head coach Karl Kremser. "They got the first goal and they protected it at all costs."

Kremser made a halftime adjustment, adding Danny Vazquez as the third member of the frontline. 

It paid off as the Golden Panthers outshot Kentucky 19-2 in the second period.

Midfielder Lucas Scudeler ended FIU's 259-minute scoring drought at 69:42, scoring on a penalty shot to tie the score. 

The Brazilian senior celebrated by sprinting to the sideline and hugging former teammate Fernando Plentz.

"For three years, me and Fernando had tried to celebrate. And now that he's gone, I saw him on the sideline," Scudeler said, "That's why I came here. So I felt really good to help my team."

Scudeler led FIU with 11 shots on the night, but it was junior forward David Hope who came closest to clinching a victory for the team.  

With eight minutes remaining in regulation, Hope headed a ball near the goal line that was juggled by Gruenebaum on the ground. 

Hope celebrated but officials ruled that he did not score.

"That was a goal," Hope said after the game. "It was over the line and the linesman said that the keeper blocked it so he couldn't see it."

FIU continued to dictate play in the two 10-minute overtime periods, outshooting Kentucky 7-1 before the game ended as a tie.

For co-captain Jared Rose, it was a moral victory to be part of the team's hard-fought effort.

"I saw a lot of fight. We came out and we were playing really well. We dominated the game," the senior midfielder said. "There was a totally different atmosphere when we came out tonight."



FIU 7, Marshall 0



Levi Coleman recorded a hat trick and four other Golden Panthers scored as FIU routed Marshall 7-0 Sunday afternoon. FIU's seven goals against the Thundering Herd were the most for a Golden Panthers' men's soccer team since FIU beat Alabama A & M 8-0 on Nov. 2, 1997.  

Senior forward Carron Williams got FIU on the board quickly with his seventh goal of the season. At 2:09, Williams broke away from the Marshall defense and took a Lucas Scudeler pass in stride before kicking the ball into the right side of the goal.  

The leading scorer in Conference USA, Williams had managed only one shot in the preceding three games against constant double coverage.

"There's some weight off my shoulders now," said Williams. "I hope I can score some more."

In the 37th minute, after an errant header by Marshall, sophomore Danny Vazquez controlled the ball, eluded the defense, baited Marshall goalie Greg Terhune out of the box and scored into the open goal.

"I was an animal," said a smiling Vazquez. "I had two on me the whole time and I just went 'what?' "

With FIU holding a 3-0 lead, the second half turned into the Levi Coleman show.  The freshman forward from Oklahoma fired his first goal in at 53:04 after successive passes by Scudeler and Vazquez.

Coleman showed a nice touch on FIU's fifth goal with a smooth crosspass onto the foot of a diving Chris Andaur in the 61st minute. Andaur pushed the ball into the right side of the net for the first goal of his collegiate career.

Edgard Correa's corner kick in the 81st minute led to Coleman's second goal of the day, a header from the near side.

"I told Edgard to put it at the corner of the six," said Coleman. "He put it right there perfect, so I appreciate it and I give him thanks for that. It was a good ball."

Correa must have enjoyed the gratitude because it was only four minutes later that he found Coleman wide open to ensure the freshman's first career hat trick.

"I think the heat wore them down so we were able to have as much time as we wanted," Coleman said. "It came natural, almost."

Goalkeeper Shawn Crowe earned the fifth shutout of his career and was named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Week on Oct. 3.

FIU now readies itself for an NCAA tournament rematch against new conference foe UCF. For seniors on the team like Carron Williams, it is a moment they've long been anticipating.

"I can't wait," Williams said. "That was a hard loss we took, when we lost to them 1-0, but we're going to have them and we're going to beat them."

Headline: West rushes for career best in football's first victory of season
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The rain came down in the early evening Oct. 1 at FIU Community Stadium and so did the three game losing streak. 

In an almost hurricane-like deluge,  FIU 1-3, 0-1 SBC took care of Division I-AA Florida A&M 2-3 in the annual Orange Blossom Classic, 23-6. 

FIU's running game came alive through backup tailback Ben West, who took over for an injured Julian Reams, rushing for a career best 224 yards on 34 carries. 

The 224 yards were third-most in school history behind two performances by former tailback Rashod Smith.  

Quarterback Josh Padrick was mistake-free, predominantly in the first half, completing 15-of-23 passes for 226 and two scores. 

West was great from the beginning in his first career start. The sophomore, who was not redshirted last season as Julian Reams was said to be the feature back, stepped in and proved he deserved to have a shot at the job. 

In the first half, which was dominated by FIU throwing the ball before the rain started and in which Padrick accumulated most of his yards, West rushed 17 times for 106 yards, reaching the goal West had set for himself. 

"We ran the ball effectively and made first downs," said head coach Don Strock following the win. "Ben West did a tremendous job hanging onto the football in very poor weather conditions."

He did not stop in the second half and on the same amount of carries gained 118 yards.

 Apart from West, the story of the day was the rain. In what appeared to be monsoon-like conditions, the Astroplay field looked more like a swamp in the second half and that drastically changed the outlook of play. Neither team was able to pass the ball, so the team with the better running game took over.

FIU, who once again struggled inside the red zone for the fourth week in a row, did manage three field goals by kicker Adam Moss.

Moss connected from 24 yards in the first half as well as 26 and 37 yards in the second. 

Chandler Williams led all receivers with five catches for 122 yards as well as showing his astonishing pace in catching one of the two Padrick touchdowns during a 58 yard connection.  

The host Golden Panthers dominated on both sides of the ball as they held the Rattlers to just 154 net yards. FIU's defense stifled the visitors all afternoon, who in turn put three different play callers behind center and were only highlighted by a 77-yard touchdown with little at stake in the fourth quarter. 

Coach Strock reaffirmed the defenses play after struggling the past couple of weeks. 

"Other than that, one play where we thought the receiver was knocked out of bounds [in reference to the 77-yard touchdown], our defense did a tremendous job, got a bunch of sacks and kept pressuring the quarterback. They couldn't throw the ball downfield and we stopped their running game. Overall, the defense really stepped up to the table," Strock said.

FIU's defense managed four sacks and two interceptions en route to holding the Rattlers to an FIU season-low six points. Keyonvis Bouie and Lion Singleton both intercepted passes in the win. Antwan Barnes played at defensive end from his usual linebacker position. Brandon Higdon and Jarvi Penerton all sacked Rattler quarterbacks. 

The Golden Panthers started the game on the right foot. On their second drive of the game, Padrick connected with wide out Cory McKinney for a 26 yard completion on third and four, which set up a first and goal from inside the five. Even though they were unable to end their red zone jinx, Moss did come through and put FIU up 3-0 with 6:22 left in the first quarter.

FIU's red zone offense would struggle again later in the first quarter. 

With a first and five from the 19, following a FAMU penalty, FIU was denied a first down four times, including two rushes up the middle - on third-and-inches and fourth-and-inches. Instead of settling for three points, Strock and his staff decided to gamble by putting the ball in the hands of hot tailback West, who was rejected by the FAMU frontline for the only time all afternoon. 

FIU's defense came alive in the second quarter as Bouie intercepted FAMU quarterback Chris Owens.

Though the Golden Panthers were unable to generate much on the following possession and punted, the defense held strong. 

Following a FAMU punt that gave FIU good field position at their own 42 yard line, Padrick connected with Williams for a 58 yard score, the longest of Williams's career. Following the Moss extra-point, Strock's men held a deserving 10-0 lead. 

As the half came to an end, no better finish could have been asked for.

The Golden Panthers took over the ball with two minutes left in the half and executed the two-minute drill perfectly. Padrick found his favorite target Cory McKinney from 20 yards out and the home side took the lead 17-0. 

Starting the drive at their own 26, tailback Ben West, who on the drive went over 100 yards for the day, took over. 

On a critical fourth and eight from the 33-yard line, the coaching staff took a gamble and gave the ball to West, who easily picked up 11 yards up the middle and put his side in perfect scoring position with enough time on the clock for Padrick to find McKinney.  

 Following a deserved rest at the half, FIU came out in the third quarter firing. They were stopped for the third time in the red zone, however by the Rattlers, something they must fix before facing North Texas in two weeks. 

Moss connected for the second time for the day, this time from 27 yards out and put the home side up 20-0. As he kicked off the rain began. 

While the deluge sent many fans home early, the game went on.  

The two teams, forced by the weather to move the football on the ground, traded drives until FAMU caught the Panthers by surprise on the first play of the fourth quarter. 

New quarterback Albert Chester, the third play caller of the day for the Rattlers, found wide out Roosevelt Kiser for a 77-yard touchdown on his first pass attempt down the left sideline. The FIU defense seemed to stop on the plat as it appeared Kiser had stepped out of bounds. Because of the excess water on the field, the extra point was missed. FIU led 20-6. 

FIU would manage their last points on the afternoon following the Penerton interception. 

The ball was returned to the FAMU 38 yard-line. FIU managed to move the ball 18 yards on six plays and with 3:31 remaining in the contest, Moss connected for the longest of his three field goals, this time from 37-yards away. 

FIU saw a crowd of over 16,000 attend the game, a figure which they would like repeated following a bye week as they face four-time defending Sun Belt Conference champions North Texas on Oct. 15.

'Guinea pig' doctor wins Nobel medicine prize

Australian professors Barry Marhsall and Robin Warren were announced as winners of the 2005 Nobel prize in medicine for their 1982 discovery that stomach ulcers are caused by the Helicobacter pylori bacterium and not stress, as had been popularily thought.

However, because their research was often met with skepticism, Marshall took the great leap of swallowing a culture of the bacteria himself, becoming a guinea pig in order to test his theory. Their research eventually managed to disspell the widely-held belief that ulcers are caused by stress, resulting in the development of the antibiotics and drug treatments now used to prevent the illness. 

Australian Prime Minister John Howard congratulated the pair on Oct. 4, and said their work had bought relief to millions of people around the world.

Marshall and Warren, who were working at the royal Perth hospital at the time of their breakthrough, are the first all-Australian team to win the Nobel prize for medicine.

Headline: Fair raises student's career awareness
Author: Stella Junco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Freshman Eddy Zeng was surprised at the number of companies present at this year's Part- Time Job, Volunteer & Internship Fair held at the Biscayne Bay Campus Sept. 28. in the atrium located in Academic I and the first floor of the Wolfe University Center. 

"[I] was looking for a job pertaining to [my] major," Zeng, an electrical engineering major said.

Companies such as FedEx Ground, Regions Bank, MTV Networks Latin America and the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida attended the event and were seeking undergraduate candidates, like Zeng, for employment possibilities.

"This was a unique opportunity for students to find internship positions within a wide selection of fields," said Elliot Sklar, a graduate student and assistant of Career Services.

Not only were students able to obtain part-time jobs and internships, but event organizers also helped with resume critiques, wardrobe suggestions and possible interview questions, according to Manessa Lazar, a student assistant from career services. 

During previous years, a smaller staff organized the event, however, this year's fair involved one of its largest teams and a higher number of registered corporations attended, according to the career services department.

Although employers are seeking student recruits, the attending corporations hold education as a student's number one priority.

"They are aware of the value of education and are willing to accommodate," Lazar said. 

Claudia Reich, associate director of student services, agrees.

"One of the primary reasons for this Part Time Job, Volunteer and Internship Fair is for those in search of flexibility," Reich said.

While some companies like UPS offered flexible shifts on different intervals, other stores, like Macy's, wanted workers who would be available for weekend and night shifts. Other employers, including the Broward Sheriff Office, searched for full time candidates, considering its full time opening and only certain hours are available.

 "We try our hardest [to accommodate], but we're not a 24 hour-Walgreens," said Marjorie Weddle, BSO's program coordinator.

But schedule accommodation and hour flexibility was not a consistent factor at the fair, which proved to be troublesome for some students.

Most companies attended the event already having a wealthy number of student employees and searched to increase the figure. 

"75 percent of our workers are presently students; bringing more compelling force to the company," said David Alvarez, a Best Buy recruiting representative.

Most students, like Zeng, increased their knowledge on the workforce.

"[This] event let me know what options I have, at least internship-wise," Zeng said.

Employer contact information for internships was provided and internships were encouraged at the event, which is beneficial for a student's resume. 

"[This] can help students get their foot in the door with several companies," said Danny Doyle, a representative from Big 105.9. 

Although this event was not a formal career fair, it was promoted throughout campus and on the Career Services website because it is only hosted on an annual basis. It was held to broaden a student's awareness of career options.

 "It's imperative that students take advantage of the event, while they walk around campus not paying attention to what's going on until senior year," Reich said. 

Kim Howard, a graduate student and assistant for career services, agrees. 

"If you're a freshman, take advantage," Howard said.

The event was hosted by FIU's Career Services department, in conjunction with the Center for Leadership and Service and the Student Government Council.

For more information, contact BBC Career Services at 305-919-5770 or the Center for Leadership and Service at 305-919-5360.

Headline: New club aims at leadership skills, jobs
Author: Fallan Thompson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Delta Epsilon Iota was created last spring but already boasts over 250 members, most of which are in FIU's Honors College. On their first induction, on May 9, the club already had 120 members and the date was declared "Delta Epsilon Iota Day" by the City of Miami. 

The benefits of Delta Epsilon Iota, which is dedicated to career development, is gaining knowledge and experience in career and leadership development and learning how to create and critique resumes.

 "I believe that our society stands out from the others because it is directly linked to Career Services and that impacts their lives," said Co-advisor Dana DellaCamera. "We help our members get internships and job opportunities."

DellaCamera and Donna Lee, another co-advisor, are working with DEI's president Ana Mauro on this year's scheduled upcoming events, which include bowling with the Special Olympics and attending the White Party that raises AIDS awareness. 

Members can also look forward to working with the Lyse Foundation, Habitat for Humanity and the Shake-A-Leg Foundation, other community service organizations.

 "We're trying to keep a pulse on what the student body wants," DellaCamera said.

Nora Roffe, vice-president of DEI, has lots of plans for the newly created club.

"We are currently collaborating with Student Government Association to create a project called 'Alumni Round Table.'" Roffe said. "This event is being created to help our members network with alumni to obtain job opportunities and share knowledge."

Roffe also plans to create a program called "Shadowing" that will match a freshman with an older classmate to help them decide their major or develop an interest for an area of study.One of DEI's scheduled events was hosting an "Apprentice" style competition where two students each won $1,000 on Sept. 6-8.

"We are the only organization that offers training for real life," DellaCamera said. 

Roffe supports that motto.

"We are dedicated to providing career development opportunities to all majors so that our members can be aware of all that is available in the real world," Roffe said.

The honors society will be recruiting in October and has two requirements: a 3.3 GPA and 38 completed credit hours.

Headline: Sassy girl group blends genres to create unique sound
Author: Ashley Artiles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Starbucks's newest flavor, music-wise, Antigone Rising, is an upcoming band with a mixture of country, classical rock and a hint of pop. 

Never heard on mainstream radio stations or seen on national television, Antigone Rising's, debut album, From the Ground Up, with the help of Starbucks's Hear Music and Lava Records, is punk chicks climbing to the top. 

Lead singer Cassidy's soothing vocals give their music an element of serenity, along with Cathy and Kristen Henderson on the guitars and Jen Zielenbach on the bass. 

In 2004, Antigone Rising opened for Aerosmith and former Black Crowes band member Rich Robinson. 

They have appeared on a Seven Jeans ad campaign, VH1, NBC's "Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and "The Today Show."

This new band from the Northeast played their first gig at their aunt's wedding. 

They continued to play throughout high school and joined the Lilith Fair Tour in 1998. 

In the midst of their journey to stardom, drummer Dena Tauriello joined the foursome and became the missing piece to the puzzle. They were soon given the opportunity by Starbucks's Hear Music, that signed them and presented the band to the public.

Their relaxing music, mostly acoustic, is a symbol of who they are. 

The pungent sound of the electric guitar and bass give their music a country vibe, yet Cassidy's vocals resemble those of Alanis Morrisette and Tori Amos. Drums add a touch of punk rock to the melody and give it a vivacious beat. 

The background music contrasts the vocals, giving this band a unique sound worth listening to. Their first single, "Don't Look Back," was co-written by Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas, adding to the element of serenity. The title of their album, From the Ground Up, gives an insight of these five musicians' aspirations; starting from the bottom and triumphing to the top.

The energetic New Jersey native band is now signed to Lava Records and is ready to conquer and dominate the music industry. 

Antigone Rising has just collaborated with Steven Tyler; Cassidy joined him on vocals with "Walk This Way." 

They are on fire and ready to rock.

Headline: "Mockumentary" touches the heart
Author: Michelle Santisteban / News Page Designer
&nbsp;
Wives for sale! Get one while they last! Yes, I said it, buy a wife. This world has gone to a place I don't really understand. "Mail Order Wife" is a documentary type movie that lets viewers take a peek inside what it's like for most mail order brides when they arrive in the United States. 

"Mail Order Wife" truly gives off the feel of a real documentary, and its cast delivers a realistic and true performance. Adrian Martinez plays an exceptionally foul role and, as nice a guy he might be in real life, hate tends to be the emotion of choice for him in this film.

Eugenia Yuan plays her part well and captures viewers with her intense eyes. As for Andrew Gurland, he comes off as being a better person than Martinez, but turns out to be just as pathetic and sad a character as Martinez. 

Along with the dark humor in the film comes compassion and sympathy for the characters. However, ones' compassion tends to move from character to character and it is genius how the antagonist may be different to some people in the end with a true "left to your own judgment" type of scenario. 

Psychotic rages and creepy movies being filmed in the basement are all elements that add the underground world that lies in "Mail Order Wife."

 Doug Liman, director of "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," "The Bourne Identity" and "Swingers," took a different approach with his film making.

The camera work was pleasing to the eye. Unlike a real documentary, nausea usually kicks in when the camera moves from left to right. 

However, if Liman was aspiring for an authentic looking documentary, perhaps it could have been done a bit more realistically. 

As the winner of Best Independent Feature Film of the 2005 Santa Barbara Film Festival, there is proof of success. However, this "mockumentary," as some are calling it.

Mail order brides are a real thing and absolutely legal. A sort of overcharged dating service, adopt a wife program, cheap love institute. Movies such as "Birthday Girl," starring Nicole Kidman, also bring this idea to the big screen. However, "Mail Order Wife" shows the other side of the business, the more truthful side of it.

If you are into satirical films full of wit, you are in for a treat. However, if you are looking to watch a well mannered and decent documentary on the life of a mail ordered bride, your interest will not be sparked. 

Overall, "Mail Order Wife" satisfies a good movie craving. It shows us that there are bizarre and messed up things going on in the world, and as darkly humorous as it is, the key word is dark. 

Who would have thought that sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction?

Headline: Carnaval to bring latin flavor
Author: Julie Sierra / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Oct. 3-15 is going to be a fun and busy time for FIU students because it's Hispanic Heritage 2005. Sponsored by Student Programming Committee's Hispanic Heritage and concert committee, this year's final hispanic heritage bash will be Carnaval. 

It is going to be held in Lot 7 at the University Park campus, on Saturday, Oct. 15, from 2-6 p.m. and will include performances by Locos Por Juana, Taboo Bambu and Sandy MC. There will also be free food (hispanic of course!) and many give-aways. 

"I'm very excited to see Taboo Bambu and Locos Por Juana. They're one of my favorite bands," said sophmore Sophia Del Zoppo.

SPC hispanic heritage chair, Micaela Ancewicz, expects there will be a big turnout.

"Students from Biscayne Bay and even Pines are coming and Carnaval is also during Parent's Weekend, so we're expecting parents to show up as well," Ancewicz said.

What exactly is going to happen during Carnaval? The first hour will consist of music, free food, party gadgets, giveaways and announcements. Before each artist performs, the stage will have to be set-up, so during that time, something will be going on below - and it will always include free giveaways. During the set-up of the first band, there will be dancers performing to hispanic music. After that, Taboo Bambu will perform for approximately 35 minutes. 

During the stage set-up for the second band, there will be free salsa lessons and giveaways. Then, the band Locos Por Juana will perform. They are bringing along with them most - if not all - of their musicians and instruments. For the third set-up, there will be a second session of free salsa lessons, and then the last band, Sandy MC (formerly known as Sandy & Papo) will perform. By 5:20 p.m. the music part of Carnaval will be over. However, if band members are up to it, there will also be a time for a meet-and-greet and autograph session.

By 5:45 p.m., everyone should be at the Cage for the Panther's second football home game. FIU will face North Texas. 

During half-time, the audience will have an opportunity to show off their natural or newly acquired salsa skills by going down to the middle of the Cage and dancing. 

SPC's main concern about Carnaval is that FIU students and guests have a good time, enjoying the festivity of hispanic music and food.

"I want it to be one of those events no one forgets, because of how great it was," Micaela said. 

Students are looking forward to the event. 

"Just come and see it for yourself; bring the Latin in you," said junior Rene Sanabria.

Subheadline: Beauty pageant raises money for Hurricane Katrina victims
Author: Sarah Madkour / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In the wake of one of the largest natural disasters to hit North America, hurricane Katrina has made our nation come together in order to help the survivors of tragedy. The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) hosted the second annual Shades of Beauty Pageant, in the  Graham Center Ballrooms at University Park  campus, in order to raise money for the thousands of Katrina victims in Biloxi, Miss. 

Kimberly Clarke, now an FIU alumna, started the pageant last year in order to raise money for the crisis in Sudan. Returning as one of the seven judges, she was excited to see how the pageant would turn out, with a new group of students in charge. 

"I was stressed out last year, now I get to just relax," Clarke said.

Nine students joined the pageant, each with one main goal in common, to have fun.

Judges based their voting on the students' personality, inner beauty as well as confidence, evening wear, swimsuit and talent. 

The pageant started off with a skit performed by the different fraternities and sororities present. 

When asked in the video segment of the pageant, "What does NPHC mean to you?" Alicia Pierre answered, "If you don't know your history, it's like a tree without its roots." 

Phi Beta Sigma's FIU chapter was established in 1978. It was the first black greek chapter, which lead to the founding of the National Pan-Hellenic Council. 

"NPHC promotes interaction through forum, meetings and other mediums for the exchange of information and engages in cooperative programming through activities and functions. As well as serving as the official coordination body for nine historically Black Greek-Lettered organizations," said a NPHC spokesperson about what the organization stand for.  

Hosts King Ramone Fluellen and Kim Pearson both added comedy as well as guidance throughout the pageant.  

 The talent portion of the pageant was the main event.  

Contestants did everything from a monologue, from the movie "John Q," to reading a poem and even playing the piano and singing, such as Michael Long Jr. did.

However, with all the different contestants showing off their charisma, there was also entertainment by the Golden Panther Dazzlers, and even a runway show by Mystic Models. 

Not only did the NPHC raise money for victims of the hurricane, the winners of the pageant won $500 in scholarship money.  

Last year's King and Queen, Ramone Fluellen and Larissa Lockett, had the honor of crowning Cierra Browne as this year's Queen, and Michael Long Jr. as King of the Shades of Beauty Pageant.

Wearing a beautiful pink gown, Cierra Browne seemed a perfect queen to fill the shoes of last year's winner. When asked "What is beautiful to you?" She replied with, "Honesty and confidence makes people beautiful."  She held those attributes as she sang a capella "I Won't Complain," her mother's favorite song.  

A wonderful night full of laughter, thanks to Russell Jacques and music by DJ Stunna and Cash Money, and to all the fraternities and sororities that participated.
