Headline: University violates law
Subheadline: State, FIU administrators point fingers; inspection certificates go missing
Author: Alejandra Diaz /  Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Unposted inspection certificates in campus elevators - a violation of state law - have left some students and faculty members concerned about the safety of campus elevators, but administrators cite recently updated inspection reports and changing laws as proof of safety. 

State officials confirm that certificates must be posted in all elevator cars, however, they admit that due to recent changes in the management of elevator inspections and certification, they are having trouble keeping up with the processing of inspections.

Two years ago, FIU Facilities Management faced a similar situation when expired certificates posted in all university elevators violated Miami-Dade County code. The laws have since changed and the regulation of elevators officially shifted from the county to the state on April 30, 2003.  

"The state of Florida went private two years ago and Miami-Dade County followed their lead," former Miami-Dade County Elevator Supervisor John Miner said.  

According to the Department of Business and Professional Regulations, the elevator regulatory framework in Florida has undergone tremendous change during the last three years. Prior to 2001, the DBPR was responsible for performing inspections, new construction of elevators, producing inspection certificates and other administrative functions.

Since then, legislation was enacted allowing private enterprises to assist the state in performing these functions.

"[The new system] has been designed to result in a sound regulatory program that promotes safety and recognizes the appropriate roles of government, owners, and the elevator industry," Acting Communications Director Meg Shannon said. 

According to Florida Statute chapter 399.061 (1) (a) on elevator safety, all elevators must be annually inspected by a certified elevator inspector in accordance with the appropriate state elevator division.

"The inspections are now done by a private company; we retain a company to do all the inspections in all the elevators in a timely basis," Victor Citarella, assistant vice president of Facilities Management, said.  "We start 30 days before the deadline and rotate them to avoid inspecting them all at the same time, on the same day."

Although administrators say FIU's inspections are up to code, there is some question as to why the certificates are not posted in the elevator car. Currently, the posted notice in the elevators reads: "Original inspection report on file at Facilities Management maintenance offices." 

According to chapter 399.07 (2) of the Florida Statutes, certificates of operation must be posted in a conspicuous location on the elevator and framed with a transparent cover.   

Citarella maintains that the state no longer issues certificates due to changing laws and says that there is no contact person at the state level. But he confirms that Facilities Management has up-to-date reports for every elevator on the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. 

"Originally [Tallahassee was] supposed to, according to the procedures, send certificates but at this point they haven't done so yet," Citarella said. "We don't know when they will and this is why we are keeping the inspection reports in our office."

However state officials say they still issue certificates but admit to possible delays.

"We have had an implementation period [of new laws] over the last year and there may be some certificates that may not be produced yet," Geoff Leuebkemann, director for the Division of Hotels and Restaurants, said.

Facilities Management could face a possible $1,000 fine for every elevator unit without a posted certificate. But Citarella says they are not to blame.

"We don't have [the certificates], so how am I supposed to put them up?" Citarella said.

State officials contest that any unposted certificates are a violation of code.

"Chapter 399 clearly states that the certificates must be in the car. For it not to be in the car is a violation," Leuebkemann, said.

Although inspection reports are filed in the office of Facilities Management, many students find it unusual that the certificates that are not posted in the elevators.

"I usually choose the stairs, the elevators are small and they sometimes smell. The stairs are a safer bet," junior and human resources management major Melissa Coile, said. "Either way, they usually have an out of order sign on them so I am not used to using them very often."

Some students have even gotten stuck in the elevators.

"I've gotten stuck in the elevator between floors and I was able to get out because someone kicked the door open," senior and health science major Jaime Correa, said.

Some faculty members also find unposted certificates a concern and feel that many elevators are old and unstable.

"I haven't really had any major problems with the elevators but I have found that some are slow and feel uncertain," sociology and anthropology professor Guillermo Grenier said.

On the other hand, FIU Public Safety finds the elevators safe and say they have only received six calls regarding elevators so far in 2003. 

Even though, there are no certificates posted in the elevators Facilities Management insists that elevators are safe and up to code. 

"We inspect the elevators on a regular basis because we like to follow the guidelines and the law to the letter," Citarella said. "The elevators are safe...we have a crew that does a lot of preventative maintenance."

Headline: Iranian twins teach us all a lesson in life
Author: Alexander Blanco/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
It  has come to pass that Ladan and Laleh Bijani, the Iranian conjoined twins who yearned to live as separate beings both died on the operating room table. And with them, something else, something more something in each and every one of us, died as well. 

The hopes of their admirers, we who wanted nothing more than to see these two courageous women shy away from the media after their surgery and live their separate lives, with the occasional "CNN Headline" update indicating the intricacies of how they are getting by, expired along with them. We would have all liked to see them smile some summer morning and then go about their individual lives with a twinkle in their eyes and only one head per body. Quite sadly, this will never be.

Last week, a team of 28 doctors, with the aid of about one hundred medical assistants at their beck and call, labored for close to 53 hours in Singapore's Raffles Hospital on what would have been the most unprecedented medical procedure this side of a miracle. Success would have put Lazarus' waking from slumber to shame. 

Try as they might, though, the doctors and neurosurgeons could not put the life back into the Bijani twins. Once split, they survived less than two hours and nothing - not all the King's horses, nor all the King's men - could have put them back together again. 

Now, why would someone write such a cold-blooded thing? The easy answer is that life is not fair - it never was and never will be. The twins knew this from the moment they were cognizant of their unique circumstance. Nothing new under the sun here.

The other reason is that the Bijani twins are more than what their conjoined craniums told us they are - they are a symbol, a metaphor, an idea. And ideas, as is evident in the political arena - e.g., bastardized Communism and the endearing Utopian Anarchy - are much harder to kill than bodies.

But what do they stand for? What would they represent now, dead? I would venture to write that the twins represent a cohesive whole made up of singular parts which, if left to their own, nothing much would have come of singularities. But as a union of lesser parts, these twin women accomplished exemplary feats of regimented activity and unified cohesion that would make our governing bodies blush. They represent what people can do if they just put their heads together.

There are lessons to be learned by this travail, as it acted out one more tragedy in the public Human Drama. One lesson is evident and would seem to be that even though we get what we want, the getting is not always fair. Caveat Emptor resounds in this case more than anywhere else nowadays. Beware what you ask for, you just might get it.

Bioethicists finger point and call names - Were the doctors ethically correct in going about the procedure? Was the procedure sound and did it have a risk factor significantly higher than the acceptable mean? But they are so much sound and fury, signifying their own insignificance. It is much easier to cry foul when a conflagration has blazed. But the fire remains a fire, and a corpse remains a corpse.

Another lesson that can be learned from the twins is one of synergy. Sure, the last few years were ones of sacrifice and unimaginable toil for them, but the simple fact that they achieved twin Bachelor's degrees and lived productive lives speaks quite vociferously about the will to accomplish, the will to strive for the highest rung on the ladder given the deficiencies and setbacks nature tosses our way. These women were forced to work with one another for mutual gain and did so to an astonishing degree of efficiency. 

Now, imagine what our government can do if it works on an even keel with the governing parties of foreign nations? Maybe we can all strive together today for a better tommorrow, before we are forced to and must accept whatever consequences result on the operating room table.

Headline: Editorial: Elevator certificates may be a phone call away; get them
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Thanks to an apparent communications breakdown between state and FIU officials, elevator certificates, which indicate the proper working order of each unit, are missing from elevators on FIU's campuses.

The confusion appears to have originated from changes made in how elevators are regulated, shifting control from Miami-Dade County to the state in conjunction with private contractors.

It's not the first time FIU has run into problems with certificates. In July 2001, under county supervision, FIU had run into similar problems. Back then, Victor Citarella, assistant vice president of Facilities Management, had insisted that FIU was exempt from codes governing elevators. 

"As a state agency, we have our own way of doing things," he said.

As it turned out, he was wrong.

This time, he's changed his defense. According to Citarella, the elevators are safe. To that end, he has the inspection reports to prove it - in his office. The reason, he says, that certificates are not posted is that he simply does not have them. He insists that the state no longer issues those certificates, and that there is no contact person at the state level.

Again, as in the past, he is wrong.

The state does issue those certificates, but there are, due to new laws, some delays in providing those certificates. And the state contact is Geoff Leubkemann, director of Hotels and Restaurants. There is also a self-service website that can provide information on the status of those certificates.

In the end, it's much more black and white an issue than Citarella would like to believe.

"Chapter 399 clearly states that the certificates must be in the car. For it not to be in the car is a violation," Leuebkemann said.

And the penalty is up to $1,000 per offense, a steep price for neglecting to make a phone call.

Headline: Personal responsiblity? Nah, must be a European thing
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
My summers have always been dull. Lots of work, and lots of movies. As I kid I went to Disney of course, but outside of Florida, never. Still, two years ago as a Walgreen's employee, I came across a photo album with a cool, international vintage stamps print on it and I bought it instantly because one, it was on clearance (I have a problem, I know), and two, because I figured that some kind of miracle would appear where I would finally go traveling abroad. 

Well, here I am now, having traveled to Amsterdam, Paris and London for two weeks with two of my best friends over the summer and I've seen exactly how very much the same everybody is, everywhere. Yes, even France.

So what did I, one of the rare people whose only claim to international fame was the ride inside the Epcot ball, think to expect of Europe before leaving, a month ago?

I don't actually remember what I was expecting to be honest, but whatever it was, it sure as hell wasn't what I got. 

Upon arrival at Schnipol Airport, Amsterdam, I was holding my ticket and passport so tightly against my jean pockets I looked like a tin soldier marching across the world. I was given so many warnings about the swarms of pickpockets and angry, anti-American foreigners that would surely assault me upon arrival that really, the anxiety was enough to call it a trip and go home. I was even given fashion tips on what to take by my more travel-savvy pals, and I bought new items that I didn't own before leaving so that I wouldn't be branded as a humiliating American (never mind the hyphen). Anyway, so obediently I avoided sneakers, bright colors, jewelry, talking excitedly, eye contact with strangers and anything with a visible brand name or company logo. Of course after that I wondered "What is it Europeans wear then?!" But I wasn't about to find out the hard way, so I did all but try to disappear.

What a load of (insert compound word literally meaning male cow excrement). 

In the three cities my friends and I visited, there could not have been more loud, brand-name flaunting, ultra-friendly, bright-to-the-point-of-tacky people in Europe than if we had just stepped into GC during Rush Week. 

There was Puma and Reebok and giant Nike logos on white oversized t-shirts and outdoor cafes blasting "Shake dat ting Miss Anabella..." on every corner, and people carrying on conversations loudly, and they were either completely indifferent to who you were or they were glad to practice their English on some disoriented kids. 

I felt so stupid in my monochrome clothes and Earth shoes. I think I blended my way in so deep I stood out the other end like I was sporting fatigues. I still don't understand why I was so afraid that people could tell I was American, as if it was tattooed to my forehead. In fact, I never even knew who other Americans were unless they told me. 

But that aside I was truly impressed by the Old World just across the great big pond. And to be completely honest, what made the most lasting impression of what Europe was like wasn't the Gothic architecture, or the history, or even the Uh-Mazing public transportation system there. Rather, what affected me most profoundly, was the amount of personal responsibility and freedom I was granted in Europe. 

And no, that's not what I mean. Not completely, anyway.

What I mean is low ledges on bridges and towers went unbarred. Windows all swung wide open and since most places were without air conditioning, kids were always playing at the open windows, leaning over at dangerously high altitudes with parents totally unaffected. Dogs went unleashed everywhere and I doubt they've ever seen a sign asking they pick up after their droppings. Never once were we carded for ordering a drink, or asked my age for any reason, really. In general, the feeling overseas was so lackadaisical that I, upon my arrival back home, felt I had actually left the land of the free for the land of the incompetent. 

After that, "Slippery when wet" signs just feel ridiculous to me. If someone slipped in a public place (which must happen often considering the wet sidewalks in Amsterdam from the public urinals) you had a good laugh, or cry, depending the outcome, and walked away. There was no one to blame, no one to sue. If you pet an unleashed dog and it bit you, the owner might be nice and give you a bandage or something. Otherwise, tough luck, dude. Driving was utter madness, with cars driving about a nickel's width apart! Crossing the street became a game of Russian roulette with all the possible ways you could get trampled. There were cars, trams, bicycles and skates and believe me they were brutal. Pedestrians did not have the right of way in any place except London, which I'm convinced is exactly like the United States except for the oh-so-righteous ale. 

It was a real blow to not see one caution sign, or anything potentially harmful go unannounced - plus seeing people in general, being much more aware of their surroundings. But then again, that might seem that way because we were so very unaware. 

Still, in the end I'm glad we won't be adopting the take-care-of-your-own-damn-self code of conduct here in the U.S. any time soon, because then I'd probably be disinclined to go anywhere else, and I already bought more photo albums.

Headline: Running the show
Subheadline: Nathan looking to lead ground game to success
Author: Harry Coleman
&nbsp;
After getting out rushed by opponents last season by more than 100 yards per game, head football coach Don Strock looked to bolster his running unit in early April. 

In order to do so, Strock knew he needed someone he was familiar with, and who could get the wheels of the running game rolling. So when it came time to hire a new running backs coach in early April, Strock hired a proven winner and ex-teammate in Tony Nathan.

An Alabama graduate, Nathan played professional football as running back as a teammate of Strock for the Miami Dolphins from 1979-87. He became a coaches' assistant in 1988 for the Dolphins and was later promoted to offensive backs coach in 1993 where he coached until 1995. 

Nathan's big coaching break came in 1996 when he was hired as running backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers where he coached until 2001 and was let go following the departure of Tony Dungy.

And as an NFL running back that played in two Super Bowls, Nathan knows he has been to the top of the mountain, and uses his experience to teach others how to play the position.

"As a former player, I don't brag about it but just tell them how fortunate I was to have an opportunity to play the position," said Nathan. "It helps them to know I coached and played the position to some other coach trying to coach a position he never played."

Having starred as a college back in Alabama from 1975-78, Nathan knows what it takes to be a successful ground-gainer at the collegiate level.

"I ask of my players what can be done and what I know is possible," said Nathan who led Alabama to a national championship in 1976. "I'm not going to ask them something I couldn't do myself."

Last season the team averaged a modest 105 yards per game, but were out played by opposing teams allowing 216 yards per game, a difference of 111 yards more per game. 

However, Nathan sees potential to improve this season.

"I see lots of potential to be a fairly decent running team. We have a group of talented backs and it is up to me to bring out their outermost potential," added Nathan.

But Nathan knows he has his work cut out. He says the biggest challenge has been the transition from being an NFL coach to the college level.

"In the NFL you only deal with players in the office or when they did something wrong. Here I am a father figure to the players telling them to go to class, do their homework, and stay out of trouble. I get a chance to see them grow and mature into society," said Nathan.

And his players have taken a liking to his coaching style.

"His maturity of the position helps us a lot. He knows the keys to the game and all the in and outs of the position. He is a great player-coach to talk to," said running back Diamos Demerritt. "He is a great father figure, always checking up on us."

But even with all his experience, Nathan still considers himself a student of the game.

"I don't know it all and sometimes I still learn new things from my players. Sometimes they teach me a better and different way to do something and by accident it turns out good so we keep it," added Nathan.

And having a good relationship with the head coach is something that the Golden Panthers hope will increase team chemistry.

Nathan and Strock are remembered for their "hook and ladder" play in 1982 where Nathan scored on a 25-yard run following a lateral pass set up by quarterback Strock.

"Our backs know Tony has done it all before and he brings something they can believe in," said Strock back in April. "He relates to his players and they respect him. Maybe he can even teach them a few of the old tricks that he used when he was a player."

After playing together in the NFL, Nathan and Strock have remained friends, which triggered Strock to make the move when he learned of Nathan's availability.

"Don and I worked together in Miami as teammates and have been friends since. Here at FIU we have a relaxed atmosphere and it's a great situation to be in," said Nathan.

Now, the next step for Nathan and Strock is to decide on a starting running back before the season opener.

"We have a few guys competing for the starting job but because I am new, I am just starting to see what I have to work with. The competition we got going on makes us all better and makes the decision much harder," said Nathan. 

But no matter whom Nathan names starter, he knows he has talent at running back to win games on the ground, and it's his duty to take the unit to the next level.

Headline: With men's soccer's fate in limbo, Kremser focusing on "making progress this season"
Author: Alain Castillo
&nbsp;
Things were looking great for FIU soccer a year ago at this time.

The team was loaded with talent and ready for a monster season, and didn't disappoint, winning the conference title and advancing to the second round of the NCAA tournament. 

But just when things started to look bright for the soccer program's future, lightning struck and the team was cut out of the athletic program in January.

After careful examination, the team was temporarily reinstated almost a month later for two additional years.

Now a year later, the hobbling program is just trying to play the cards they have been dealt and make the best of the situation.

With this reality in mind, head coach Karl Kremser says that the important issue is not their long-term future, rather focusing on the team's immediate goals.

"We are looking forward to playing good soccer, win the conference title, look forward to the playoffs and be passed the second round," says Kremser.

In order to do so, FIU will basically have to work with what they have, although they have signed a few top-notch recruits despite the team's possible elimination in two years.

And Kremser has been doing this by recruiting transfers from other schools.

The new additions include Carron Williams, a forward from Tobago, who transferred from Mobile, Alabama. Williams is said to be the fastest soccer player in the entire country. 

Kremser also went into the heart of Beckham Land, and signed transfer David Hope, a forward from England.

In addition, Kremser hopes Miami Coral Park midfielder Mario Franka and Icelandic defender Eythor Einarsson can help the team meet its goals. 

According to Kremser, Einarsson is said to have great size for a defender, which is something the team needs.

As for the reinstatement issue, the team and staff have tried to increase revenue. The Athletic Department's Spring Fun Week helped them raise money and they hosted exhibition matches against DC United and the Kansas City Wizards of the MLS in February and March, and plan on scheduling more games like that.

However, Kremser is taking the situation a day at a time.

"We want to focus on our season. The best we can do is make progress this season," said Kremser.

He says he was grateful that the entire team stayed together and credits the team's attitude and effort during such an unstable time.

And factoring in the new additions to the team, FIU soccer is looking forward to continuing its winning tradition and is hopeful their success can save the sinking program from extinction.

Headline: Commentary: MLB season midway through; time to review
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
July has arrived, and for baseball fans and even for people who despise the 162-game marathon, this means only one thing - we're halfway done.

With that said, it's time to survey the scene and find out who's making waves around the league, and who's already buried midway through the 2003 season.

Best Team-AL

Very tough decision, but the Seattle Mariners get the nod over the Yankees and Red Sox.

Seattle has the AL's best record, as well as the best pitching staff in the league. They also have five All-Stars in Ichiro, Bret Boone, Edgar Martinez, Jamie Moyer, and Shigetoshi Hasegawa, and they have supplanted Oakland, who led the division at this time last year, as the hunted in the West.

Cinderella Team-AL

No doubt here - it's the Kansas City Royals. The Royal Ones, who were 100-game losers a season ago, have suddenly become the premier team in the AL Central, already establishing a commanding seven-game lead over last year's division winner, Minnesota. And the Royals are the only team in the Central with a winning record.

Worst Team-AL

Well if it isn't everybody's favorite losers, the Detroit Tigers. After losing a league-high 106 games last year, the Tigers have already lost 67 games and are on pace to shatter that mark and possibly the Major-League record of 120 games set by the New York Mets. This should be something fun to watch down the stretch.

Best Pitcher-AL

Toronto's Roy Halladay has emerged as one of baseball's elite starting pitchers. He has the AL's best record at 13-2, and ranks third in strikeouts with 115. Halladay has also been a workhorse for the Blue Jays, pitching a league-high 153 innings. And the most remarkable thing about Halladay is that he has not lost a start since April 15. If only the rest of the Toronto pitching staff could chip in, the Blue Jays and their dynamite offense could make a wild card run.

MVP-AL

No debate here as Toronto's Carlos Delgado has put up ridiculous numbers thus far for baseball's second-ranked offense. He already has an AL-leading 28 homeruns and an astonishing major-league-leading 98 RBI to go along with his .313 batting average. There would be no wild card hopes for the Jays without Delgado.

Best Team-NL

This one is a no-brainer. The Atlanta Braves have the best record in baseball, and boast a major-league-high seven All-Stars in Gary Sheffield, Andruw Jones, Rafael Furcal, Marcus Giles, Javy Lopez, Russ Ortiz, and John Smoltz. The Braves also have the second-ranked offense in the NL and look like the favorite to reach the World Series.

Cinderella Team-NL

This one is too close to call, so I'm going to call it a tie between the Chicago Cubs and Florida Marlins. 

The Cubs, who lost 95 games last year, spent most of the season on top of the NL Central before being overtaken by St. Louis and Houston three weeks ago. Nonetheless, the Cubs (47-47) are only 2.5 games back of first place, and Sammy Sosa has just begun to heat up. 

The Marlins, on the other hand, were just about to throw in the towel and trade their best player, Mike Lowell, when they suddenly had a change of heart and realized they wanted to do what they should have been doing all along - make the playoffs. Now, after acquiring Ugueth Urbina, the AL's save leader, the Marlins are now focused on riding the Dontrelle Express right into the postseason. Only four games behind the wild-card leading Phillies, Florida now believes they can make a serious push in the NL.

Worst Team-NL

Relax Mets fans. You are off the hook. There actually is a team worse than you. In fact, there are two of them. But since I can only pick one, I'll have to dismiss Milwaukee and go with the San Diego Padres. The Padres are not only bad, they are awful. Their 35-61 record is the worst in the NL and third worst in the majors behind Detroit and Tampa Bay. Besides that, their lone All-Star representative is Rondell White. Rondell White? But cheer up Pads' fans. It could be worse. You could be a Tigers fan.

Best Pitcher-NL

Two months ago, Los Angeles' Kevin Brown was in cruise control, and could of locked this award up in his trunk. Suddenly, in his rear view mirror appeared an unknown 21-year old rookie hurler named Dontrelle Willis. And two months later, the new Marlins ace has proven to be the best pitcher in baseball this season, going 9-1 with a 2.08 ERA in 12 starts. Willis has taken the league by storm, with his only loss coming on May 20 to Montreal. How important has Willis become to the Marlins? Well if you can believe it, there are actually fans in the seats at Marlins games now. I'm not lying. And with Willis playing the way he is, the Marlins seem primed to make a playoff push. 

MVP-NL

Florida's Mike Lowell, Atlanta's Gary Sheffield, and even Colorado's Preston Wilson are all having good enough seasons to typically win an MVP award, but all three can keep dreaming as long as Albert Pujols is in the league. Besides being the best hitter on the NL's best hitting team, Pujols just might be the best hitter in the entire major league. He is batting .368 with 27 homeruns, and 86 RBI -  and remember, this is at the season's midpoint. And Pujols has a chance of winning the Triple Crown, only if some guy named Bonds stops hitting homeruns every four at-bats. But it's safe to say that without Pujols, the Cardinals would be way out of playoff contention.

Postseason Outlook

In my eyes, there are only five teams with a realistic shot of winning the World Series, and four of them do battle in the AL.

The AL is loaded with the Yankees, Red Sox, Athletics, and Mariners.

Unfortunately, because a team like Kansas City will get a bid from the lame AL Central, one of these four will not make the playoffs, because only one can make the wild card, considering two of the other three win the division.

As for the NL, the Braves look like the only consistent team, with the Giants also remaining a possibility.

But look for one of the four AL powerhouses to knock off Atlanta in the World Series.

Headline: Todo por una piel canela: leyes, peligros y opciones del bronceado artificial
Subheadline: María de Lourdes García
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
La Florida cuenta con una ley que establece controles a los centros de bronceado. El estatuto dispone que todo negocio de este tipo tiene que estar licenciado por el Departamento de Salud, que todo menor que quiera someterse a sesiones de bronceado tiene que tener autorización de su tutor y que todo menor de 14 años que llegue a uno de estos centros tiene que estar acompañado de un adulto. 

Además, el estatuto dispone que todo operador de las máquinas debe haber sido certificado por el Departamento de Salud, que cada facilidad debe mantener el récord de sus clientes durante un mínimo de cuatro años y que el operador del centro es el responsable del mantenimiento de todo el equipo utilizado en el procedimiento. 

Por otra parte, el centro debe tener un lista de los medicamentos y alimentos que sus clientes no pueden consumir si se someten al bronceado artificial. La última disposición del estatuto establece que el centro debe colocar en un lugar visible una advertencia sobre los peligros de los rayos ultravioletas y de no utilizar gafas protectoras durante la sesión bronceadora.

La Agencia Federal de Medicinas y Químicos de los Estados Unidos (FDA) les exige a los dueños de estas camas que sus equipos tengan un reloj que establezca el tiempo máximo en que una persona puede estar expuesta a los rayos ultravioletas en una sesión. Además, deben contar con un cartel que indique cuál es la distancia a la que debe colocarse la persona desde la lámpara para evitar el riesgo de sobre exposición y acortar la onda de radiación que emiten los rayos ultravioletas. 

En tercer lugar, el centro debe proveer unas gafas especiales para proteger los ojos y advertir sobre los riesgos de la sobre exposición, especialmente a aquellas personas sensibles a los rayos ultravioletas.

En Tanning Hut Unlimited están cumpliendo con estas reglas, según dijeron clientas entrevistadas. El problema está en que estas mujeres nuncas fueron examinadas para determinar si tienen pieles sensibles a los rayos ultravioletas. Ni siquiera les recomendaron que fueran a un dermatólogo antes tomar su primera sesión de bronceado, aseguró Verónica Moreno, una asidua cliente.

Por su parte, Zayda Rodríguez, también cliente de Tanning Hut Unlimited, dijo que no fue a un dermatólogo porque no sabía que fuera necesario. La joven, que luce un color bronceado parejo en su cuerpo, aseguró que en las primeras sesiones sintió que su piel se ponía roja, como cuando toma sol, pero nunca pensó que los efectos fueran similares. 

Por contraste, en Barcelona, España, el debate sobre los centros de bronceado llevó a la aprobación de una ley que indica cómo tienen que operar los centros de bronceado artificial. 

La ley-decreto, aprobada en diciembre del 2001, exige que los consumidores reciban orientación, que se garantice el mantenimiento de los equipos y que los empleados de estos lugares tengan una preparación académica mínima.

Esta la ley establece, además, que los clientes potenciales no pueden consumir una serie de medicamentos, como antibióticos, somníferos, antidepresivos ni antisépticos. 

En Tanning Hut Unlimited se comprobó la existencia de un cartel que alerta a los clientes sobre los medicamentos que no pueden tomar si van a someterse a una sesión. 

Sobre este mismo asunto, la Academia Americana de Dermatología afirma que los pacientes que utilizan Naproxen, que viene en pastillas como el Naprosyn y Aleve, pueden sufrir de fotosensibilidad, una sensibilidad extrema a la luz. Las consecuencias son quemaduras serias. 

Es importante que en el centro se le advierta al cliente que su  piel debe estar libre de perfumes, maquillajes y otros cosméticos que pueden reaccionar negativamente ante los rayos UVA y provocar quemaduras, manchas y otras lesiones. Debe ser un especialista el que determine por cuánto tiempo durará la sesión y no el propio usuario el que decida cuánto va a durar cada sesión. El máximo de tiempo recomendado por sesión es de 15 minutos. 

Moreno relató que en Tanning Hut Unlimited, hay control en cuanto al tiempo de exposición. Pero durante el período en que el cliente está en la cama, este se encuentra solo. La joven recordó que un día ella misma tuvo que apagar la máquina porque se sentía muy caliente y no podía aguantar la temperatura.

Moreno opina que el objetivo de los dueños de los centros es "vender, vender y vender", ya que se han dado cuenta de que hay una gran clientela para el producto. Hoy que está informada sobre los riesgos que estuvo tomando, entiende que estas personas son irresponsables, ya que lo mínimo que deben hacer es decirle la verdad al cliente para que tomen una decisión informada sobre si quieren o no usar las camas bronceadoras.

Camas bronceadoras más sol

Craig Cunningham tiene 41 años de edad. El director de la Oficina de Servicios de Empleo del Biscayne Bay Campus de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida tuvo que someterse a una cirugía para extirparle varias partes de su piel en las que desarrolló eritemas, que son lesiones superficiales caracterizadas por el enrojecimiento de la piel. De no haberse tratado a tiempo, esta condición habría desembocado en cáncer en la piel.

Si pudiera darles un consejo a las personas que acuden a usar las camas bronceadoras, este sería que las descarten, afirmó Cunningham. 

"Les diría que no las usaran porque en algún momento de sus vidas podrían tener que enfrentar operaciones, cicatrices", sostuvo. 

Su comentario está basado en la experiencia que le ha tocado vivir. Al momento de esta entrevista, Cunningham tenía tres incisiones en la piel de su pecho y espalda, cubiertas por gasas, ya que pocos días antes había tenido que someterse a una cirugía para eliminarle los puntos en la piel afectados por los eritemas.

Los médicos de Cunningham no saben con exactitud que provocó que este hombre de tez blanca y pecosa y de cabello rubio rojizo desarrollara esta condición. Lo que si saben es que la exposición a los rayos ultravioletas está detrás del diagnóstico.

El problema de Cunningham es que combinó dos prácticas sumamentes peligrosas para cualquier persona y para él, que tiene una piel tipo 1, muchísimo más. Cunningham optó por tomar sol en la playa y usar camas bronceadoras. 

Cunningham recuerda que en su adolescencia frecuentaba mucho la playa junto a su familia. No utilizaba protección para la piel e, incluso, en ocasiones se aplicaba aceite de bebé para "quemarse la piel". 

Después de vivir en la Florida, Cunningham se mudó al estado de Washington. Entre 1984 y 1994, visitó un centro de bronceado, al menos una vez a la semana. Cuando podía viajar a la zona costera, lo hacía para tomar sol. De regreso a la Florida, comenzó a frecuentar un centro de bronceado porque no tenía tiempo para ir a la playa. Dice que pasó muy poco tiempo asistiendo a las sesiones, ya que notó que le había salido un punto rojo en la piel. En un principio, su doctor pensó que se trataba de un salpullido. Pero al someterse a una biopsia, Cunningham se dio cuenta de que se trataba de un eritema.

Cunningham no recibió orientación sobre los riesgos de las camas bronceadoras, ni en los centros de Washington ni en el de Miami. 

"Cuando llené la solicitud, tuve que firmar un contrato que dice que estás conciente de los riesgos detrás del uso de las camas bronceadoras", dijo Cunningham, quien lo entiende como "una especie de relevo de responsabilidad". 

Aunque nunca abusó del uso de la lámpara, a Cunningham nadie le advirtió que no podía usarla más de dos veces por semana ni que por su tipo de piel esta práctica no era recomendable. Tampoco en los establecimientos comerciales encontró a un dermatólogo que le evaluara su piel antes de iniciar las sesiones de bronceado.

¡Precaución!

Es importante que si la persona decide seguir acudiendo a los centros de bronceado siga las recomendaciones de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. 

En primer lugar, si la persona tiene una piel blanca y delicada, pecas, muchos lunares, antecedentes familiares de cáncer en la piel, alguna lesión, si está embarazada o si está tomando medicamentos, la persona no debe someterse a un bronceado con rayos ultravioleta (UVA). 

Los rayos UVA penetran profundamente en la piel y pueden provocar lesiones importantes, desde eritemas, que son las lesiones leves hasta melanomas, que son las serias. Además, no todas las cabinas de bronceado se encuentran en buen estado ni cumplen con todos los elementos requeridos por el fabricante, por lo que algunas llegan a emitir también rayos UVB o incluso UVC. 

Si la persona toma un medicamento, debe consultar con su médico antes de broncearse artificialmente. Muchas medicinas tienen un efecto acelerador y pueden desencadenar reacciones alérgicas como urticaria. Esta es una enfermedad eruptiva de la piel, cuyo síntoma más notable es una comezón parecida a la que producen las picaduras, eczemas, o manchas en la piel. 

Además de las medicinas, algunos tipos de cosméticos y desodorantes pueden contener sustancias acelerantes. Por eso es recomendable que la persona se quite el maquillaje antes de cada sesión de bronceado.

En tercer lugar, no debe tomar más de 50 sesiones al año ni exponerse más tiempo del que le indique el responsable del centro. Es importante evitar exponerse al sol tras una sesión de bronceado con rayos UVA. 

Otro punto importante es que la persona debe utilizar gafas especiales durante el tiempo de exposición en la lámpara y si usa lentes de contacto, tiene que quitárselos. Finalmente, el cliente debe asegurarse de que el centro certifique el estado de sus máquinas y que los empleados han recibido un adiestramiento especial para operarlas.

No todo es malo

Aunque parezca que todo sobre las camas bronceadoras es negativo, un estudio realizado por el Departamento de Dermatología de la Universidad de Utah, en Salt Lake City, confirma que un tratamiento contra la psoriasis, que combina el medicamento acitretin con sesiones diarias de bronceado artificial, ha dado resultados positivos en los pacientes. 

La psoriasis es una condición crónica de la piel, que se manifiesta por costras, manchas, granos u otra forma de erupción.

Como parte del estudio, sometieron durante 12 semanas a 23 pacientes al referido tratamiento. El 71 por ciento de los pacientes, es decir 19 personas, mostraron una mejoría dramática en la condición de la piel. 

El doctor Christopher Carlin, autor del estudio, al presentar los resultados del mismo durante la asamblea anual de la Academia Americana de Dermatología dijo que el hecho de que se recomienden las camas para personas con este tipo de enfermedad no implica que no reconozcan los riesgos de su uso. 

Para las personas con psoriasis, el médico sopesa los beneficios versus los efectos secundarios de los rayos ultravioletas. Carlin concluyó que definitivamente los beneficios para estos pacientes son mayores que los riesgos. 

Sin correr riesgos

Una de las opciones más seguras para lograr un bronceado son los autobronceadores. Estos productos son sustancias que colorean la piel al provocar una reacción en las células epidérmicas. La coloración se produce sin la necesidad de energía. Normalmente son cremas con extracto de nuez, aceite de zanahoria o extracto de té.

La Academia Americana de Dermatología insta a las personas que quieren lucir un bronceado a que utilicen estos productos que utilizan también un compuesto conocido como dihydorxyacetone, el cual trabaja con las proteínas de las células para oscurecer temporalmente la piel. La FDA considera este ingrediente como seguro para la salud.

Diversas empresas que mercadean productos de esta naturaleza aseguran que no hay peligro alguno por su uso. Aunque les recuerdan a sus consumidores que los autobronceadores no son un producto para proteger la piel, las empresas afirman que sus productos simplemente colorean la piel sin efectos secundarios.

La desventaja del autobronceado es que si la persona no se aplica el producto al menos una vez en semana, el color bronce irá desapareciendo en pocos días.

Si no le convencen los autobronceadores, no tiene otra opción que tomar el sol de manera responsable. Todos los peligros de los rayos solares se derivan de una exposición excesiva e irresponsable, apuntan los dermatólogos. 

Sin embargo, no hay que olvidar que el sol es una fuente de salud que debe usarse adecuadamente para aprovechar todos sus beneficios. La luz solar ayuda a fortalecer huesos y músculos, mejora el estado de ánimo, aumenta la capacidad del sistema inmunológico para hacer frente a agresiones externas y es imprescindible para producir la vitamina D en el cuerpo.

También, el sol impide el raquitismo en los niños y es beneficioso en el tratamiento de patologías dermatológicas como la psoriasis o el acné.

La clave para disfrutar del sol es la moderación. Use siempre una crema protectora número 15. En el caso de niños y personas extremadamente blancas, la numeración debe ser mayor. No olvide aplicarlo cada dos o tres horas cuando se exponga al astro rey.

&nbsp;
El Islam predica igualdad, sin embargo, en la mayoría de los países musulmanes, el lugar de una mujer está determinado por la voluntad del hombre. Es la ley.

Un esposo puede prohibirle a su esposa viajar al extranjero y la policía protegería su derecho legal de retenerla. Un padre puede obligar a su hija a contraer matrimonio en contra de su voluntad y ella, por ley, debe obedecer. Si una mujer vive en un matrimonio sin amor, con contadas excepciones, su esposo puede abandonarla con simplemente decir "yo te divorcio". Ella no tiene derecho a hacer lo mismo. 

Pero los días en los que la mujer permanecía encerrada en la casa, protegida y alejada de la sociedad están lejos en gran parte del mundo musulmán. A medida que el modernismo choca con la tradición religiosa, la mujer ha empezado a exigir la reinterpretación de los códigos civiles que presumen que una mujer, en su vida privada, es una criatura caprichosa que necesita la mano orientadora de un hombre.

El libro de la escritora australiana Geraldine Brooks, Nueves partes del deseo, muestra a través del periodismo crítico y una perspectiva histórica, el mundo oculto de las mujeres mulsumanas. 

El título se refiere a unaa expresión de Ali ibn Abu Taleb, el creador de la secta chiíta del Islam y esposo de Fátima, la hija del profeta Mahoma. Taleb afirmó: "Dios todopoderoso creó el deseo sexual en diez partes; entonces le dio nueve partes a la mujer y una al hombre". 

El libro trata el viaje en que Brooks se embarca para entender a las mujeres detrás de sus velos y las contradictorias fuerzas religiosas, políticas y culturales que moldean sus vidas. Dentro de las asombrosas anécdotas del libro de Brooks, se encuentra la experiencia de haber estado detenida en una estación policial de Arabia Saudita por ser mujer y tratar de hospedarse sola en un hotel.

La autora también comparte relatos sobre mujeres occidentales convertidas a la religión por amor, la lucha de las mujeres por lograr una voz en la política y la sociedad del Medio Oriente y la conformidad de algunas mujeres religiosas al sistema. 

Desafiando estereotipos acerca del mundo musulmán, el agudo análisis que Brooks hace sobre el Islam, la religión que actualmente se expande con mayor rapidez en el mundo, ilustra cómo los textos más sagrados - el Corán y el Hadith - se han usado de manera incorrecta para justificar la represión hacia las mujeres, y cómo el orgullo masculino y el poder han tergiversado el mensaje original de una fe que alguna vez fue libertadora.

Brooks, galardonada por su trabajo como corresponsal extranjera para The Wall Street Journal, estuvo seis años cubriendo las guerras del Medio Oriente, las insurrecciones y el levantamiento del fundamentalismo islámico. Muchas de las historias que quiso cubrir le fueron negadas por el simple hecho de ser mujer. El panorama le mostraba a los fundamentalistas tomando el poder en países como Afganistán, Argelia y Sudán. En Egipto y Jordania, poderosas minorías empujaban a sus gobiernos hacia la Sharia o ley islámica. Los musulmanes que emigraban hacia el oeste hacían pedidos como eliminar los libros ofensivos, dejar que sus hijas usaran velo para ir a la escuela y crear salones de clase segregados sexualmente. Para entender la profundidad de estos cambios, Brooks afirma que hizo algo tan obvio que "no pude creer que me tomara un año descifrarlo. Empecé a hablarle a las mujeres".

A pesar de que los defensores modernos del Islam a menudo señalan que la religión defiende la igualdad sexual y que ha mejorado la calidad de vida de las mujeres a partir del siglo siete, Brooks dice que "hoy, la tarea más urgente e importante es examinar la manera en que esta fe ha absorbido casi todas las tradiciones en contra de la mujer que encontró a su paso por Arabia". 

Brooks escribe de las mujeres que conoció durante su estancia en el Medio Oriente. Describe, además, los abusos a los derechos humanos cometidos por interpretaciones extremas de la religión, como la clitoridectomía en los países de África del norte.

Siendo mujer, Brooks considera intrigantes las historias de mujeres occidentales convertidas al Islam por amor, porque ella se convirtió al Judaísmo por la misma razón. De las mujeres que conoció piensa que la más interesante es Janet Mamoudzadeh, una estadounidense que se casó con un iraní y se mudó a Irán. Mamoudzadeh vivió la revolución y la guerra contra Irak aislada de su antiguo país. En vez de conformarse a vivir oprimida, Mamoudzadeh se convirtió en una activista de la comunidad enseñando en escuelas de niñas, ayudando a los huérfanos minusválidos y mostrando lo que una mujer fuerte puede hacer. 

"Ella obtuvo el respeto de todos, desde la gente religiosa conservadora hasta los disidentes. Respetó la tradición pero esperó a cambio que la gente la respetara a ella y a sus ideas", escribe Brooks.

El Islam en la actualidad

Hace casi 1,400 años, Dios le reveló al profeta Mahoma que debía encerrar a sus esposas para protegerlas. Gradualmente las reglas creadas para salvaguardar el prestigio de las esposas del profeta se aplicaron a otras mujeres musulmanas.

En Arabia Saudita la mayoría de las mujeres aún viven escondidas del mundo. Siendo uno de los países más fundamentalistas, gran parte de la población considera que no existe rol alguno para la mujer fuera de la casa. Las mujeres sauditas, quienes son mantenidas ocultas de todos los hombres que no sean familiares cercanos, no pueden conducir ni poseer cargos públicos. Deben cumplir el estricto código de vestir que consiste en el uso de la abaya, la burka y el hijab, de lo contrario, podrían ser amonestadas por la policía religiosa o agredidas con comentarios y miradas sugestivas de los hombres en las calles. 

Mientras miles de hombres sauditas se benefician de la educación en el extranjero a expensas del dinero del gobierno, las mujeres no han recibido tales becas desde 1980. El gobierno ha expresado que las oportunidades de educación para la mujer han mejorado dentro del reino hasta el punto que todas las necesidades de una mujer pueden ser satisfechas dentro de sus fronteras. Las necesidades educacionales, según las reglas del Ministerio de Educación Superior, se resumen en "brindarle conocimiento de una manera religiosa para que ella pueda cumplir con su rol en la vida como exitosa ama de casa, esposa ideal y buena madre, y prepararla para otras actividades que se adapten a su naturaleza como la enseñanza, enfermería y medicina". 

Muy diferente es la situación en Irán. Hoy día existe una verdadera discusión con elementos liberales que promueven cambios en la sociedad y estructura política. Muchos intelectuales, hombres y mujeres, trabajan para cambiar las cosas desde el lado religioso. Para las mujeres, el chador - prenda de vestir obligatoria en Irán y característica de los musulmanes chiítas - no es lo más importante. Hay otros asuntos que tienen más valor, como la libertad para escoger a sus parejas para el matrimonio, la independencia para trabajar y el derecho a tener la custodia legal de los niños en caso de divorcio. 

Hasta ahora se han logrado muchas cosas. Existen mujeres diplomáticas, estudiantes en el extranjero y gerentes de grandes compañías, entre otros cargos. De un 50 por ciento de mujeres analfabetas que había durante el régimen del Shah, el índice ha cambiado a un 98 por ciento de mujeres instruidas. Esto ha sido un gran logro por parte de la sociedad religiosa que confió en el sistema del Ayatolá Khomeini, el cual permite que sus hijas estudien e incluso, si es necesario, vivan fuera de casa.

Es difícil pronosticar el futuro de las mujeres en los países musulmanes. Brooks piensa que algunos de ellos, como Arabia Saudita, seguirán encerrados en el mundo medieval. Otros, como Irán, parecen estar abriéndose a una mayor participación femenina. Sin embargo, esto puede no significar mucho para las mujeres de Occidente pero "para las mujeres que viven en los lugares más estrictos del mundo musulmán, la mujer iraní yendo al trabajo en su motocicleta, a pesar de tener el ondeante chador agarrado firmemente con los dientes, representa una figura envidiable".

Headline: Sobre la belleza y lo que vale en la vida
Subheadline: Awilda I. Castro Suárez
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;

A todas las mujeres que no necesitan de un lapiz labial ni una cirugía para sentirse hermosas, sobre todo a ti, María Mercedes.

Como esta es mi columna de despedida me tomo el atrevimiento de escribir en primera persona, de dedicarle lo que escribo a quien amo y decir algo que llevo pensando desde hace mucho. 

Ser mujer no es cosa fácil, que si la menstruación, que si el síndrome premenstrual, la depresión post-parto y otras mil cosas que nos venden en paquetitos lindos y lustrosos. Ahora para ser bonita hay que sacarse dos costillas, morirse de anorexia o bulimia, ponerse Botox en las arrugas, silicona para aumentar la pechonalidad y tomarse una clase de cómo sonreir en respuesta a cualquier pregunta seria. 

Esto me pone a pensar en una mujer que si le mencionabas Clinique o Loreal, los iba a confundir con ungüentos para las dolamas. Y tal vez su confusión era acertada: debe doler mucho el alma para que alguien piense que su belleza va a ser mayor al ponerse emplastos en la cara. 

Esa mujer que en su vida se puso pestañas postizas, tenía una belleza interior. La única crema que se ponía en las noches era crema "Pond's" y no era para encubrir las arrugas sino para que sus nietos sintieran sus mejillas suaves. Pero esta sociedad le rinde un culto obsesivo a la juventud, vive esclava de la apariencia. 

Esta carga es mayor para las mujeres porque rara vez se escucha "no te preocupes eres una muchacha capaz". El mantra es: "todavía eres bonita y joven y puedes conseguir un hombre que te quiera." Es como si el único valor existente fuera la belleza. Que si vamos a ser lógicos es una cuestión relativa, si los africanos que se estiran los lóbulos de las orejas tuvieran tan buenos relacionistas públicos, como los modelitos Gap y Banana Republic, estaríamos todos con las orejas colgándonos por los hombros. 

La belleza interior no es tan exigida, sólo una vez al año cuando eligen a la Miss Universo y las candidatas contestan, invariablemente, que trabajarán para la paz mundial y por los niños pobres. En los últimos concursos, la Madre Teresa de Calcuta ha hecho mucha falta pues ya no pueden tomarla de chivo expiatorio y decir con voz modosita, que quieren conocerla. Y es que la palabra modelo, siempre me alza ronchas en la piel. ¿Acaso todo el que pose frente a una cámara y haga anuncios merece ser un modelo, alguien que los demás debemos seguir? Lo más curioso de todo es que estas bellezas son retocadas, hechas a fuerza de bisturí, de silicona, de liposucciones. Y ni hablar de los milagros que hace el Photoshop en las portadas de las revistas. Así que muchas veces esta "belleza" es artificial. 

Tener unos rollitos de más no está de moda, los métodos de adelgazar causan furor y resuenan los rimbobantes anuncios de "rebaje veinte libras en una semana y luzca mejor."

Esto me hace pensar en que es lo que realmente vale. Acaso un ser que sea amable, dedicado a los demás, servicial ¿no es también hermoso, bello? Cuando ya el colágeno se va del rostro y la piel cuelga, ¿ya no se es hermoso? La persona más hermosa en mi vida es María Mercedes, una mujer con más arrugas que una pasa. Crecí pensando que la belleza era ser arrugado, tener achaques porque esos seres arrugados y "no bellos", según el canon, son los que me enseñaron a leer, los que me cuidaron la fiebre, los que sonrieron conmigo. Esos seres obesos, son los que planchan mi ropa en la tintorería, los que me sonríen en los autobuses. La gente hermosa y bella es la que cada día se permite ver más allá de artificialidades y de construcciones.

My son will be graduating from FIU next Spring.I would like to suggest two ideas to help make his graduation-and that of other students a little more pleasant.
1.The Tamiami campus should have some kind of yearbook with the pictures of all of the graduates for that year. Even if it is black and white with soft cover with no frills, I am sure the graduating students will be thankful.
2.The graduation celebration should take place in a location where family and friends can sit confortably, with out fear of falling.The seating in current location, the Gym, it is terrible.The seats are hard and have no backing. In addition, people-especially ladies in high heels can fall as they go up the bleechers. I am sure the cost for both ideas is minimal.In the future, a nomimal fee can be included in the student fee for this purpose.
From a parent to the Spring 2004 graduating class:What about it?

DJs should be fined for their antics, not praised



To the Editor:



John Colagrande, you have your head up your ass, sir. I agree with the previous poster: These idiotic [disc jockeys] should stop doing their stupid pranks on world leaders, it gives the [United States] a bad name. 

Instead, I suggest they should be fined and taken off the air for their stupidity. How would you like it if someone prank called you on the national airways and insulted you? Wouldn't you be angry too? 

These type of childish pranks are harmful. When Cuban agents beat the s--- out of these fools no one should complain. 

Also, whether you believe these leaders are just or not is irrelevant. Harassing them with prank calls does not make good diplomacy, unless you are at war. 

Lots of people think George W. Bush is an idiot who has broken international law. Should we be prank calling Bush on national airwaves? As much as I dislike Bush such assaults can best be termed "ad hominem" attacks and say more about the pranksters than the victim.

Subheadline: Miami nightlife uncovers a variety of street racers
Author: Blha Blha/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As the city sleeps, a once vacant parking lot is transformed into a living, breathing plethora of rip-roaring, vibrating, muffler-flaring racing cars--customized to outrace, outlast and smoke the competition. On Tuesday and Thursday nights, many South Floridians, including FIU students take their cars to the streets.  Loaded with supercharged engines, Nitrous Oxide and high performance custom improvements, they infuse the night with the urban sounds of a growing sub car culture. 

These mechanically and electronically enhanced racing cars are modified to help street racers succumb to the allures of an often-deadly "sport." Rushing at speeds of over 80 miles per hour, racers seem to play a high stakes game of Russian roulette with local law enforcement officers. 

"Street racing is a big problem ... [and] with movies that idolize it, kids don't realize the carnage that is involved in a car accident," Officer Adam Shahan of the Miami-Dade County Police Department said. "Your body can't take an 80 mile [per hour] accident into a tree, a solid object or another car while your racing." 

In 2002, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported that numbers totaled as high as 375 teenage deaths due to fatal motor vehicle crashes.  In 2001, the national costs of speeding-related crashes were estimated to be $40.4 billion - that is equivalent to $76,865 per minute or $1,281 per second.

As reported in The Miami Herald and other local newspapers, several recent deaths due to street racing have begun to raise eyebrows. On June 13, the 17-year-old son of a South Florida police officer was killed after racing and crashing his Corvette into a concrete pole.  

A couple of weeks later, an alleged street racer claimed the life of a local man who was reported dead after being trapped in his box truck when it burst into flames. 

The National Center for Health Statistics reports that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15 to 20-year-olds based on 1998 figures. 

According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 5,582 teenagers died in motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2001. IIHS also reported that in 2001, the highest motor vehicle death rate was among 20 to 24-year-olds.

The number of accidents due to street racing has many Floridians questioning the adequacy of Florida laws.

"Part of the problem is that laws let 16-year-olds drive. Parents are also giving kids cars that they can't handle, without giving them the right education," said Lou Romero, co-founder of Autobahn Touring, a group of German car enthusiasts. 

Complaints of weak laws have led to recent changes of toughened laws targeting illegal street racing. 

A law past last year makes street racing a misdemeanor instead of a moving violation. First-time street-racing offenders face a $250 to $500 fine and the loss of their licenses for a year. Repeat offenders face a $1,000 fine and a two-year suspension of their licenses.

In one night, local car enthusiasts will travel as much as 15 miles: eluding police officers and becoming a nuisance to local businesses. First gathering on Bird Road's Tropical Park, German car fans meet to share tips and fix up their cars. 

"We meet here [at the park] because it's a chance for us to work on our cars and hang out with each other," Christian Brocca, a junior, architecture major, said.

After a routine check by local law enforcement officers, car enthusiasts re-gather with an unorganized group of show car owners on Bird Road and 87th avenue. 

With thundering bass, custom paint jobs and impressive displays of hydraulic equipment, cars line the parking lot in what appears to be a scene out of this summer's blockbuster movie, "2 Fast 2 Furious." 

Sometimes the cars number in the hundreds and most of their owners are in their late teens and early 20s. Gathering in different locations throughout the area, local businesses complain that the gatherings intimidate customers.

"We have to give a lot of credit [for late movies] because the older customers are afraid to come in," Carolina Benito, assistant manager of the Blockbuster Video located on Bird Road and 107th avenue, said. 

Attempting to unravel the scene, police officers repeatedly tell the group to get in their cars and go home. But to no avail; police officers are forced to issue tickets for loitering or for modifying certain car parts to reach higher speeds. 

"[These gatherings are] just an excuse for teenagers to come here to smoke pot, drink and go drag racing," commented Officer Nancy Garcia of the Miami-Dade County Police Department. 

Although local businesses and police officers find these car groups annoying and sometimes exasperating, car owners say they find no other outlet in which to display their passion for cars.

"The areas available for racing are very limited, so I created a website which will hopefully help us get a place of our own," Steve Reed, a 25-year-old and member of SouthFloridaRacing.com, said.  "A place where we can get together, work on cars and race safely." 

While car enthusiasts hope for new locations to race, police officers blame county officials for the lack of racing locations available for students and racers to gather.  

"The higher-ups haven't built enough locations for kids to race; local areas are much too far for kids to go to," Shahan said.

Although South Florida continues to struggle with the dangers of street racing, several areas throughout the country have attempted to remedy the problem.

Cities in San Diego have changed their laws to target racers and spectators alike.  According to the North County Times, officials are responding to an increase in street racing related deaths by promoting legal racing events and charging street racing spectators with a misdemeanor.  	

The National Hot Rod Association is also taking proactive measures by sponsoring amateur drag racing at raceways in Southern California, according to South Coast Today.  Racing an average of 1,000 cars a day, this association hopes to lower the amount of deaths due to street racing.

According to the Los Angeles Times, police officers in Sonoma, California, are trying to get racers off the streets by offering them a chance to race against uniformed officers in their own squad cars on a quarter-mile strip at a local California speedway. 

They have also tried to battle the trend by passing laws to confiscate cars caught street racing. Spectators of illegal racing face $1,000 fines and six months in jail.  

In the last decade, more than 68,000 teenagers have died in auto crashes, according to the Insurance Group for Highway Safety.

 The number of fatal crashes nationwide attributed to street racing rose to 135 in 2002, from 72 the year before. 

Nationwide statistics show that 49 people are injured for every 1,000 who participate in illegal street racing.

Even though illegal and sometimes dangerous, the fast-paced world of cars, racing and the lack of existing racing spots have some on the hunt for the perfect adrenaline rush. 

According to Scott Selent, a sophomore, biology major at FIU, most street races last only a few seconds but are done mostly for the rush. 

Most street races are random and begin when people challenge each other by nodding their heads or riveting the motor, Selent added. Despite the risk, some FIU student street racers push every boundary of the law and race for the respect and awe of winning. 

"I don't make an appointment to race, but if [the opportunity arises] in the street, I sometimes race," Christian Brocca, a junior, architecture major, said. "It all depends on the conditions though. As you get older, you just forget about racing as much."

Even though local residents and FIU students continually gather and sometimes race, Miami-Dade County police officials say that regardless of the inadequacy of Florida laws, the problem exceeds the department's capacity to control it.

"There isn't much you can do. I don't think that [police] have the manpower to cover an area that is as big as 50 square miles," Shahan said. "On a Friday or Saturday night, squads receive 17 calls a night; they don't have a chance to answer each one."

The university police department feels confident that the University Park Campus and Biscayne Bay Campus are safe from street racers. 

"On campus we don't have this type of racing. The speed bumps located throughout campus are designed to slow people down," Capt. Jesse P. Scott of the University Police Department, said.  "This campus is not a conducive atmosphere for racing...we haven't had any significant problems with racing on campus." 

In an effort to protect students on and off campus, the university police department also partners with local jurisdictions and makes sure that they are on patrol at the appropriate times to combat street racing.

"Kids shouldn't race...the main problem is that parents just want to make their kids happy and they don't realize they are giving their kid a loaded gun-a 3,000 pound car capable of speeds over 140 mph," Shahan said.

Headline: Journalism web magazine explores convergence of print, broadcast, internet
Author: Jennifer Sittig / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The School of Journalism and Mass Communication is linking the media to FIU through a web magazine, FusedOnline, which incorporates print, broadcast and the Internet.

"South Florida is an international pot of culture.  No one is capturing the pulse," said Allan Richards, assistant professor of the SJMC Writing Program.  "This magazine will encourage people to think and make them aware. The website www.FusedOnline.com, which launched June 25, was described by Richards as a "young New Yorker online magazine."

According to Richards,The word "fused" in the title of the magazine, refers to the fusing of print, radio, photography and the multi-cultural experience of living in Miami.

In 2000, a two week lecture was held at FIU on convergence of different multimedia outlets.  Representatives, editors and moguls from the media industry gathered at the symposium to discuss the merge.  Richards drew up a report on such merges and the lecture.  In an attempt to follow in the footsteps of other universities and prompted by Richards' report FIU decided to teach multimedia journalism.

"Newspapers were clamoring for students trained as journalists, not specifically for print or broadcast," said Michael McQueen,  associate professor and chairman of SJMC.

Several courses that would encompass convergence were designed over the course of a year, the final product being a multimedia course in which students would be able to post their material.  According to McQueen, in the spring of 2002 the class met, but lacked funds and resources to get the students' websites hosted onto a server.

The following 2003 spring semester the multimedia class took a field trip to The Sun-Sentinel to view their multi-media desk.  Upon returning, Richards addressed the students and asked them how they felt about doing a start-up magazine.  

Mitch Pellecchia, a senior and now student publisher of the magazine, said, "Can we get a robust response to Mr. Richards?" and was quick to follow with "There can be no slackers on this project."  

"The students, enthusiastic, took over," said Professor Richards.

Pellecchia, having some business background, drew up a plan. The class went to the Student Government Association for funding. SGA awarded them $15,000, which got the website off the ground and allowed them to hire a web designer and hosting firm, Webinnovative, Inc.  One concern of the SGA was whether the online magazine would conflict with The Beacon.

"The Beacon focuses on university issues whereas FusedOnline will focus on issues regarding the greater South Florida area," said Richards. 

The online magazine features international, national and regional media links.  Future funding for the site will come from advertisements and affiliate programs. The hope is to have a bi-weekly publication by fall semester. The website is up, available for viewing, and according to Richards, has gained positive feedback.  

"This is a new magazine that represents the new wave," said Richards.  "It is politically awakening and represents the socially active in South Florida."

Future content of FusedOnline will largely be the effort of students in a course this fall listed as "Online Magazine and Newscast," JOU 4341, but it will also be in the hands of volunteers.  

For more information, contact the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at 305-919-5625 or visit the website www.FusedOnline.com.

Headline: Dunlap to head Arts and Sciences
Author: Angela Castillo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Recently appointed dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Dr. R. Bruce Dunlap, who will officially take office Aug. 1, is succeeding Arthur Herriott who has served as dean of the college for 13 years. 

Dunlap was the most qualified among the 50 candidates who either applied or were nominated for the position, according to Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs. 

"Dr. Dunlap is a visionary, he is committed to quality instruction and research, and he knows how to fundraise," Rosenberg said. He has high energy and a strong work ethic, and above all, he has a national reputation as a biochemist."

Dunlap is graduated from Beloit College with a B.S. in Chemistry and holds a Ph. D. in Chemistry from Indiana University. He is also the Fred M. Weissman Professor of Chemical Ecology at the University of South Carolina and Associate Director for Administration of the USC Nanocenter. And having published more than 150 referred journal articles, his research has received nearly $5 million in support from the American Cancer Society, the National Institute of Health, and the National Science Foundation.

In addition, Dunlap has collaborated with the School of Medicine at USC since 1974, and served as an external consultant of certain academic programs, which gave him the opportunity to visit FIU for the first time. 

Professor and Executive Director of Academic Affairs James Mau said, "I met [Dunlap] in spring 2002 when he came to evaluate [FIU's] chemistry program. His experience as a scientist and as a university administrator made me realize he is more than prepared for the position [of dean]. We were looking for someone that has experience in research and management." 

"I think he will be very good at the position because he brings an appreciation for the other disciplines to move forward and benefit the other departments," Gisela Casines, associate dean of College of Arts and Sciences, said. "I also believe that his years of experience in medical school and his national reputation are a great advantage." 

Dunlap has already identified three main areas that he wants to focus on: faculty development, raising private funds and scholarships, and the creation of multi-disciplinary programs. The last two areas will come together in a "coordinated fashion" in order for students to not only expand their knowledge, but also to build research teams that can compete nationally for funding. 

"I am going to use all my abilities and my 32 years of experience in administration and research to make the best of the College of Arts and Sciences," Dunlap said. "I expect to have an open door policy because I think that the keyword for success is dialogue, it is important to have a dialogue between the office of the dean, faculty, and students."

Some challenges lie ahead for Dunlap. Rosenberg pointed out some of these concerns: to accelerate the growth of graduate programs and the production of Ph.D. graduates, address the budget and enrollment challenges, and continue to foster quality research among the faculty. 

 "Given the years of experience Dr. Dunlap had at the University of South Carolina, and his quality as an individual, he will help to make this university a better place for students, faculty, and staff," Rosenberg said.  "We were very lucky to have found a dean of the caliber of Dr. Dunlap, because Dr. Herriott accomplished so much during his tenure."

Herriott has not only served as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, but also as a Chemistry professor and as an associate dean. 

"I have spent a total of 25 years [in] office, and I think it was time to change for me and the institution. My plans from now on are to take a sabbatical year, and rejoin the faculty next fall 2004," he said.

According to Herriot, his major achievement during his tenure was to establish an Epsilon chapter of "Phi Beta Kappa," which is the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor society. Likewise, he has hired over half of the current faculty members of the College of Arts and Sciences, and he has increased the number of doctoral degrees from four to 12.

"I wish [Dunlap] well, the Arts and Sciences is a strong program that needs to grow and do even better. I hope [the current faculty and alumni] support the new dean and his directions. FIU has tremendous potential, and wonderful opportunities and goals that remain to be achieved," Dr. Arthur Herriott said.

Headline: FIU study abroad goes to film fest
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
Every year, thousands of students, professors, filmmakers, film enthusiasts and even adventurous backpackers flock to a small city in the Czech Republic called Karlovy Vary. They come for the artsy Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, held each year in the quiet spa-ridden town, located about two hours from Prague.

Each summer, FIU offers a study abroad program to the Czech Republic, specifically focusing on the festival in Karlovy Vary. The two-week long program, which entails film lectures in Prague in addition to the attendance of the entire festival (full accreditation included), is run by the director of the Film Studies Certificate program at FIU, Dr.. Barbara Weitz. It's an offshoot of a more extensive six-week program that only covers a small portion of the festival, also headed by Weitz.

I had the wonderful privilege of attending this exciting overseas trip and participated with thousands of other international viewers. This year, the 38th annual Karlovy Vary Festival, held from July 4 to July 12, screened a total of 304 films in 12 cinemas scattered around the tiny city. Of those, I attended about 30 screenings and trust me, 30 screenings of films in nine days really works those butt muscles. The festival was very enriching and although there isn't much to do in Karlovy Vary, the films keep you interested and busy enough, attending four, sometimes five screenings per day.

I watched films from all over the world; from places you never even thought had a film industry, like Uzbekistan, Lithuania, Serbia and Montenegro. I wouldn't have nearly enough space to write about all 30, so I picked three films which really stood out and spoke to me.

Ma camera et moi 
(My Camera and Me)

This French indie jewel is a very inventive and cleverly simple flick about Max, a man who has a strange obsession with video recording all aspects of his daily life from the age of 6 to 36. Subsequently, almost the entire film is shot through Max's hand held cameras, giving the film a very personal touch and making it incredibly realistic while heightening the drama and comedy. The story of Max and his camera is given witty comedy as his first-person documentaries increase in sophistication through his adolescence and adulthood. 

Later, as Max falls in love with a blind masseuse, we see the comedy shed away to a warm layer of Max's emotional side which was severely hindered by his obsession with documenting. It was as if Max's life depended so much on video taping the world that he forgot how to see things through his own eyes and could not properly deal with experiences such as the traumatizing unfaithfulness of his blind lover.

"My Camera and Me"  deserves and will probably receive some U.S. distribution.  Its ingenuity goes unmatched in French cinema and it stands out as a very unique work of art that shined amidst many of the other films at the festival.

Pupendo

This Czech film is a huge hit throughout the Czech Republic and was quite a crowd magnet at the festival.  Jan Hrebejk, whose 2000 film "Divided We Fall" was nominated for an Oscar, directs a tragicomedy that takes place in the early '80s, during the Communist regime in the Czech Republic. 

The film focuses on the life of Bedrich Mara, a sculptor from Prague whose talents are cutoff by communist politics and reduced to menial work, supporting his family by creating ceramic piggy banks. In order to better support his family and try for a well-deserved vacation, Mara accepts a humiliating state commission to sculpt a statue of a communist political leader. Things begin to heat up, as Mara's conscious comes into play with the entire ordeal 

The film and its characters' story are conveyed with a sense of comedy that is used relatively sparingly in the film, giving an otherwise depressing tale, set during dismal times in Czech history, a light feeling that makes you smile. 

Films about this era are very common in Czech cinema, but the themes in "Pupendo"  and the narrative structure are rather unique. The film ends on a higher note that brings bittersweet closure. 

Elephant

American director Gus Van Sant's chilling new work remains my favorite film screened at the festival. "Elephant" follows several Portland high school students into a death trap of mayhem in a film that tries to interpret the unimaginable events that took place at Columbine High School. No dazzling special effects, no trick shots, just the camera following the characters and playing with time as the day at school unfolds into disaster. 

He spends very little quality individual time with the characters so no actual story or conventional plot ever develops, instead the film derives its drama from the sheer horror of the situation, the loud gunshots in quiet hallways, the surprised looks of victims and the eerie Beethoven soundtrack.

The only downfall may come to viewers who are unaware of the incident at Columbine, since this film derives its premise from the tragedy. 

However, viewers should still be able to get the artistic value of this film and understand the commentary on human violence regardless. Look for "Elephant" to open in select U.S. cities on October 10th.

League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, 2 stars

If the dawn of the new millennium is to be remembered in any way, chances are it will be as the time when comic books came to life. These days, there seems to be more new movies based on comic books than classical literature. Therefore, a movie based on a comic book about characters taken from classical literature would appear to be a step in the right direction. 

Director Stephen Norrington once again tries his hand at a comic book-inspired movie. Unfortunately, he doesn't show quite the same enthusiasm with "LXG" as he did with "Blade." 

The year is 1899. Both London and Berlin are suddenly besieged by an armada of tanks, which, by the way, weren't invented until years later, so this was some pretty high-tech stuff. Eager to prevent a world war, England turns to its favorite son, the world-renowned hunter and adventurer, Allan Quatermain. He is immediately inducted into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen under the command of the enigmatic M, who briefs him on the situation. 

Apparently, the attacks were orchestrated by a masked villain who calls himself the Fantom. What's more, all evidence seems to indicate he plans to attack a peace conference in Venice by blowing up the city. 

Alongside the legendary adventurer: master of the deep Captain Nemo, Dracula's ex-lover Mina Harker, invisible man Rodney Skinner, the ageless immortal Dorian Gray, Dr.  Jekyll and the infamous Hyde, and the unexpected addition of U.S. secret agent Tom Sawyer.

I regret to say that although "LXG" is loaded with all that wonderful comic book action we all enjoy, the similarities between the movie and the comic book itself are all too few. But inaccuracies aside, its greatest fault would be that it doesn't pace itself. Everyone and everything is ready to go in the first 15 minutes, giving us very little breathing room; that and too many fight scenes getting in the way. Also, very little character development, which is essential in a good adventure story. LXG leaves a lot to be desired, but as comic book movies go, it's adequate enough to entertain its adolescent watchers who, most likely, will be more interested in its superb special effects anyway.

                                                                     -Joe Martel, Staff Writer



Pirates of the Caribbean, 3 stars

As a "Pirates of the Caribbean" fan since childhood, I was excited to see the filmic version of the classic ride. 

Luckily my high expectations were met with an enjoyable (and surprisingly witty) movie with all the magic of Disney paired up with the explosions of Jerry Bruckheimer. 

With a great balance of humor, action and story, "Pirates" sails past many of this summer's big budget letdowns.  

The plot does a tightrope walk between classic and cliché but gives audiences just enough to stay tuned. Like vanilla ice cream, the story is plain in itself. However, the actors are the best of toppings, making "Pirates" a delectable Sunday. 

Johnny Depp is hilarious as Captain Jack Sparrow. He has found a remarkable way to use his creepiness (or eccentricity, to be more politically correct) to his comedic advantage. Orlando Bloom does not carry this film but deserves credit for making William Turner a good guy without being a repugnant goody-goody. 

The testosterone-heavy cast is beautifully balanced with female lead Kiera Knightly as a pirate-obsessed governor's daughter. She enraptures men with her provocative brown eyes and women with her quest for true love.

This movie sets itself apart from the sequels and hyper-driven competition it faces at the box office. The plot is steady and rises at just the right pace. 

The characters are great. The music is right on track and adds audible atmosphere to the beautiful Jamaican scenery. 

Finally, the film's best quality is its ability to balance the potentially dark subject matter with charm and good taste. As disgusting as pirates can be, the filmmakers make sure that you laugh more than you wince.

"Pirates of the Caribbean" is a great summer film, worth the nine bucks the Cineplex-Nazis charge nowadays because it provides an entertaining and stress-free two hours (and that is hard to come by.) It meets and beats all expectation.

                                                     -Robert J. Gramatges, Staff Writer

K-Os: Exit, 4 stars

K-Os (pronounced chaos), or Kevin Brereton, is lyricist, vocalist and producer all in one. Exit, K-Os' first completed album, is reportedly a project that encompasses the last nine years of his life.  He started out like any other starry-eyed and struggling musician, trying to make a name for himself. He became disenchanted with the current hip-hop scene and began working on Exit which entered earlier this year with the power to blow away much of the mediocrity present in the popular music scene today.

K-Os' style is hard to pin down.  Almost all of the tracks have a jazzy, funky feel.  It's a sort of minimalist approach to the use of space to create emphasis, depth and an uncontrollable bop of the head.

The debut album takes a sharp turn from the cash-money block of hip-hop, where the credentials to become a star lie in an artist's own marketability and how much platinum jewelry he can wear without looking completely uncomfortable on MTV's "Total Request Live."  

What makes this album so solid is K-Os' combination of fresh, inventive lyrics and his ability to smoothly interweave the basics of hip-hop with a variety of contemporary styles.  

All musical aestheticism aside, the prime focus of Exit, according to K-Os, is to advocate a sort of conviction or responsibility to the initial nature of the genre.  Like others before him, K-Os is standing up against the lack of quality hip-hop out there.   

Exit's diversity is definitely one of its strengths, but it's a move that may seem a bit unorthodox to the hardcore fans of hip- hop. Some listeners could argue that it goes against the true nature of genre. 

"Follow Me," sports a slick flamenco guitar hook and finger snaps instead of the traditional hard-biting snare. "Heaven Only Knows" is delivered with hardly any percussive elements and is one of the strongest tracks on the album. "Superstarr Pt. 1" is reminiscent of old raggae/ska, while "Superstarr Pt. 2" is best defined as an acoustic ballad.  

Arranged with a whole cluster of catchy and clever jump-up funk beats, Exit is an intimate portrait drawn through an eclectic mix of experiences and musical styles with an urgent message of awareness to the self, and to the entertainment community.

                                              -Monica Gonzalez, Staff Writer



Big Bad Voodoo Daddy: Save My Soul, 4 stars

1996 was a big year for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy - and swing in general - their appearance in the indie "Swingers" helped launch the career of the zoot suit-wearing septet.  The film also encouraged "swing fever" which seemed to come out of nowhere abruptly, and then fizzled  out just as quickly.  

BBVD was at the center of the big band dance music revival with their 1998 release Americana Deluxe, which remained on the charts for more than a year and whose single "You and Me and the Bottle Makes Three Tonight (Baby)" quickly became one of the nascent swing scene's anthems.  

They crossed from the indie scene to the mainstream in 1999 when they played the halftime show in the Super Bowl.  

While the other hepcats - like The Brian Setzer Orchestra and Cherry Poppin' Daddies - haven't made any waves lately, BBVD is back with their fourth album, proving their resilience in the fickle music industry.

Swing in no longer the "thing" nowadays, but Save My Soul is the money and it just might resurrect rentals of "Swingers" and "Swing Kids" this summer. 

The lineup hasn't changed and they haven't dropped the image, but unlike other bands, they aren't just disguising old fare behind new inserts.

The songs are fresh and feature plenty of jazzy, snazzy solos that give each of the seven members time to really display their talent. 

As usual, Sotty Morris' vocals are at once sexy and enticing, bawdy and loud, and funny - above all he's funny, especially on "Don't You Feel My Leg," in which he assumes the role of a woman he's hitting on.

As fun and infectious as their previous albums, Save My Soul offers great beats for dancing. 

If you caught their performance on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno," you'll know exactly what I mean. The songs, especially when experienced live (or at full blast on the stereo), inspire even the squares to break out their two-tones or bright red lipstick and "jump, jive and wail."

                                                              -Claudia Ortega, Copy Editor
