Headline: Florida native Thomas Chestnutt named new women's soccer coach
Author: Andew Julian / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The women's soccer team will be marching to the beat of a new drum as former Fresno State women's assistant coach Thomas Chestnutt Jr. was named new head coach Feb. 10.

The Florida native said he is excited to be coaching back in his home state.

While at Fresno State, he helped lead the Bulldogs out of the middle of the pack in the Western Athletic Conference to an NCAA tournament berth, the school's second, and its first ever WAC championship in 2005.

"Almost every team I've either played for or coached has been a wining program. I understand what it takes to win," Chestnutt said.

Prior to his tenure at Fresno State, Chestnutt was no stranger to success, having helped the women's soccer team at the University of Florida to a 2001 Final Four appearance and a 2003 NCAA quarterfinal during his stay from 2001-04 as an intern for the team. 

"Winning is an expectation [at UF]," Chestnutt said.

He hopes the same will be expected at FIU within the next few years.

"We want to make it to conference tournament first and then challenge for the conference title," Chestnutt said. "We want to get the program recognized regionally and nationally."

Chestnutt, who is lauded for his abilities as a recruiter, is very excited to get the opportunity to be a head coach close to his home.

Heading in to next season, he believes that the type of players he has will dictate the team's style of play.

"You have to take advantage of what you have," Chestnutt said.

Chestnutt played goalkeeper for three seasons at the University of Dayton, where he earned his B.S. in biochemistry with minors in biology, chemistry and German.

In addition to having an important role in recruiting at Fresno State, the new Golden Panthers coach was in charge of the academic success of the team and he hopes to continue the academic tradition that coach Edwards started.

"I'm not going to be satisfied … we have to get better constantly," Chestnutt said.

For the past 22 seasons, Everton Edwards has been at the helm of the women's soccer program.

After posting 5-12-0 record last season, newly hired athletic director Pete Garcia fired Edwards, electing to steer the program in a new direction. Since 2003, women's soccer has posted a 18-43-7 record. 

In 1985, it was Edwards who started the program, posting a winning record in its inaugural year and doing so 11 more times during his time as head coach. 

Edwards compiled a 165-179-33 overall record while behind the bench for the Golden Panthers.

Headline: Defense and pitching spoils first home opener
Author: Sergio Bonilla and Roberto Cartagena / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Sloppy defense and horrendous relief pitching ruined FIU's (1-4) first home series of the season as they dropped three straight losses to the University of Missouri-Columbia (3-0). 

The three game series which took place Feb. 9 - 11 at University Park Stadium didn't feel like home for Golden Panthers pitchers as they gave up 30 runs over the series.

The Golden Panthers' offensive woes left 11 men on base. 

The lack of timely hitting with men on base against UCF foreshadowed the offensive problems FIU would face in their home opening 3-game series against the Missouri Tigers.



MISSOURI 12, FIU 6

	

The first six innings of the Golden Panthers' home opener was a close battle, which included a second solid start from freshman starter Corey Polizzano (1-1). 

"Wow, that's what you call pitching," manager Danny Price said. "He did everything a freshman should do."

FIU trailed 3-2 entering the top of the seventh inning, and headed to the bottom of the seventh trailing 10-2. 

The Tigers' seven runs in the seventh inning exposed the Golden Panthers' bullpen and sloppy defense. Eric Horstmann was the first relief pitcher to replace Polizzano, but he would only be the first of three relief pitchers to suffer the Tigers' offensive barrage.

"They didn't walk off, they flew off," Price said. "The wheels just fell off."

Although Horstmann recorded two outs, he allowed two hits, three earned runs and two walks, which led to two runs.

The seventh inning began innocently with a ground out by Missouri's Bond Brock. 

A single by first baseman John Mckee followed by a walk to right fielder Ryan Lollis started the Tigers' rally. 

Small ball by the Tigers, coupled with Golden Panthers wild pitches and errors, spawned the huge scoring inning. The Tigers managed to score the seven runs by hitting four singles in the seventh.

The Golden Panthers pitching staff was missing the strike zone frequently throughout the whole game. 

The bullpen's lack of control was one of the main contributors to the game-defining inning as it distributed seven walks and four wild pitches. Poor defense didn't help matters either. 

FIU committed three errors and allowed six unearned runs, which was the difference in the score. In addition, the pitchers became fatigued and were forced to throw more pitches because errors extended the second, seventh and ninth inning. Consequently, the Tigers scored all their runs in those three respective innings. Second baseman Corey Lozano was responsible for two of the three errors.

Horstmann was substituted by relief pitcher Evan Ellison, but Ellison recorded no outs and three unearned runs. 

Relief pitcher James Lajiness ended the rally by striking out Mckee, who had originally led-off the inning.

The momentum shifted in favor of the Tigers following the bow-out seventh inning, but the Golden Panthers late run arrived too late.

Centerfielder Chris Dunn's one out single preceded a Bryan Pullin home run, the first home run for the Golden Panthers this season. 

The Tigers' lead was chipped, but they would respond with two more runs in the top of the ninth to make the Golden Panthers' ninth-inning rally less exciting.

Offensively, the Golden Panthers wasted several opportunities to extend their early lead; the most glaring was in the second inning when the Golden Panthers loaded the bases with no outs and only scored one run. 



MISSOURI 15, FIU 7 



The Golden Panthers looked good early on, in large part due to Dunn's three hits, including two doubles that accounted for three of the Golden Panthers' six runs.

Starter Chris Allen pitched into the fifth inning, giving up three hits and two earned runs.

Senior pitcher Chris Siebenaler relieved Allen after he had loaded the bases. Siebenaler escaped the inning, only giving up a run.

Siebenaler ran into trouble again in the sixth inning when he loaded the bases off of two bunt singles and a hit-by-pitch. 

Price called on newly converted closer Walker Whitley to clean up the mess.

Instead, the opposite happened and Mckee singled in a run that left the bases loaded. 

The very next batter, Ryan Lollis, hit a fastball over the right field fence that gave the Tigers their first lead of the game.

The Tigers retained their lead and scored six more runs in the eighth inning because of some costly errors and timely hitting on their part.

Whitley was tagged for eight runs, two of them earned, in a little over an innings worth of work. Though his ace struggled to find his control, Price stood by his decision to go with the former starter.



MISSOURI 3, FIU 2 



The first two games of the series displayed offensive talents. The series finale exhibited effective pitching from both teams, but the sloppy defense by the Golden Panthers would be the difference in the game again.

"It's never a small set of guys you can blame for losing," FIU starter Jorge Ramos said. "Were a team and we all lose."

Ramos and the Tigers' John Thies pitched effectively using different methods.

Ramos, who pitched the best game of his collegiate career, was at his best when working quickly. 

When pitching continuously, he was throwing more first pitch strikes and putting away hitters easily. 

The Tigers often called time to disrupt his rhythm - including a one-minute delay because one of the bullpen doors opened - and made his control a big problem as two of his five walks led to runs.

Conversely, Thies had little control problems as he walked no hitters. His commitment to throwing strikes led him to allowing six hits in four innings. 

The Golden Panthers were patient against Thies, but never broke through with a big inning. He received a no-decision and Ian Berger was awarded the win, pitching one and two-third innings in relief.

Although Berger was awarded the win, Tigers relief pitcher Kyle Gibson dominated the Golden Panthers the last three innings. 

For the first time in the series, hitters were looking foolish, confused and off-balance. 

Gibson received his first save of the season smoothly - except for one pitch that nearly tied the game.

Pinch hitter Ryan Mollica stepped up to the plate with one out left. 

Gibson's third inning of work caused his pitches to lose movement and Mollica crushed a pitch towards right field. 

The crowd cheered emphatically, but the ball died at the warning track. 

The American flag indicated the wind was blowing towards left-center field.

One unearned run by the Tigers' was the difference in the score. 

The series exploited a young bullpen and unreliable defensive infield. 

The starting pitchers proved they could be successful if limited errors occur behind them. 

Price felt his team performed well against Missouri, who participated in the College World Series last year.

"It's disappointing, but we found out a few things about our team," Price said. "Our bull-pen grew up a little bit today. They finally got rid of the jitters. Our offense is struggling, but we just need to continue to execute the little things."

Headline: Editorial: Too late to fuss over new law building's name
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The name for FIU's College of Law building was made officially at a dedication ceremony Feb. 10. It will be called Diaz-Balart Hall, after Rafael José Diaz-Balart, the grandfather of South Florida congressmen Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart.

The Florida Legislature settled on the name in 2001, when it passed a bill making it official.

It's not clear on what merit Diaz-Balart was picked as the building's namesake, but it's certainly roused some controversy.

Diaz-Balart served under former - and much-reviled - Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. It turns out that no one likes a dictator, so if current dictator Fidel Castro is the most-hated man among South Florida's Cuban exile community, it seems that Batista is the second most-hated.

Thus, the choice of Diaz-Balart's name to appear above the law building's doors has angered many Cuban-Americans, especially the left-leaning ones, including activist Bernardo Benes and founding FIU Professor Anthony Maingot.

But Diaz-Balart is not Batista. Though it's not for us to say whether Diaz-Balart was an honorable man or not, having worked in Batista's government does not say anything about his character, positive or negative. Honorable men have served under dishonorable leaders before. Others have simply questioned the name choice because of Diaz-Balart's lack of relevance to South Florida. He was an important lawyer in Cuba and he served as congressman and minister of transportation there. His contribution to South Florida, though, was minor, aside from having sired a local political dynasty. And his grandson Mario was instrumental in getting the law school state funding, so if he wants the building named after his gramps, so be it.

Besides, any debate about the law school building's name at this juncture is just beside the point. By now, the letters are firmly etched above the building's doors, and they read "Diaz-Balart Hall"

The Legislature gave the hall its name almost six years ago, during the 2001 legislative session. Anyone who has a quarrel with the building's name should have spoken up when the topic was still up for discussion. In fact, they could said something during the six years that have transpired since. 

The building has been inaugurated, dedicated and open for a semester already. Its name is set in stone - literally. Making a fuss about it now is little short of political grandstanding. Noisemakers and rabble-rousers should save their discourse for things they can actually change.

Love it or leave it, it's already named Diaz-Balart Hall.

Headline: GILDED GOAL POSTS: Fees shouldn't pay for stadium
Author: Celine Pelofi / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Welcome to the wonderful world of college. It is the home of independence, freedom, parties and a whole new level of sports-especially football. Fans all across America are even more dedicated to their favorite college football team than they are to professional football.

There has been increasing talk around campus that the stadium at University Park is going to be renovated for the team.  

That seems great.

However, the administration in charge is contemplating increasing our student athletic fees to fund the many renovations that will take place.

The increase of $3 per credit hour per semester would pay for such fabulous ameneties as 14 air conditioned luxury suites and 10,500 more seats.

This has raised many discussions - and even more frustrations - for our student body regarding this matter.

"I would be willing to pay the fee if it was only $5 more a semester. However, we don't necessarily need a new stadium, we already can play at the Orange Bowl, why do we need to build a new one?" said George Leonard, a dedicated football fan.

We already have a sufficient stadium to use. If the University wants to renovate, then they should use the money that they already have instead of acquiring it from us.

Many students have no interest in football or in FIU athletics, and therefore would be outraged if they were forced to pay for something that they felt was ridiculous or unnecessary. 

"I would be mad if I had to pay more because I don't even go to football games. Nobody is really for the Panthers anyway; they are not good yet," said freshman Carla Jimenez. 

Even if they won the championship, we should not be responsible for paying for their elaborate stadium.  

The fame of a successful team alone would bring the University more money and attract more students. Therefore, they would be able to obtain the adequate finances.

Since that is not the case, students are not very enthused about our football team or giving money intended for the stadium for that matter.

Although football may be a life altering hobby that some people cannot live without, I'm quite positive that most students go through their average day without even the remote thought of a ball made of pigskin or the group of guys in sweaty pads running around chasing it.  

They have many other more significant things that they have to worry about.

In addition to studying and home responsibilities, if they do not live in the residence halls, many students sometimes work even two jobs to help pay for expenses.

The last thing that they want is for their hard earned money to go to some new stadium that they will probably never even get to see anyway.

A fancy new stadium would be fantastic, but should it be at the students' expense?

The answer is no. 

The University acquires various forms of revenue, not only from the students, but also from alumni and athletic event tickets. They could also get funding from the state.

Those finances alone should suffice for the building of the new stadium without having to dig into the students' already empty pockets for more money. 

If they can't afford a better stadium, they shouldn't build one until they can.

I understand why some would want to build a stadium. But a largely apathetic student body should not be forced to pay for it.  We have more important things to do with our money.

Headline: Relay for Life raises money for charity
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
More than $29,000 was raised by student organizations, departments and local community members at the FIU Relay for Life, an annual philanthropy event where members from different organizations and groups walk around a track while others members raise money for the fight against cancer.

The 18-hour event took place at the Football Stadium in University Park Feb. 9 - 10 with the opening ceremonies and the Survivor's Victory Lap when cancer survivors walked a lap around the track.

Volunteers from FIU and the South Florida community helped support the event by forming teams and hosting different fundraising activities such as selling food, drinks and materials. The volunteer organizations included fraternities, sororities, academic societies, housing residents and student-run organizations as well as Campus Life organizations such as the Student Programming Council and Panther Rage.

The theme of the 2007 event was "Cirque De Relay." Many teams took advantage of this theme by decorating their tents with colors and material relating to circuses and carnivals.

This year's award for the best decorated tent was awarded to the FIU Accounting Association.

"The main purpose of Relay is to represent the hope that those lost to cancer will never be forgotten and that those who face cancer will be supported, and that one day cancer will be eliminated," said Vanessa Collado, marketing and publicity chair for the Relay for Life committee, in a previous interview with the Beacon.

Event Chair Melissa Gavira said that the motivation behind her involvement in Relay for Life was the camaraderie she saw from students who participated.

"It's the way you get people together for a good cause and it's a campus event, and it gets the FIU community together," Gavira said. "It helps you open up and understand the world better and how to become a better person."

At 9 p.m., a Luminary ceremony was held where candles were lit in honor or in memory of those whose lives have been affected by cancer.

At the end of the event at 8 a.m., Gavira, along with her co-chair Meaghan Garcia, announced the winners of various awards. The Undergraduate Studies Office at FIU was named the number one fundraising team.

The Elba family were awarded second place for raising the most money - $5000.

The Spirit Award was awarded to the Social Workers Association.

Relay for Life is a year-round event that is continuously raising money for the American Cancer Society in order to provide for patient services, trainings and research.

Money is raised nationwide in different ways, whether it is through bake sales, car washes, canning (fundraising money at street intersections) or accepting donations.

According to Gavira, the Relay for Life committee had set a goal of $70,000 before August 2007.

Before Relay for Life, they managed to raise around $24,000, most of it coming from online donations through the American Cancer Society website. After Relay for Life, the amount raised adds up to roughly $58,000, just $12,000 shy of their target.

In previous years the event gathered 96,000 participants in Florida and 3 million worldwide

The concept of Relay for Life began in 1985 when a doctor walked 83 miles on a local track for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer Society.

The American Cancer Society's Relay for Life is a nationwide signature activity, the single largest non-profit event in the world.

Headline: Center cares for students' kids
Author: Christina Veiga / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
She may only be four years old but Alexis Tallon, like her mother, Tiffani Tallon, is already a full-time student. The difference is, while her mother works towards earning her business degree, Alexis works on her verbal and cognitive skills at the Children's Creative Learning Center at University Park.

Since 1975, the CCLC has been dedicated to providing early childhood education to FIU students who have children of their own. Although the center is also open to children of FIU staff and alumni, as well as to community members, the programs are designed "primarily for students," according to Silvia Valdes, coordinator and Administrative Services representative for the center.

Currently, the center offers a full-time program for toilet-trained children from two-and-a-half to six years of age. Drop-off begins at 7:45 a.m., and pick-up begins at noon.

Throughout the day, children are encouraged to think critically and express themselves by means of developmental tasks and exposure to a variety of different content areas.

According to Valdes, to help work around students' busy schedules, the center also launched a new program this Spring semester. The Educare/Flex-Time program allows more options for parents who may not have classes at FIU everyday, or whose children are not ready to begin school full-time.

Under the new program, parents are able to enroll their children for daycare in two-hour blocks. The earliest block is from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and the latest block is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Next Fall semester, the center will relocate to the Graham Center and will offer hands-on indoor and outdoor activities.

The center's tuition varies but the average cost for students is $378 monthly, plus a one-time $125 registration fee, and an $85 supply fee. 

For faculty, staff and community members, there is a $650 monthly tuition fee, as well as a one-time registration and supply fee of $125.

The Educare/Flex-Time program for enrolled students is $6 per hour.

Apart from convenience and flexibility, the CCLC also offers over $200,000 in scholarships to Pell Grant eligible students. This financial aid allows students to pay a subsidized fee of $189 a month for full-time care, $3 an hour for the Educare/Flex-Time program, and take advantage of the program's free lunches.

Out of the 17 FIU students whose children are enrolled in the center, 14 receive financial aid. The center is also qualified to offer Voluntary Pre-kindergarten, a program in which the state of Florida offers three hours of free schooling to parents who complete an application process.

But for Tallon, the financial assistance and convenience offered by the center pale in comparison to what the center has offered her child Alexis.

"I know she is getting the attention she deserves when she comes home and says 'Mommy, they love me there,'" Tallon said

For senior Zoraida Villanueva, it was the education provided by the CCLC that convinced her to enroll her three year old daughter, Janellyzi Telles.

"The schooling here is incomparable. I've also learned a lot about early childhood education through the workshops and social events [that the CCLC hosts]," Villanueva said.

According to Janice Lopez, assistant director of the center, the program works to foster the communicational and cognitive skills through activities such as indoor and outdoor play, cooking, art and science.

"We offer a lot of things outside of childcare. We work a lot with the child as a whole," Lopez said.

The program currently has a waiting list, but vacancies open as students graduate or children move from one age group to the next.

Because of safety issues, students must be enrolled at FIU to use the center's services.

Headline: Law building officially opened
Author: Alejandra Ramirez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Spectators cheerfully gathered outside the Pharmed Arena at University Park Feb. 10. Having spent their morning enjoying a complimentary breakfast and touring the new College of Law building, they waited eagerly for the doors to open and the show to begin.

The College of Law's dedication ceremony was the final step towards the school's completion after it received full accreditation last December.

The ceremony began with an introductory speech by the school's dean, Leonard Strickman, and continued smoothly to include various speeches, all of which commemorated the building and the hard work it took to make it a reality.

One of the speakers was U.S. House Representative, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, grandson of the late Rafael Diaz-Balart, for whom the building is named after.

"This whole thing has just been such a labor of love for so many," Balart told The Beacon. "Those horrible days, months and years we had where we thought we had a law school and then it just got taken away - the legislature just kept playing with us. But so many people believed in us … and the stars just aligned for us and we were able to get it turned around."

After finally getting accredited, naming the building became another controversy. Seeing how much Lincoln Diaz-Balart and his brother, Mario Diaz-Balart, fought for a public college of law in Miami, legislators felt it was only right to name the college's building after their grandfather. Controversy arose when many found out that Rafael Diaz-Balart had been the former father-in-law of Fidel Castro.

However, ties between the two families had been broken long ago. 

The ceremony concluded with a speech from keynote speaker Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a U.S. Supreme Court associate justice.

"Lawyers require interdisciplinary legal skills and values, and to have a school where so many can learn these skills is great," Ginsburg said during the lecture.

Ginsburg's speech silenced the room and for the fifteen minutes she spoke, everybody seemed in awe.

"Even with all the legal homework I had during this period, I said yes to coming," Ginsburg said. "It's a great law school."

Quoting writers such as Shakespeare and Charles Dickens in the dislike for lawyers, Ginsburg rebutted their arguments saying, "in my opinion, it takes a successful lawyer to speak plainly and write clearly and you've got that here." 

The importance and uniqueness of the law school was further emphasized when Ginsburg acknowledged the percentage of Hispanic students enrolled at the law school. 

"You have the highest proportion of Hispanic [students] in all the United States, 42 percent," Ginsburg said. "The benefits of a diverse student population are not theoretical but real."

Ginsburg's speech concluded several days of celebrations held in honor of the new College of Law. Another event included a dinner with Gov. Charlie Crist at the Biltmore Hotel Feb. 9.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column: Oscar-winning formula as simple as 'going ugly'
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This year, Martin Scorsese will be a sixth-time contender in the Academy Award's best director category. His nomination for his blistering and violent masterpiece The Departed represents his best chance at finally winning that elusive golden man.

If Scorsese loses again Feb. 25, the only thing left would be to go and direct a war epic in Hebrew about a deaf, mute and blind genius overcoming drug abuse while singing about it. Considering that technique has worked with almost every Oscar-winning film or performance in the past, it wouldn't be a surprise if he pulled it off.

Here's how to pick this year's winners like an Oscar guru:

Oscar voters like to use their hearts rather than their brains when they vote. If you want an Oscar, don't make a comedy or a science-fiction film - and for God's sake, never make something smart and witty. No westerns either ­- unless you're Clint Eastwood. In that case, you can fart your way to an Oscar nomination.

Almost every film that wins the Best Picture Oscar is either one of the following: an emotional whopper, an "important message" film, an epic, a musical or a biopic. Any combination of the above gets your film bonus points with the Academy.

In fact, if you take a look back at every Best Picture winner, it's hard not to find a trend. Notice a variation from the aforementioned categories in the last 10 Best Picture Oscar winners: six epics, one musical, two message films, one biopic … and American Beauty (1999). In the race this year, The Queen, Babel and Letters from Iwo Jima all fill the Oscar bait role. The best two films of the group are outside the norm, however: The Departed is the crime film whereas Little Miss Sunshine is the feel-good film. However, this year, both these films seem to have the upper hand. Let's see what happens.

If you're up for Best Actor at the Oscars, odds are good if your leading man is mentally or physically challenged, a real life person, a villain or a larger-than-life character. Bids are doubled if any of them die tragically. In the Best Actor group, we have triple-threat Forest Whitaker playing a villain, a real-life figure in larger-than-life role in The Last King of Scotland. Maybe voters will vote for him three times. 

His competitors aren't far behind with Ryan Gosling playing a drug addict, Peter O'Toole playing a dying man, Leonardo DiCaprio playing an anti-hero and Will Smith playing a real person.

In the last 15 years alone, physically/mentally handicapped or sick characters have won seven times. Out of the other eight, four have been villains, two have been tragic, larger-than-life characters and the other two have been Holocaust victims (always a plus with the Academy!).

On the other hand, if you're female and want to win a Best Actress Oscar, going ugly is the best way to go. Either that, or of course, go with a historical figure. Take a look at Hilary Swank, Charlize Theron, Halle Berry and Julia Roberts. They all went the ugly route and/or played biographical roles. This year's nominees bring back the same formula with Helen Mirren as the Queen of England, Meryl Streep as a villain and Judi Dench as just ugly.

For the supporting actor/ actress categories, it also helps if you scream, cry or play the long-suffering wife. Being a cute kid helps, too.

Out of the 20 acting nominees this year, 19 can be classified under the Oscar norm of typically nominated roles. So despite the nominees being the most diverse in years, the same roles tend to be rewarded again and again.

And finally, back to Scorsese. After struggling all these years to please his detractors and critics with films that scream Oscar (Gangs of New York and The Aviator), he decided that enough is enough and returned to the stuff that made him a legend - the crime drama. Perhaps it's his return to his roots that will grant him the notorious statuette after all these years.

Headline: BABY TALK: Infant Lab research uses observations to understand child development
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Ever strolled through Deuxieme Maison one sunny afternoon and passed by the mysterious sign "Infant Development Laboratory?" Well if you haven't, the lab is located in DM 115 and, much like its name suggests, the lab deals with infants.

"We conduct research on infants 2 to 10 months old," graduate student Melissa Shuman, an infant lab employee, said. "We observe how they perceive objects and sound and how they learn the world around them."

The federally funded non-profit lab, directed by psychology professor Lorraine E. Bahrick, was founded in 1984 and has conducted research on more than 10,000 infants in various studies. All of the research conducted on the infants is completely non-invasive Rather, most of the research is done through pure observation.

And for the parents afraid to leave their baby's side, they get to remain with their child throughout the usually 20-minute testing process. 

In the lab, a special table is set up with two television sets for an infant to watch. Above each television are two peepholes for observers to see how the infant reacts to whatever is on the screen.

While holding what appears to be a video game controller, the observers are trained to look for changes in the infant's demeanor and press the correlating button on their controller.

"We have reliable and unreliable observers," Shuman said.

The reliable observers are actually those who have gained enough experience observing infants to accurately rate their demeanor. Senior Samantha March is one of those observers.

"I find watching the babies a bit entertaining," March said. "The fulfilling part is seeing how much we underestimate how infants are able to detect differences in their environment that adults take for granted."

By comparing the data the observers input with the controllers to what was shown on the TV screen, researchers determine how different stimuli affect the infants.

The stimuli in question happen to be footage of FIU students. If you have ever enrolled in an Intro to Psychology class at FIU, then you would have had to participate in Experimetrix, an online experiment scheduling system. Essentially, the website has students participate in various studies, and at times Experimetrix would direct students to the Infant Lab.

When I went to the Infant Lab that first time as a freshman, Shuman had me recite "Hickory Dickory Dock" many times. In addition to saying the rhyme I also had to say it with a hat on. This was to see how an infant would react to a person saying the same thing, but looking a little different. And so I was recorded and the best performance I gave was looped over and over again.

Any data collected by someone not considered to be reliable is not used in any study, but it is used to evaluate the observer over time, which in turn should lead to the observer becoming reliable or rather, experienced enough to evaluate the infant's expressions properly.

After the observations are completed, infants receive a certificate of appreciation from FIU for their time. Parents will receive a letter detailing what was found in the study involving their baby.

Currently, the Infant Development Laboratory is working on a big project with the University of Miami to find a way to detect autism at an earlier stage of infant development. In association with the Center for Autism and Related Diseases, the Infant Lab hopes to make some leeway in that area of research. For more information on the Infant Lab, visit infantlab.fiu.edu.

Headline: Sharpton main speaker at BSU event
Author: Christina Lemus / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Though Vanessa Robinson, vice president for the Student Programming Council at the Biscayne Bay Campus, hopes all FIU students will attend Al Sharpton's lecture at BBC, she hopes minority students in particular will walk away with at least one piece of advice: that everyone should be able to succeed in the business world no mater the race.

Sharpton's lecture will deal with concepts in empowerment. Sharpton will also discuss social issues among minorities.

The event will take place Feb. 23. His lecture will be one of many events taking place as a part of the Third Annual 2007 Black Student Union Conference, which will be from Feb. 22 through Feb. 24. 

"Expect the most dynamic conference in the south eastern region of the [United States]. Sharpton is the perfect speaker for the event," said William Hatcher, president of BSU.

Hatcher said the conference's theme, which is aimed to "empower students academically, socially, and spiritually," was created by BSU and later brought to the Civil Rights activist, author and former Democratic candidate for president in order to further develop the theme during his lecture.

"Sharpton is a prominent speaker in the black community and will help address human rights and empowerment issues in a dynamic way," Hatcher said.

The BSU has worked with the Student Government Council at BBC and SPC-BBC to help co-host the event. Both organizations helped BSU to allocate funds that in turn helped bring Sharpton and the conference as a whole to BBC.

Hatcher believes having Sharpton as a speaker at BBC during the month of February will bring more attention and programming to BBC as well as attract more students to the events. 

"BSU planned the BSU Conference for the Spring semester so that it would take place during February's Black History Month and hopefully bring more students to the conference," Hatcher said.

Students do not have to be a member of BSU in order to attend the conference. In fact, the conference, which will include Sharpton's keynote address, will be open to FIU students of all races and ethnicities. The reason for this is because the conference, according to Leatrice Gachette, Pan-African chair of SPC-BBC, will aim to primarily help minorities achieve their goals. The conference will also discuss issues and tips dealing with volunteering and how to live a healthy lifestyle, themes that would apply to anyone.

"The conference will aim toward areas of knowledge deficiencies for minorities and will help students to overall improve their life," Gachette said.

Tickets for the events are free for FIU students; however, spaces are limited so students must register to attend the events.

Registration packets are available at the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services located at the Graham Center, room 216 of University Park or in the Wolfe University Center, room 253. Non-FIU students are open to the event at a registration cost of $35.

LUNCH SPECIAL

North Miami appeals to a variety of pallets and spenders but as a student you may not always have the time or money to sit down in a restaurant for a couple of hours.  

Welcome to At the Bay's Lunch Special where we'll take you to places you may not have known about around campus. It'll take you three to five minutes to get there but you'll be back to class before you know it-with a full stomach.



CHEEN-HUAYE



Marco Velasquez, the owner of Chéen-huaye spent over a year studying dishes served in Southern Mexico, as well as tasting and cooking so many of the delectable dishes he serves. 

Located on 151st Street, across the Biscayne Bay Campus entrance, Chéen-huaye's varied menu adds credence to that statement.

Established last October, the restaurant has already garnered attention from the Miami Herald and the New Times for its exceptional menu, expanding on what is normally served at your typical Mexican restaurants.

Though the expected fajitas, burritos and quesadillas appear on the menu, the rest is made up of Yucatan specific dishes, such as cochinita pibil (piglet marinated in recado rojo and baked in plantain leaves), a rice and milk drink mixed with sugar, vanilla and cinnamon known as horchata; and sopa de lima, or lime soup, made with shredded chicken, tomato, peppers, and of course, limes.

When you walk into the restaurant, the first thing that stands out is the intimacy of the location. 

Hidden in the far end of a plaza, the restaurant property is small, with half a dozen chairs inside and several more outside.

Though its size is small, the place itself is comfortable, a great location to go with a date or a group of friends and sit at the bar facing the kitchen and a fair selection of wines.

The food is just as good as the aesthetics that surround it.  During a fairly short wait time you can enjoy their homemade chips and salsa.

Prices of entrees were reasonable, between $4 to $7 appetizers and $9 to $12 entrees. 

They also serve Mexican beer, wine, margaritas and homemade sangria. 

What will keep bringing you back, however, is their lunch menu with entrees at $7.95 before 3 p.m.



JERUSALEM 

MARKET & DELI



Down the street is another hidden treasure: the Jerusalem Market & Deli.  This delicious secret has been kept by FIU students for over a decade. 

Tucked away in the corner of Biscayne Bay Blvd. and 162nd Street, the deli specializes in serving authentic Lebanese cuisine as well as selling goods from Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and parts of the Middle East.

Established 11 years ago by Sam Elzoor, the market's upbeat and sociable owner, and has been kept alive by word of mouth and customer loyalty.

Avoiding all but the most simple of ads, the existence of the Deli has been passed from student to student like a well-kept secret. 

The selection of the canned goods and spices on their shelves impresses as they stock many things that wouldn't be normally found on American stores.  There are also refrigerators full of drinks, ranging from your typical brand of soda to imported Israeli juices with bright foreign labels. 

Next to the serving area, they have a deli-style fridge displaying the many different meats and cheeses that they have, some difficult, if not impossible to find at your local deli. The food is served cafeteria-style, having you go up, order, and take your food back to your seat.

Rice and black beans mix together with eggplant and lamb with mixed vegetables to make a delectable mix of Eastern and Western tastes. I also recommend the kibe, a large round croquette filled with meat; fried to perfection.

The entire menu is stays below the $10 mark for plates. The family friendly-feel is what'll keep this reporter coming back.

The Beacon did not pay for food. Owners had no knowledge of reviewer's purpose.
