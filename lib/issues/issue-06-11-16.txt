Headline: Past and present Golden Panthers garner attention
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
With the induction of the first class of the FIU Hall of Fame looming, it is fitting to have three other Golden Panthers receive some kind of national attention:

• Former soccer standout Bobby Boswell was named to Major League Soccer's Radio Shack Best XI. The best 11 players in the MLS are determined by voting from the MLS players, MLS coaches and general managers, and media. 

The current D.C. United defender was also named 2006 MLS Defensive Player of the Year three weeks ago in just his second year in the league. 

Boswell, who has played every minute in 30 games for D.C. this season, was also selected to the start MLS All-Star game this past August.

Boswell joins Robin Fraser, Steve Ralston and Greg Vanney as one of four former Golden Panthers to be named to the team the MLS Best XI.

•   Former safety Nick Turnbull became the first FIU football player to play in an NFL game. 

The undrafted rookie free agent was promoted from the Atlanta Falcons' practice squad and played on special teams for their Nov. 12 showdown against the Cleveland Browns.

Turnbull holds the football team's all-time interceptions record with 16. His five interceptions in 2004 is the single-season school record.  

• Freshman Olga Vegun was named Sun Belt Conference Player of the Week for the week ending Nov. 12. The native of Ukraine becomes the third women's volleyball player to receive the honor this season, joining freshman Yarimar Rosa and junior Keila Oliveira.

Vergun recorded 16 kills, with a season-high .786 hitting percentage, in a win against Troy Nov. 10. She then added 10 more kills in win against South Alabama Nov. 12.

Headline: Football team still winless after loss to Warhawks
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the Golden Panthers the Nov. 11 meeting with Louisiana-Monroe was the game that was circled on the schedule. That was the game that would end the eight-game losing streak and give the Division I-A newcomers their first win as a full-fledged program. 

Coach Charlie Weatherbie and his 1-7 Warhawk squad had other ideas.

In front of 15,009 eager fans, FIU (0-9, 0-4) was dominated from the start and fell for the ninth time this season to a lowly Monroe (2-7, 1-4) side 35-0 at FIU Stadium. 

Coach Don Strock's team had started the season off well, with the possibility of many of the initial outcomes going either way. However, over the last three games the Golden Panthers have been outscored 108-3 including two shutouts. The game marked the first time the team had been shutout at home.

"We didn't do very well blocking people offensively or tackling defensively," said Strock. "That's what I told them at the beginning of the game, halftime and after the game."

ULM dominated from the start, taking their initial drive 79 yards against a flaky FIU defensive unit and scoring on a 31-yard touchdown run from tailback Calvin Dawson. 

With 5:19 to play in the first quarter things got worse for the Golden Panthers as quarterback Josh Padrick, who has struggled to find his way this season, was intercepted by defensive back Chaz Williams and the turnover was returned 26 yards to put the visitors up 14-0. 

The Golden Panthers, despite having three players return from suspension and one from injury, including tailbacks Julian Reams, A'mod Ned and full back John Ellis, managed just 10 net yards rushing on the night and trailed 21-0 at the half thanks to a three-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Chance Payne to tight end Mitch Doyle with 5:43 to play in the first half.

FIU did not seem to use the break as inspiration and came out flat offensively to start the second half. Monroe took advantage and less than three minutes into the second half Weatherbie took a gamble offensively. 

Wide receiver Darrell McNeal took a toss from Payne and then faked the run, pulling the ball back and firing down field to a wide-open LaGregory Sapp at the 10-yard line. Sapp, walking backwards as he caught the ball, turned and walked untouched into the endzone, extending the lead to four touchdowns.

The Warhawks then put any chances of a comeback away with 4:23 to play in the third quarter as Dawson, who managed 132 yards on 23 carries, punched in his second and Monroe's final score, this time from two yards out. 

"We had some opportunities to score towards the end," Strock said, "and we did not cash in on them. We tried a lot of different ways to establish the run and we didn't get it done. We will take a hard look at the film and make the changes that need to be made."

Padrick, missing the presence of suspended wide out Chandler Williams and tight end Samuel Smith for the second week in a row, completed 18 of 30 passes for 179 yards and the interception. Backup Paul McCall relieved Padrick late in the contest, finishing the night one of six for 21 yards.  

The pitiful run game, which seemed to struggle from the Warhawk pressure on the offensive line and a lack of originality in play calling, was led by Ned with 26 yards on 8 carries. 

Freshmen Jeremy Dickens and John Houston Whiddon led the way receiving, gaining 75 and 45 yards receiving respectively on five catches each.

FIU, which coming into the game led the nation in tackles for a loss at 8.88, managed six and were led defensively by senior linebackers Alexander Bostic III, James Black and Keyonvis Bouie.

With 11 tackles Bouie finds himself 14 short of the school record with three games left to play.  

FIU managed to convert just two out of 12 third downs and were forced to go for it on fourth down on three occasions late in the game, all resulting in a turnover. 

Along with Dawson, the ULM offense was run by Payne, who in relief for an injured Kinsomon Lancaster, passed for an economical 110 yards on 10 of 11 passing with a touchdown. 

Following Stanford's shocking 20-3 win over Washington Nov. 11, FIU (0-9) and Duke (0-10) find themselves as the only Division I-A teams still looking for a win.

The Golden Panthers will look for their first victory of the season Nov. 18 as they square off with the University of Louisiana-Lafayette at FIU's homecoming. Kickoff is set for 6 p.m. at FIU Stadium.

Author: Magaly Estrella / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers are 21-10 in home openers and history was definitely on their side Nov. 12 at the Pharmed Arena. 

FIU crushed non-conference foe Barry University 69-36 and dominated the Buccaneers in every aspect, including field goals; 45.8 percent to 26.9 and out rebounded the Buccaneers 46-25.

Junior LaQuetta Ferguson led FIU with a game high 16 points and also added six assists and steals. Ferguson covered the floor, scoring from beyond the arc and staying focused on fast break opportunities. In the first four minutes of the game, Ferguson scored six of her team's eight points.  

"I just let the game come to me; I stayed in the flow… I got a lot of steals and fast breaks; the coach told me to get in the pass lane and get easy buckets… and that's what I did," Ferguson said.

Sophomore Iva Ciglar went 5 for 9 from the floor and was 3 for 6 from the 3-point range. With four minutes left in the first half, FIU got its first comfortable lead of the game when Ciglar made a three pointer, helping FIU go up 26-10. After a foul by Ferguson on center Alexandria Fernander, and steal and lay-up by the Barry center, the score was all of a sudden 26-19.

On FIU's next possession, Ciglar scored another 3-pointer that put Barry away for good; the Golden Panthers didn't look back as they pulled away farther and farther.  Ciglar scored 13 points including five assists and a game-high seven steals. 

Second team preseason All-Sun Belt senior center Lasma Jekabsone led the game with 12 rebounds and four blocks. However, Jekabsone struggled offensively going 2 for 7 from the floor. In her first game as a starter, guard Monika Bosilj had four rebounds and three steals; the young freshman will be seeing a lot of starting action this year.

"We put our best players on the floor…we've had a lot of injuries at her position and she is a very good player, I think she has earned that starting position for right now," assistant coach Desm Thomas said.

It was a close game through most of the first half, until Bosilj scored a 3-pointer with 8:36 to go until halftime; her basket started a 10-2 run to put the Golden Panthers up 26-16. 

At halftime, FIU enjoyed their first commanding lead of the game, 35-21. At the start of the second half, Barry had not lost their intensity.

Barry ran the court well, showing no signs of distraction or fatigue. Even after being down by as much as 30 points, Barry still hustled for the ball and played under control. However, FIU's strong defense limited the Buccaneers to just one field goal over the final 10 minutes of the game; the three point basket came within the last 16 seconds of the game. 

Bosilj started yet another fast break run when she scored off a lay-up with 9:45 left in the game; her basket turned into 15 unanswered points for FIU.

"We had a lot of steals and lay-ups … I think if we could count on those things, and we are aggressive on defense … we have a quick team, so if we can just get out on the floor and run, we'll be very effective," Thomas said. 

This weekend the women's basketball team will participate in the KCRG-TV9 Hawkeye Challenge in Iowa City, Iowa. FIU will host Florida A&M on Friday at 6 p.m. 

"Florida A&M is a very athletic team … we're doing some good things; we're getting better with our fast breaks and our plays but we need to work on our rebounding; we're going to do a good job, we're going to get them prepared to play Florida A&M," Thomas said.

Headline: Volleyball ends season with three game win streak
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When Jean McCarthy, the Troy University outside hitter served up three consecutive aces to secure a first set win for her team, the once frenzied home crowd at Pharmed Arena was forced to sit down dejected.

However, that early letdown was all the Golden Panthers needed to get fired up as they went on to win the match 3-1 (27-30, 30-16, 30-22, 30-14) in Sun Belt Conference action Nov. 10.

Following that win, the Golden Panthers went on to beat South Alabama 3-0 (30-20, 30-19, 30-12) in the final game of the season Nov. 12. Their 22-7 mark for the year is the best record since the move to Division I play back in 1987.



FIU 3, TU 1



After jumping out to an 11-6 advantage to force a Trojan time out, everything went downhill for the Golden Panthers in the opening set. The Trojans had a renewed supply of energy and the stagnant Golden Panthers could only watch as they opened a 23-18 advantage en route to winning game one.

From that point on, the Golden Panthers were nothing short of dominant. The usual assassins- freshman outside threat Yarimar Rosa, consistent hitter Arasay Guerra and the versatile Olga Vergun - all stepped up their level of play to power the Golden Panthers.

Despite getting the win, Golden Panthers Head Coach Danijela Tomic expected to see more intensity from her team.

"I am not very happy with the way that we played tonight, especially in the first game. I think we came in the game totally unprepared and we underestimated Troy University," Tomic said. "After the first game I told them forget it and do the things that they know how to do. The difference is that we just started playing and that's why we pulled it off." 

Rosa finished with a match high 20 kills at a .500 clip; Vergun was lethal with 16 kills at a blistering .789 clip, and Guerra chipped in with 15 kills in the win.

Lizz Leeds had 16 kills, and Meghan Gilroy added 12 for the Trojans who fell to 9-23 on the season, and just 3-13 in Sun Belt action.

"We played a quality team and we are not as talented as them so we have to out-work teams," said Trojans head coach Sonny Kirkpatrick. "If we don't come out with that intensity needed then it is easy for us to end up on the bottom half of the score," he said.



FIU 3, SA 0



On senior day at FIU, the Golden Panthers appeared to be a much more experienced team as they picked apart South Alabama. Rosa and Guerra led the way with 12 kills each, and Vergun added 10 in the season ending victory. 

Principal setter Keila Oliveira had 18 assists, and senior Dyionna Smith had a match high 20 assists along with 8 digs and 5 kills at on .833 hitting. Lauren Robins had 7 kills, and Kalyn Hundley had just 7 digs for South Alabama who the Golden Panthers held to a dismal .071 hitting percentage. With their 14-3 Sun Belt mark, the Golden Panthers ended up in a three way tie for first place with Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky and will be the third seed when the Sun Belt tournament gets underway Thursday at North Texas.

"I told the team not to underestimate anybody. We want to go into the tournament with a lot of confidence and do well," said Tomic.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Columbia incident threatened freedom
Author: Joseph Salzverg / Freshman / Business Major
&nbsp;
I enjoyed Juan Camilo Estrada's piece on the Columbia riot for the sole fact that I learned of the issue. However, I could not ignore the bias of the article.

Freedom of speech is one of the greatest things this country has to offer. But when a group of adults mob a stage during a speech, it is no longer about voicing your point, but a matter of safety.

Gilchrist and his colleagues were frightened, as they ought to be. Storming a presentation does nothing but cast a shadow on your association and drown out your intended message.

If anybody was allowed to storm a stage, then what is stopping other dangerous alliances from disrupting - and potentially harming - unions of people gathered for anything from a presidential rally to a dance recital?

The first amendment is a glorious one, and it should be protected. We should call the incident for what it is: a disruption that could have been a disaster.

Headline: Bush must cooperate with Democrats
Author: Chris Cabral / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the glorious aftermath of the 2006 midterm elections, people are looking to this new Congress to take action and restore balance to their government. Although the Democrats have bold plans, the question is will Bush be willing to compromise?

The Democrats have an ambitious agenda, and the first order of business will be to raise the minimum wage. The new and improved Democratic congress plans to pass legislation to expand college tuition assistance, increase port security, repeal tax breaks for oil companies and allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices - and that's just the plan for the first 100 hours. Of course, George W. Bush can still obstruct these long overdue measures and veto every change the Democrats try to make. 

These next two years will either be the dawn of a new era of bipartisan cooperation, or they will be a last testament to the President's stubbornness. It's entirely up to him. 

He could either choose to work with the current majority and make some concessions and compromises in the wake of his party's recent defeat, or he can go down with the sinking ship of his failed presidency. 

President Bush has pledged to bring both parties together before. He has promised to treat those with whom he disagrees with respect, though throughout his presidency, these words have amounted to nothing more than hollow gestures. 

No doubt Karl Rove, and other relentlessly ruthless members of his administration, will push him to veto every bill that arrives at his desk. That way, they won't allow the Democrats to get much done and they can tar them with the same "do-nothing" brush with which their Republican comrades in Congress were painted failures. 

They could submit far-right proposals that they know the Democrats would never support - bills that may call for the clear-cutting of forests with cheerful and misleading titles like the "Happy Forests Act of 2007" - and with every rejection, they could call the Democrats too partisan.

Yet that could backfire. In fact, while it would be bad for the country, Bush's endless use of his veto powers could drive home the points Democrats have been trying to drive home about this President and most of his party for years.

If Bush vetoes the minimum wage increase on the grounds that it will hurt businesses and corporations, Americans will know where modern Republican priorities lie.

If he vetoes proposals to repeal tax breaks to big oil, Americans know the modern G.O.P.'s true priorities.

Veto after veto, he'll have to explain why the Republicans oppose increasing financial aid for college students, or why he doesn't want to expand access to health care.

In the long run, that could hurt the Republicans almost as much as it hurts the American people. 

I hope Bush will choose to work with the Democrats and the sensible, moderate members of his own party.

If not, candidates from both parties will be running against his legacy in 2008, and voters will remember what happens when they elect a far-right, regressive Republican for president.

Headline: Skydiving group entertains at game
Author: Naihobe gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU football fans will see action in the sky as well as on the field during the Nov. 18 Homecoming game. Fifteen minutes before kickoff, the Army's renowned Golden Knights Parachute Team will sky dive out of an airplane onto the FIU football field.

The idea to bring the Golden Knights to FIU came to Captain Oscar Rubio, an instructor for the FIU ROTC program, when he learned that the group would be coming to Miami to entertain crowds at the NASCAR Ford 400 race Nov. 19. 

Cadet Evelyn Vasquez in the FIU ROTC program has helped organize the effort to bring the Golden Knights to FIU.

"The Golden Knights do all sorts of jumps using things like flares and sparkles, which is probably what we'll be seeing at the game since it's going to be dark," she said.

According to the Golden Knights website, the group first formed in 1959 to represent the U.S. Army in international skydiving competitions.

Vasquez called the Golden Knights one of the best parachuting teams in the nation.

The group, which is comprised of the most talented jumpers in the Army, has won 400 national championships and over 60 international championships.

They perform various aerial demonstrations, including tandem jumps, in groups of eight or fourteen. Tandem jumps join divers mid-air in a variety of shapes, such as stars and circles, with flags, banners, lights and colored smoke. 

Twelve thousand feet in the air, at speeds up to 120 miles per hour, jumpers have wowed over 12 million people by cutting parachutes, passing batons, and performing other aerial acrobatics.

"We think they're going to be a great way to celebrate ROTC's anniversary and recognize our veterans," Vasquez said.

This year marks the 10th  anniversary of the ROTC program at FIU, and the Golden Knights' visit will serve to commemorate members of the FIU military community in addition to entertaining football fans.

"After the show, we're going to recognize seven cadets that have served our country in combat in either Operation Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom," Vasquez said.

In addition to an official recognition coordinated by ROTC in conjunction with the Homecoming Committee, the athletics department will also allow fans with a military ID to attend the game for free.

 Family members can attend at a reduced ticket price of $5.

According to Rubio, there was no cost involved in bringing the high-profile parachuting team to FIU. 

"It is something we thought would be cool," said Wolfgang Acevedo, football game chair for the Homecoming Committee.

He added that there is a possibility the collaboration with ROTC could be extended into future years.

"It is the discretion of the Football Game Chair for the events going on during the [game] and I will put in a request if I continue to be involved," Acevedo said.

The Army's Golden Knights Parachute Team will jump into FIU's Football Stadium Nov. 18 at 5:45 p.m.. The performance will be followed by the recognition of FIU veterans.

Headline: FIU aims to raise $70,000 to treat, prevent cancer
Author: Martha Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Hope for cancer survivors and remembrance for those who lost their lives to the disease are some of the reasons that bring together FIU and The American Cancer Society for the annual Relay for Life campaign.

This year's campaign, which  attempts to raise $70,000, kicked off Nov. 13 at Gracie's Grill in the Graham Center with a party to create awareness, get students involved, and motivate them to get others to participate as well.

Among those present at the opening party were some cancer survivors.

"The first time I came to this event, I was not a cancer survivor yet, and something I will always remember is the support and hope I felt through this event," said Mariana De Michele, a special guest.

The Relay for Life campaign consists of a series of events to raise funds to find a cure for the disease.

The main annual event is an 18 hour celebration that will take place Feb. 9 at the University Park football stadium. The event will begin with cancer survivors walking on what is called the Survivor's Victory Lap.

At sunset, a Luminaria, which is a ceremony in which candles will be lit in honor or in memory of those who have been touched by cancer, will be held. The Luminaria symbolizes the hope and determination of the community in fighting this disease.  

Also during the event, participating organizations, faculty, students, community members and families will decorate their tents according to this year's theme, which is Cirque Du Relay! A winner will be chosen.

"The main purpose of Relay is to represent the hope that those lost to cancer will never be forgotten and that those who face cancer will be supported, and that one day cancer will be eliminated, " said Vanessa Collado, marketing and publicity chair for the Relay For Life committee.

This year's $70,000 goal is set higher than last year's $60,000, and the funds will be used to treat and prevent the disease.

In previous years the event gathered 96,000 participants in Florida and 3 million worldwide.

This year, Relay will bring a new event: Miss Relay for Life 2007, which will be held Jan. 16. Tickets will be sold for $3 and the contest winner will be chosen by the audience's votes.

The first meeting for Miss Relay 2007 will be Jan. 8. 

"This will not be a beauty pageant; everyone can come and participate. The winner will win not by beauty but by heart" said Carmen Murphy, entertainment and activities chair.

The concept of Relay For Life began in 1985 when a doctor walked 83 miles on a local track for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer Society.

He raised $27,000. 

By the following year, he had 340 followers who walked with him during his overnight cancer walk. 

Statistics show that one in three Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.

The American Cancer Society's Relay for Life is a nationwide signature activity, the single largest non-profit event in the world, and a community developed and volunteer driven team event.

Headline: License plate offers more parking
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Students who buy the FIU Golden Panther specialty license plate can get more from their purchase than the chance to show a little school spirit. 

A new marketing initiative unveiled in the beginning of the Fall semester by Alumni Relations, the organization selling the license plates, offers those who buy the plate a choice of incentives that could make parking on campus just a little bit less painful.

The first incentive allows students, faculty, staff and FIU Alumni Association members who purchase the plate to have up to two outstanding campus parking tickets waived. The waiver applies only to parking tickets issued before Aug. 1, 2006, and excludes tickets for parking in handicapped spaces.

The second incentive offers students who join the association, as well as existing members, an upgrade to their parking decals from student to faculty/staff status for two consecutive semesters.

A third incentive allows association members to purchase an alumni parking decal at one-third of its normal cost. 

License plate buyers who are not interested in any of the incentives can get it for free the first year, waiving the processing fee associated with trading in their old plates in exchange for the specialty plates. 

The University sells the plates through the office of alumni relations to raise scholarship funds. Specialty plate buyers pay $25.10 in processing fees the first year. After that, the plates cost $27 annually. The annual renewal fees go to the University's License Plate Scholarship fund, a University-wide pool of general need-based scholarship funds. 

According to Terry Witherell, associate vice-president of external relations, FIU has been selling specialty license plates since 1987 and had brought in an average of $40,000 in annual scholarship money. That figure jumped to $50,000 with the release of the existing design in 2003, and it has gradually increased to $60,000.

"Everybody liked the new design, and with FIU's prominence on the rise, people are more willing to display affinity," Witherell said. 

According to Witherell, the new incentives were developed in conjunction with Parking and Transportation over the summer to boost license plate sales.

Parking and Transportation Director Bill Foster praised the program, saying that it benefits FIU, not just by raising scholarship money but also by providing advertising for the University.

However, the new incentives have created controversy. Already frustrated by insufficient parking spaces on campus, faculty members are not happy that students are being allowed to purchase faculty decals.

"As it is, faculty are unable to find proper parking," said Fatma Huffman of the public health department.

Huffman also believes that it may harm students just as much as faculty. 

She said that if student parking is converted into faculty parking to accommodate the students who buy the specialty plates, there will be less student spaces available for those who choose not to buy the plate.  

"Faculty can already park in student spaces and more faculty will be doing that if students are given the chance to park in faculty spaces. That will make it even harder for students to find parking," Huffman said. 

Sean Kramer, director of the Student Alumni Association, disagrees. 

"If faculty members are unhappy with this, it's only because they are misinformed and they perceive that this will hurt them. Our intent isn't to hurt the faculty," Kramer said.

According to Kramer, the service is only going to be offered to a limited number of students and if it begins to hurt the faculty and staff, it will be capped. 

"When we came up with this and talked it over with Parking and Traffic, we discussed all the consequences; we weren't cavalier about it," Witherell said. "They have a very good handle on the parking situation, and if enough students choose this option that it begins to take spots from the faculty, they could easily paint a row of blue spots."

While Foster is open to the idea of allocating more faculty spaces as demand for the specialty plates increases, he doesn't think capping the decal upgrade incentive is likely.

"We look out for what's in the best interest of FIU, and I can't imagine it happening," he said. "I'd like to see a member of the faculty come up to the administration and say, 'I want to stop selling these plates that raise funds for scholarship money because now it's harder for me to park.'"

Ultimately, selling the specialty plates is a matter of giving FIU a visible presence in the community, according to Foster.

"UM has 10,000 students, and you see Hurricanes stuff all over the place. FIU has, what, 38,000 students? I don't see why we can't have three times as many license plates on the road as they do," Foster said.

Headline: ANIMAL HOUSE: Students keep banned pets in housing
Author: Jose Pagliery / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When freshman Dawn Marquis realized she could not take her pet snake, a three-foot long ball python, into Panther Hall with her, she was forced to leave it behind at a pet store back home in Lakeland, Fl.

"I considered her my baby," Marquis said. "I wouldn't be letting her out, roaming the halls."

Her case is not rare and happens to many students with pets that move into the residence halls on campus. The rule, cited as Section I of the Resident Handbook, prohibits the possession of all pets except fish, although some students ignore the rules.

Murray Moss, a recent FIU graduate who lived at the Biscayne Bay Campus' Bay Vista residence hall, kept his three pet ferrets secret throughout the three years he lived in housing.

"The administration found out but couldn't prove that I had them because I kept the place spotless," he said. "They had a cage, where I'd put them during inspections and drills."

Following Moss' example, a number of current students may be doing the same, but Joseph Mattachione, director of the office of residential life, urges students not to, explaining that the main reasons for the strict regulation are the health and safety of the students. 

"Anything other than fish can crawl out of an aquarium," Mattachione said. "It can get into somebody else's room or get into some place where it can't get back out and it'll die. At that point it causes different issues with bugs and stuff in the rooms."

Because most dorms on campus are densely-populated, the rule also seeks to avoid other health concerns, such as dealing with an infestation of fleas, ticks or parasites. 

However, other health concerns not considered by the office also arise, such as emotional and mental health.

"There are lots of problems that come about when you lose a loved one, and it can be a dog, a cat, a mother, a wife or a child; it makes long-term changes which we're not familiar with," said  Jacob Gewirtz, director of the Behavioral Analysis Program.

It is possible that allowing students to keep pets may improve their well-being, and the University of Florida is one of the few state universities that keeps that in mind.

According to UF's handbook, residents may keep certain pets including fish, hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, frogs, geckos and lizards so long as they use a Pet Policy Agreement form, in which they acquire the approval of their fellow roommates and hallway staff. 

This rule is quite flexible in comparison to those at other universities across the state, but the effects may be disastrous. UF ranks number seven on Princeton Review's Dorms like Dungeons list. 

On the other hand, Florida State University and the University of Miami are not as lenient - neither university allows any pets whatsoever. Still, some will bend the rules, and this may explain why UM ranks in at number 15 on the list.

"People have other [pets] and just don't tell [their hallway managers]," said John Dietz, a sophomore at UM. 

He is not the only student at either UM or FIU to admit knowing someone who owns a cat or dog, secretly keeping the animal in their room at all times.

Mattachione also addresses the possible lack of responsibility.

 "I've been at campuses where they had a huge cat issue because somebody had cats that bred with the local cats and now they have cats everywhere," Mattachione said.

Although FIU's pet regulation may already seem stringent, it also imposes a restriction on the size of the fish tank itself, limiting it to 10 gallons or less.

"A 30-gallon tank takes up as much space as a TV," Marquis said, questioning the logic behind the limit and pointing out that students living in housing often have televisions much larger than the largest fish tank allowed. 

However, Mattachione explains that the issue is not the size, but the water.

"If a 30 gallon tank falls over, it could soak down, maybe go into the wall, drop into the room below, and impact more people at the end of the hallway," he said.

Mattachione believes that the ultimate goal of the policy is to try to make the environment safe and secure for as many people as possible.

"Any policies we have about fire safety, noise and others are not meant to be a hindrance. It's meant to respect the rights and responsibilities of everybody in the building," Mattachione said.

Headline: International students find opportunities in workshop
Author: BegoÑe Cazalis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A job strategies workshop dedicated to international students will take place Nov. 16 at the Biscayne Bay Campus in the Wolfe University Center from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. as part of the International Education Week.

The event, which is sponsored and organized by the International Students & Scholars Services, the International Students Club and the Student Government Association, will deal with job opportunities nationally and abroad available for the great number of international students at FIU.

"Students who had not considered studying or working abroad will now have the opportunity to see things in a global perspective," said sophomore Michelle Jakes, who works as a graduate assistant for ISSS.

The conference will be given by ISSS Associate Director Nancy Hernandez. She advises international students on immigration issues and oversees the programs created for the international FIU community.

Hernandez will cover options for working and studying abroad, as well as strategies for locating international internships. 

Hernandez will also answer particular questions relating specifically to visas, their guidelines and the students' opportunities as employees. 

"I think international students will know they are an appreciated and valued part of the FIU community," Jakes said.

The International Education Week is a program created by the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of State.

FIU has a total international student population of 2,769 and over 100 scholars representing 125 countries.

The goal is to promote global understanding through international education and cultural exchange. 

The events will take place in colleges, universities and communities all over the nation from Nov. 13 to Nov. 17.

During the week, BBC and University Park will be holding cultural events including study abroad fairs, cultural fairs, lunches and lectures on immigration and other issues.

Junior Dennis Gebken is German and the vice-president of the International Student Club; an organization dedicated to fostering diversity at FIU, which is also helping organize the event.

"We want students to share their traditions and get involved with the club," Gebken said. 

"The goal is for them to connect with other peers and institutions that can help them and have fun."

Headline: Some Homecoming events made just for BBC students
Author: Ever Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For Shaunia Stokes, Homecoming means something more than just a week of festivities.  A senior Homecoming court candidate for Biscayne Bay Campus, Stokes felt the week-long event gave her the opportunity to leave her mark before she graduated.

"Come with an open mind and leave with your walls and horizons expanded," Stokes said.  

Senior Omer "Bill" Buchanan was thrilled about Homecoming Week this year as well. 

As president of the Student Programming Council at University Park and one of UP's candidates, he couldn't wait for the festivities to begin.

"Hell yeah, I'm excited," said Buchanan. 

"This is the best time of the year for us college students. We get to intermingle as a student body."

Homecoming at BBC started Nov. 9 and ran for an entire week through Nov. 16.  

Junior Jonathan Valdelamar, a member of SPC, explained that homecoming events are held at BBC as a compromise for students on both campuses.

 "It's not fair for everyone living on this campus or near it to go to [UP]," Valdelamar said.

The festivities began with MTVU's Gamers Ball in the Wolfe University Center Ballroom.

The Ball was a video game tournament where students played video games not yet on the market. Students had a chance to win video games and an XBOX 360.

Gamers Ball was not all the day had in store.

The Fourth Annual Homecoming Step Show took place late into the night.

The show brought out fraternities and sororities to compete and see who had the best dance routine.

Senior Danis Sosa said the event was a good distraction for the students.

Apollo Night gave students the opportunity to show off their talent or as Tiffany Simmons, homecoming chairperson, described it, "Apollo Night is an event where the talented and the talentless can participate."

BET presented the talent show at the Mary Ann Wolfe Theater while P. Diddy and Malek Sannon from the Bad Boys of Comedy hosted.

The AIDS Awareness Auction took place in the WUC Ballrooms Nov. 8 at 8 p.m. to inform and educate the FIU community about the HIV virus and AIDS.  

The event auctioned off single men and women and the highest bidders won a date to the Homecoming dance.  According to Simmons, all proceeds from the auction supported the Children's Home Society.

The FIU versus Louisiana-Lafayette pep rally and the block party brought out students to the Academic II parking lot Nov. 15.  

D.J. Khaled of 99 Jamz was busy on the turntables providing the music.

Homecoming voting will occur at WUC's Panther Square Nov. 16.

The annual dance has students, Stokes and Simmons included, awaiting the crowning of the court.

Sophomore Petra Havenfelt that every student should have come out and experienced homecoming.  

"Come out and support the shows, show love for FIU," Haven said.

Headline: History, solace found in local monastery
Author: Agustina Prigoshin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Banyan trees with column-forming branches, hip-height bushes snaking through the garden and religious statues decorate the inside of the 10th century monastery just two miles north of the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Natalie Kasabasic, 29, and Jason Church, 32, traveled from Anarbor, Michigan, to get married in the monastery's chapel and have their reception within the cloisters of the Church of St. Bernard de Clairvaux. Kasabasic said they chose the old Spanish monastery  due to its echoes of times passed.

"My family is Italian and this monastery reminds us very much of the Old Country so we want to get married here," Kasabasic said.

Carolina Del Vecchio, wedding coordinator for the monastery, said that there is always something going on.

"We are very busy as far as weddings go," Del Vecchio said. "We have a different event every weekend."

For the past 50 years, the monastery has not only been a place of worship but a museum and a wedding spot as well.

Equipped with a map of the monastery's layout, the self-guided tourist can roam peacefully through the picturesque garden which provides a welcomed departure from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Ambling through the halls that Cistercian monks walked though centuries ago sparks a sense of historic curiosity.

The ancient Spanish monastery was built in the year 1133 in Sacramenia, Spain, north of Madrid, and named Monastery of Our Lady, Queen of the Angels.

The Cistercian monks lived in the monastery for about 700 years until the social revolution of the 1830s when the monastery's cloisters were seized, sold and turned into a granary and stable.

In 1925, publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst bought the cloisters and the monastery's outbuildings, dismantled them stone by stone and had everything shipped to Brooklyn, New York, for about $3,005.

By the time the shipment arrived during the Great Depression, Hearst's financial problems left him no choice but to sell the stones at auction. 

The stones were kept inside a warehouse in Brooklyn until a year after Hearst's death in 1952 when two Florida developers purchased them to use as a tourist attraction.

It took almost 19 months and $1.5 million dollars to put the monastery back together.

About 23 men spent 90 days opening all the boxes and sorting through more than 35,000 stones, some weighing more than one and a half tons, in what came to be known at that time as the greatest jigsaw puzzle in history.

The monastery was called The Mission of St. John the Divine for about one year from 1963 to 1964 and was changed to its current name in honor of the saint who had been an influence among the Cistercian.

Visitors can see the process of putting the monastery back together through photographs hanging on the walls of the gift shop.

In the patio, paved paths swirl around Banyan trees, through the Savior's Garden, along the Loggia and into the cloisters. The open-aired hallways house a prayer well in the center carved out of a second-century Roman temple column.

"It's very peaceful and serene here," said Estela Saez, 54, who found out about the monastery several years ago from a pamphlet.

"I enjoy coming to meditate among all this history," Saez said.

The museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.. 

Holy Eucharist services are on Wednesdays at 10 a.m. and Sundays (in English) at 8 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.. Spanish services are on Sundays at 12:15 p.m.. Students with ID pay a $2.50 admission charge.

Headline: Editorial: Wertheim's gift more than just business
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
After FIU President Modesto A. Maidique handled a dispute with Dr. Herbert Wertheim poorly, he not only lost $20 million in funds, he also severed FIU's relationship with one of the its oldest and closest friends.

Defending his actions, Maidique said that his handling of the matter was "strictly business." 

"Strictly business" is a good adjective for the direction the University has taken over the past three or four years.

FIU has taken to recruiting administrators from executive positions in major corporations, including Vice President of Administration Marcos Perez, who was formerly a vice president at the Bacardi Beverage Company, and Chief Financial Officer Vivian Sanchez, who previously worked at Visa International Service Association.  

The recent termination of contracts with long-time University business partners over the past year, including Smoothie Time in early 2006 and the FIU Copy Center in the late summer, point in the same direction.

When Wertheim decided to disburse his $20 million donation in payments over time rather than in one lump sum, Maidique handled it as another business decision: it came down to numbers and contract stipulations.

As Maidique sees it, Wertheim signed a contract and then failed to adhere to it. For him, the matter came down to a simple breach of contract.

Maidique has argued that the naming rights for a school of medicine are usually given in exchange for donations much larger than $20 million. He claimed that a donor could easily be found willing to donate $100 million or more.

Moreover, if the University received the $20 million payment in full, it could begin accumulating interest immediately.

Wertheim's relationship with the University goes much deeper than a simple business relationship. He has served FIU in different capacities - including chairman, vice chairman and member of the Board of Trustees - and already donated millions of dollars to the University. 

Wertheim has been with FIU as it has grown from a small-time commuter school to a major state university. FIU's relationship with Wertheim isn't just business - it's family.

Given the character of Wertheim's relationship with FIU, Maidique should have received the former trustee's concerns with respect and addressed them accordingly. 

Rather than alienating Wertheim, it would have been more appropriate - and dignified - for him to seek a reasonable compromise with a long-time friend of the University.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Facts don't line up in food editorial
Author: Jonathan Garcia / Consultant for the Office of Business Services  
&nbsp;
I make it a habit of reading The Beacon on a regular basis to keep in touch with the pulse of our FIU community. However, I recently encountered an article in the Nov. 9 issue, which inaccurately reported the facts.

 The article in question was an indictment of the food service on campus titled "Vendor contract gives students no options." In this article, the reporter describes Aramark, our food service provider, as a monopoly setting "food prices at its leisure." These statements are untrue and very damaging, given the context in which this information was presented. In an attempt to correct this error, here are the correct facts:

1. Aramark was chosen as our food service provider through an open bid process.

2. The decision to choose Aramark over other providers was made entirely by a committee comprised of SGA representatives, faculty, staff and administration.

3. The retail food options available today were based on recommendations from the committee.

4. The price increase at the Fresh Food Company was the result of the door price not having been changed for over three years.

5. The pricing at all of the branded retail locations is the same pricing as any location outside of FIU.

6. All price increases require the approval of FIU.

7. FIU has made a commitment to Aramark to guarantee 1,200 housing meal plans per semester, not 3,065.

8. Other vendors are welcome to provide food service on campus, but must be contracted through Aramark. A perfect example is the Bustelo Cuban coffee shop opening in the spring semester. 

These are the facts and there are a great deal more facts available. The most prominent fact not mentioned is that Aramark is one of the largest contributing business partners of unrestricted grants to FIU. In the end, our business partners should, at the very least, be evaluated in a manner consistent with the ideals and freedoms The Beacon seeks to protect.

Headline: Like a Virgo: Students question astrological accuracy
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Scorpion, the Scales, the Water Bearer, the Goat - no, these are not tantric positions, but they are the familiar symbols in the zodiac.

In all, 12 celestial symbols make up the creatures of the zodiac, a word whose Greek origin aptly means "little animals." Well, little animals and that pesky scale - a ridiculous inclusion if you ask me. But then again, isn't the whole notion of astrology ridiculous as it is? Maybe it's a pseudo-science, or like another bad episode of "Charmed."

 Our experiences with the zodiac vary - for me it was Walter Mercado, a man who shattered conventional gender norms for me at such a tender age - but where's the truth? Do all Gemini's have split personalities? Are all Cancers just commonly crabby crustaceans? And more importantly, are all Scorpios really good lays? 

"I don't believe it… I see the zodiac as a money-making scheme based on ancient pagan symbols," said junior Ryan Capiro. "I think it's all a crock of s---t," he said.

Capiro is a Taurus, by the way.  

The Babylonians developed the first known system of celestial coordinates and dubbed the moon and the naked-eye planets (Mercury, Mars, Venus, Saturn and Jupiter) the "wandering stars." To the Babylonians, these roving lights represented the gods they worshipped from down here on Earth. Since then, the practice of correlating relationships between celestial bodies and us mortals has been passed through the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, and through the minds of modern thinkers like Carl Jung, who once said "astrology is assured of recognition from psychology, without further restrictions, because astrology represents the summation of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity."

A controversial use of the zodiac, invented by Michel Guaquelin, is the "Mars Effect." 

The Mars Effect argues that the location of the planet Mars has a causal relationship with the birth of sports champions and super-athletes. Multi-Wimbledon champion Venus Williams is said to be affected by the Effect, but not little sister Serena.    

Today, the zodiac, a poster child of astrology, has occupied the pages of many fashion magazines - even longer than airbrushing. The advent of the Internet age means you can now get your horoscope, or an astrological prediction of the future, to your e-mail. Many times, however, people feel these horoscopes can be as vague as a drunken uncle.

"It's all so vague … people want to read themselves into it because it makes them feel like there's something bigger guiding everything," said senior Richard Garcia, who is double majoring in women's studies and psychology.  "Besides, studying psychology made me way too empirical to believe in stuff like that," Garcia said.

Can the zodiac be a good way to analyze your date? Or whether he or she will be good in the sack? Is it worth asking the age-old question, "Hey baby, what's your sign?"

"I think it might be on to something sometimes, but that's just coincidental. It's not something I really ask about or cared to know," said sophomore Ivana Vento.

As college students, we're trained to put a lot of trust into tests, texts and theories by men who probably aren't alive anymore. As a critical thinker, you become less likely to believe things that have no concrete foundation as truth.

However, regardless of whether you believe in astrology or not, there is an important point to keep in mind.

"What experiment could ever be done to prove, or disprove, that it's possible to tell the future? Historically, for example, Freud argued that parapsychological or paranormal phenomena such as astrology has no validity, while Jung argued it is premature to rule out its validity because it is possible that we just haven't discovered a way to test it," said William Kurtines, professor of psychology.  

"The idea that the continents moved was not too long ago considered to be Looney Tunes geology, but now we have geologists who not only study the movement of continents, but do so using very complex and sophisticated empirical and mathematical models," Kurtines said. "We don't have enough evidence to say it's not true, or enough evidence to say that it is."

So it just may be that, like all good things in life, there is no absolute certainty. It's entirely possible that astrology could be just as bogus as Kevin Federline's rap debut, or a very advanced theory of tectonics that operates on a celestial and psycho-social level; we may never be able to say with complete certainty. And the world may never know if Scorpios do really make excellent lovers - although that's far less difficult to test.

Headline: Campaign trail hectic, worthwhile
Author: Chris Cabral / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Working on a political campaign is fun, if you like that sort of thing. Of course, you probably already know if you'd enjoy a job with a political cause or campaign. Do you find yourself already wondering who'll be elected president in 2008? Are you one of the 37 people who actually watch C-SPAN? Do you know the names of more Congressmen than American Idol contestants? If you answer yes to any of these questions, then congratulations, you're a political junkie - the worst kind.

As a political junkie and progressive Democrat, I've spent the last two election cycles working for political causes. 

In 2004, I spent my days hitting people up for money in the street to raise funds for the Democratic National Committee. I greeted everyone with the phrase, "Hi, would you like to help defeat George W. Bush?" Those who shared our goals most often responded with "Yes!" although others replied, "Hell yes," and I did get the occasional, "Who? George Bush? I hate that guy! F--- him!" Unfortunately, others were not so sympathetic but were equally vulgar. "F--- YOU!" was a common response, but I received the whole range of insults often levied at Democrats. I was called a terrorist, ugly and an idiot.

A seemingly kind old lady once approached me and asked in broken English how old I was. I told her I was 17. She yelled at me and told me I was not old enough to vote and therefore I was "anti-constitutional."

On another occasion, a pack of roving Bush loyalists began cursing at me from their skateboards. They regaled me with all sorts of various insights, including the assertion that John Kerry was a "stupid gay idiot." They were about 10 years old.

This year I worked for Dave Patlak, who sought to defeat incumbent congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a 16-year incumbent with more than $1.5 million in her war chest. I was motivated by her support for the Iraq war and her loyalty to Bush. I wanted to work for whomever decided to run against her. To my pleasant surprise, I was offered an internship by her opponent, and he turned out to be a very good guy. He spent much of his time calling potential donors to raise money. That's how most grassroots candidates raise money. 

Of course, if you're an incumbent, people call you to give you money. That's part of the reason why incumbents have a 95% re-election rate. Yet, we strove to defeat her against all odds.

It sounds dramatic, but you see, in campaigns the actual process is a lot more mundane.

We fought the power - by sending letters. We struck a blow to the Republican empire - by licking stamps all day. Our struggle to move America forward was often fought in the streets, but mostly from the confines of a cramped office.

If you ever work for a campaign, you're going to have to do some things that you may consider boring. Just remind yourself: You're not just inputting data in a computer, you're helping America. You're not just handing out flyers, you're spreading the truth. Once you've learned to maintain that perspective, the job becomes enjoyable. After all, some one has to do this stuff. 

In the end, I learned much from the experience, and I met some pretty cool people. Dave Patlak was a great candidate, but his opponent had more than 10 times as much money, and she spent it. If this were a T.V. movie, our underdog candidate would have beaten the odds and triumphed in the face of adversity. It would have been a real David vs. Goliath story. But this was not Lifetime or the feel good movie of the year. This was politics. And in politics, usually Goliath wins. By 22 percentage points.

Headline: The Hook Up: College students trade traditional relationships for one-night stands
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Junior Alex Rodriguez recalled a party he recently attended where he met up with a female high school friend who he hadn't seen in years. They talked about high school memories and caught up on each other's current lives. By the time the party was finished, the two friends had caught up in more ways than one. 

"I hadn't seen my friend in years, and she looked completely different and better than the last time that I had seen her," Rodriguez said. "We talked a little, and one thing led to another before we ended up hooking up. I had no idea that it would have happened."

For students like Rodriguez, "hooking up" is a spontaneous occurrence ­- something that impulsively happens at a party or another sort of social gathering. For other students like junior Daniel Cruz, however, hooking up is an alternative to a traditional relationship.

"I've given committed relationships a chance, and they really take a lot out of you, especially if and when the relationship ends," said Cruz. "With hooking up or a one-night stand, I don't feel much of an emotional connection, so it's less of a hassle."

According to Sex, Etc., a sexuality education website hosted by the Rutgers University Center for Applied Psychology, the definition of hooking up is different depending on whom you ask. However, the website does offer a simple definition: sexual activity such as kissing, touching or sexual intercourse between two people or more.

Rodriguez's and Cruz's hookup encounters aren't sporadic incidents. Such encounters have been the focus of magazines such as Seventeen, whose website www. Seventeen.com recently held a hookup survey that received more than 10,000 responses. According to the website's survey, 30% of the people who responded hooked up with someone on the same day they had met for the first time. Also, 64% of the respondents hooked up with someone they consider a friend.

Some students such as sophomore Jackie Gadea are surprised at the revealing responses.

"The statistics are definitely shocking to me," she said. "I am aware that most girls are more sexually active than before, but it's kind of appalling to get these statistics from a magazine whose target audience is teenage girls."

Other media not directly marketed to teenagers also focus on non-committal sexual activity. Both Askmen.com and Ivillage.com, two general interest websites aimed at males and females respectively, have entire sections dedicated to one-night stands. A one-night stand article on Askmen.com includes a step-by-step guide to having one with steps such as  "Spot your Prey" and "Close the Deal."  

According to Psychology Professor Martha Montgomery, it's not unusual for college students to have casual sex, but such an activity could have negative psychological consequences.

"It is not abnormal for young adults, both men and women, to engage in one-night stands or casual sex (i.e. sex within 48 hours of meeting) at some point," Montgomery said in an e-mail interview with The Beacon. "That said, any person who continually engages in casual sex without establishing contact beyond the one-night stand is depriving themselves of intimacy or commitment involved in close, personal relationships."

Montgomery advises that students know what they are getting into before having a one-night stand.

"Know that the goal of a one-night stand is to have sex without establishing a strong emotional connection with the sexual partner," Montgomery said. "When you engage in a one-night stand, it does not matter what the person's background is, what their interests are, or whether or not their parents will like you. You can only hope that the person is 'good in bed.'"

Despite the lack of an emotional connection when hooking up, a casual sexual encounter could result into something significant, but it more than likely won't.

"It is definitely possible for a one-night stand to develop into a long-term meaningful relationship, but this is not the norm," she said.

Montgomery cited a survey conducted in the early '90s concerning sexual behavior in America by John Gagnon, Edward Laumann and colleagues. While the data is fairly old, she still uses the material in lectures because of the large sample and detailed measures. According to the survey's results, only 1.4% of married couples had sex within 2 days of meeting.

"Whatever benefits exist with one-night stands, the best sex of your life will most likely be within the context of a meaningful, long-term relationship," Montgomery said. "A sexual partner whom you trust and know intimately is one with whom you can experiment safely and comfortably, and one who truly knows how to please you sexually."
