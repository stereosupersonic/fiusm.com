Headline: Don't be ashamed of your pop proclivity
Author: Robert Gramatages, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I noticed something funny on my way home from the Grove the  other night. I found myself jamming to a Justin Timberlake song and it made me stop and think. 

Would I be listening to this song and even singing along to it if I weren't alone in the car? My question was answered when I rolled down my window to pay a toll. I turned the music down as to not be ridiculed for blasting the musical endeavors of an ex-Mickey Mouse Club Member.

This little incident made think back to conversations I have had concerning music as a form of art versus music as a product. Most people who say they are music savvy consider a pop song a product spoon-fed to pre-teens through radio stations as well as music television. By no means is it considered "real music."

If indeed the music itself can be considered a product, then business forces come into play. These products wouldn't be successful if people didn't want them. With no demand, a product will pretty much go nowhere. So the idea of the public being pushed to like certain songs, and therefore buy certain albums, can only be true to an extent.

What is true about the radio and music television is that they choose the songs that people hear on a daily basis, some by popular request, but the rest based on other factors. 

Exposure is key for the success of many songs, so those songs that do not get rotation on the radio or TV are left to fend for themselves. However, a good song can still become popular without such initial exposure. 

Take Norah Jones' "Don't Know Why" as an example. Music that is well marketed and widely accepted is automatically discarded, I feel, without proper justification. 

Pop music is different from artsy music. Different genres satisfy different cravings. Sometimes people don't want to listen to poetic rhymes and intricate instrumentation. They just want to zone out for three and a half minutes. 

Also, I think that popular music is an accessory to some people. It's nothing on its own, but it's a nice touch, like a baseball cap or a watch. It's just like a supplemental soundtrack to the drama of everyday life. 

Now, why is it so taboo for a music lover to listen Justin and friends? I mean, let's face it: Pop music is catchy. While some would compare its catchiness to the flu, I think the best analogy would be to compare pop to sugar. 

Pop music is to "real music" as sugar is to coffee. Music in general is a cup of Joe and pop music is a packet of Equal. 

I have seen some kids (and a few adults) eat the sugar right out of the packet. There are people with a sweet tooth. No harm, no foul. 

Music aficionados, like coffee buffs, prefer their coffee black. They are insulted with the suggestion of tainting their musical collection with a Sum 41 album.  

I take my coffee sweet. I balance my affinity for music with the charm of pop music. Some like bitter coffee, some add sugar for extra punch. 

I rarely hear people get persecuted for taking sugar in their coffee, so why should I be scolded for liking Christina Aguilera's new album?

The way I see it, if I refuse to give pop songs a listen, I am being a hypocrite. I like music of all types, whether fashionable or detestable. I choose different songs for different moods and refuse to feel impotent in musical discussions for having Stripped in heavy rotation at home. 

 In the end, who really cares if Christina is a "Fighter" and Justin wants to "Rock Your Body?" I do. Will I be sent to music hell for even remembering the names of these songs? I think not. 

If you want meaningful music/lyrics you may have to embark on the arduous journey of finding a Bjork fan on campus (they do exist) or maybe check out a Metallica album. 

However, if you just want to turn the radio up on the way home from school or work and jam to a pop record, by all means, do so without feeling persecuted.

Headline: Little Shop of Horrors bursts with energy
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Tired of hyped-up but ultimately disappointing summer flicks?  Bored to tears with special effects that are increasing exponentially across Hollywood but fail to deliver true excitement or awe?   

The supremely satisfying "Little Shop of Horrors" is bursting with special effects itself, but the musical takes it back to basics to show us that something as seemingly simple as a puppet can still awe and enthrall.

Based on Roger Corman's 1960 cult classic, "Little Shop of Horrors" has already seen two adaptations: an off-Broadway musical and the 1986 musical film. Now, the singing plant has finally found its way into Broadway, but not before previewing for us lucky denizens of South Florida.

Opening last week in the cozy confines of the Miracle Theater, "Little Shop" threatened to burst the roof off the building; the energy of the cast was unstoppable as they cavorted from one song to the next, never stopping for air.

Skid row's version of the Supremes - Chiffon, Crystal and Ronnette - function as a version of the classic chorus, chiming in sweetly at all the right places.  They are a constant presence on stage, and their terrific voices, animated faces and comical gestures are an inextricable part of the show.

Seymour's clumsy, good-natured and shy personality was portrayed perfectly; while Audrey, bright and ditzy, had just the right amount of absurdity without sacrificing the pathetic core to her character. 

The original Seymour in the off-Broadway production does just as well in makeup as the conniving but essentially morally upright Mushnik. And this production's incarnation of the sadistic, nitrous oxide-inhaling dentist, Orin, lived up to its predecessors. 

Last but not least, the most important character (arguably) in the cast, Audrey II, is as wonderful as anything in the "Lion King."  With the efforts of four people, Audrey II really comes alive.  At first an unassuming little plant, the puppet grows as the production moves along, becoming, in the end, a stage-hogging monstrosity with an amazing, soulful voice to match.

"Little Shop of Horrors" is more fascinating and funnier than anything in the movie theaters; the experience of seeing and hearing these actors live is more invigorating than watching anything through a screen. Take advantage of the Broadway show while it's here:  "See it before it eats Broadway alive!"

Headline: Plug into The Matrix
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Get your leather trench coat and black Ray-Ban sunglasses ready. It's time to enter the matrix ... again. So, we can't really enter the matrix, but we sure entered movie theatres May 15. Thousands of moviegoers and avid fans waited in line for their chance to watch the second edition to the Wachowski brothers' Sci-fi action flick.  The movie entitled "The Matrix: Reloaded" brought in an approximate $134 million opening weekend, proving that philosophy and violence do mix. 

The movie, which stars some old faces including Keanu Reeves (Neo), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), takes place a little while after the last movie ended. There are some new editions to film, including Jada Pinkett Smith who plays Niobi, Morpheus' rebellious ex-girlfriend, and Harold Perrineau who plays Link, the comic relief on the Nebuchadnezzar. 

"The Matrix: Reloaded" also includes the return of the infamous villain, Agent Smith, and his newfound pastime - making more Agent Smiths. Now not only is there one bad guy, but there are dozens, which makes for some very interesting action sequences. Fighting a rebellious agent is the least of  the human race's problems. There are millions of robots threatening to destroy Zion, the last human city, and Neo seems to be its last hope. However, Neo is still struggling to discover why he is the "One" and what he must do to save Zion. Neo's journey into the matrix is fueled with questions about his fate. This all leads to a labyrinth of plot twists and turns that will leave the audience marveled. 

This sequel is engrossing for those who have grown to like the characters. One wants to know about Neo and Trinity's romance, if Neo is truly the "One" and if humans prevail over machines. "The Matrix: Reloaded" does a great job of sucking you into their world.  A good example would be the fifteen minute car chase that seems to last forever. While Trinity is jumping from car to car, Neo is flying through the air like Superman, making it very hard for audiences to ignore the computer graphics. This, however, makes everyone wonder "How'd they do that?" instead of sparking an interest in what's actually occurring. Although most people (including me) would complain that this scene (and others alike) are too long and have an excess of computer graphics, everyone kept watching to know what came next. So, who cares if the action scenes were too long? They were awesome anyway.

"The Matrix: Reloaded" is one of those blockbuster films that die-hard fans dream about seeing. It has spawned a new era, perhaps doing for this generation what "Star Wars" did for the baby boomer generation. A battle between the Nebuchadnezzar and the Death Star would end in serious fatalities for the dark side. That's the reason why "The Matrix: Reloaded" has sparked the interest of a new generation of movie lovers. There is no denying that "Star Wars" is a great epic film, but it can never be as dark and dreary as "The Matrix" trilogy. "Star Wars" looks like a bedtime story compared to "The Matrix's" story of terror and violence. Both movies challenged the imagination of their generation, but "The Matrix" encompasses the more-is-better mentality generation X and Y seem to have adopted. The more violence, the more action, the more nudity, the more sexual content, the better the movie is and the more money it makes. Its philosophical jargon is catchy and its action scenes are outrageous. There is no denying that this movie is more like a video game with a confusing plot, than an epic film; but that doesn't mean the movie isn't one of the most innovative and entertaining films of this generation. 

How a movie makes you feel is the most important aspect of a film, and "The Matrix: Reloaded" makes me feel like moving to Zion. The overall atmosphere just makes me want to be one of the "cool" characters with the perfect bodies and graceful moves. How exciting would it be to be so powerful and know true reality? It would be so perfect to step out of everyday life and be able to go against gravity, dodge bullets and have a cool hacker name like Link or Storm ... oh ... wait, that's "X-men." 

With all the hype and "Animatrix" movies, it is a wonder "The Matrix: Reloaded" lived up to the expectations. It manages to engross viewers and give them more of what they want. There is more confusing philosophy, more violence and even an outrageous sex scene for those who thought the first movie needed a little sexual kick.

"The Matrix: Revolutions" trailer at the end of the credits is sure to keep fans hungry for the last installment of the trilogy. So make sure you get your pre-paid tickets ready because "The Matrix: Reloaded" is sure to be causing long lines at ticket booths for a while.

Headline: Double Play
Subheadline: Rivera, Nanita make impact in first year at FIU
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Usually when a ball player joins a brand new team, it takes a while to adjust, especially when coming from another country and having to learn a whole new language in the process. 

But somebody must have forgotten to tell that to Luis Rivera and Ricardo Nanita.

For Rivera, FIU's freshman shortstop, and Nanita, a junior-transfer center fielder, the transition to playing baseball in the United States has been relatively smooth.

"I practiced a lot before I even got here, preparing myself to play ball in Division I, which helped make it a lot easier," said Rivera, who played baseball in his native Puerto Rico, before joining the Golden Panthers.

Nanita, who hails from the Dominican Republic, played two years of baseball at Chipola Junior College in Marianna, Fla. before joining FIU this season.

"It's been a lot different here. In junior college, it was more intense. Here at FIU, the coaches just let you play your game," said Nanita, who led the team in eight offensive statistical categories this year, including homeruns (12), RBI (47), batting average (.372), runs scored (48), and on-base percentage (.482).

But according to the six-foot, 202 pound southpaw Nanita, his success shouldn't come as any surprise.

"The reason I came here is to do exactly what I am doing and more. I had some pressure in the beginning, but I dealt with it," Nanita said.

But Nanita knows that the key to his success as FIU's top power hitter is only as good as the guys batting in front of him.

"It's the other guys like Rivera, Diaz, and Pullin, the line drive hitters who can run and get on base that make me better. I hit better with runners in scoring position. That's my job. That's what I do," added Nanita.

And being FIU's top run producer is exactly what Coach Danny Price had in mind when he brought him here.

"That's exactly why we brought him in here, and he has gotten progressively better every day since he's been here. He's just been outstanding," said Price. 

As for the 6'2", 170 pound, right-handed Rivera, besides playing solid defense, his main objective is putting the ball in play.

"I just try to be on base, because if I'm on base, I'm going to score runs. The guys behind me, like Ricardo, are great hitters. I just try to always be on base, and leave the rest up to our RBI guys," said Rivera. 

And the durable Rivera hasn't disappointed, leading FIU in hits (76), doubles (14), games played (54), and games started (54), in addition to batting .338 with 41 RBI, trailing only Nanita in those two categories. 

In addition to the unexpected offense, Rivera might be FIU's best defensive player on the field, committing only eight errors in 227 chances.

"I don't know that he's not the best shortstop to ever play here at FIU," said Price. "I love ground balls going to Luis." 

And while Rivera knew he would make an immediate defensive impact, he admits he never expected to do so well offensively. 

"I always had good defense, but offensively, I just try to make a lot of contact and good things have happened for me," said Rivera, who also produced a season high 23-game hitting streak in addition to winning several games with late inning heroics at the plate.

"I just like the game to be in my hands because I play better under pressure, and I know I'll be successful in that moment," added Rivera.

"Luis just scraps at the plate. The more pressure he's under, the better he is. He rises under pressure and steps up to the next level," said Price. "He's always capable of getting the big hit."

But Rivera and Nanita, who are also roommates, know their success directly feeds off one another.

"Ricardo is so important to this team. He's the key guy offensively. He has all the tools to be a professional baseball player," said Rivera.

And that's what Nanita hopes to do.

"I hope I can go somewhere and play baseball professionally after FIU," Nanita said.

And according to Nanita, Rivera has done nothing but impress him since his arrival. 

"He impressed me from the beginning. I knew he could play defense, but he really impressed me with his hitting. He's going to be an awesome player for FIU," said Nanita.

When not on the field, Nanita, a 21-year-old liberal studies major with a 2.5 GPA, and Rivera, a 19-year-old athletic training major with a 3.2 GPA, spend most of their time resting, studying, and hanging out with some of their other teammates.

"Ricardo is my best friend here, but we don't go out much. Usually we'll just hang out with Dennis [Diaz], Solomon [Frieder], Ferny [Alvarez], and the Monreal brothers if we aren't practicing," added Rivera. 

"We spend most of our time trying to get better and improve as baseball players," Rivera said.

With the way they have performed in their rookie season at FIU, more practice and experience should do nothing but make this duo even that much more dangerous as leaders next season.

Headline: Season over as baseball falls short in SBC championship quest, misses Regionals for first time in seven years
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers took part in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament this past week in Lafayette, Louisiana, winning two of three games before being eliminated Friday night by Western Kentucky. 

Despite a 36-23 record and a RPI in the low 40's, FIU was denied an invitation to the postseason on Monday after six straight Regional appearances.

"Our strength of schedule was second in the conference, so I [was] hoping that [would] help get us in," Price said.

Game One - WKU 13, FIU 9

Josh Banks, Ammer Cabrera, and Derek Taylor combined to give up 18 hits and four homeruns, and the FIU offense came up short in its comeback attempt, as the Golden Panthers fell 13-9 to the Hilltoppers in the first game of the Sun Belt Conference Tournament Wednesday at "Tigue" Moore Field.

Junior Josh Banks, FIU's most dependable pitcher all season, had an off day, allowing nine hits and six runs in 4.2 innings of work.

"Josh just got hit a little bit, but Western Kentucky has really hit the ball better than anyone else in the conference all year long, and they got a little pitching to go along with it," said head coach Danny Price.

Said Banks: "I talked to one of the Western Kentucky players after the game, and he told me their coach wouldn't let them swing at anything except fastballs, but I didn't know until after the game," 

 "Everything was going pretty good for me, all my other pitches, they  just wouldn't swing at them. I left a couple fastballs up in the zone, and I got hit," he said.

With the score tied at three in the fourth inning, Western Kentucky took the lead when Matt Gunning singled off Banks to score Brent Miller, giving the Hilltoppers a 4-3 lead.

Banks ran into more trouble in the fifth, allowing a RBI single to Antone Towns, and a RBI double to Miller to make the score 6-3.

WKU added to the lead in the sixth with a five-run explosion off Taylor, capped by a solo homerun by Rafael Vallejo, putting the Hilltoppers up 11-3 entering the seventh.

But FIU fought back, getting two runs in the seventh on RBI singles by Fernando Alvarez and James Bacon to cut the lead to 11-5.

After giving up two more runs to WKU in the bottom of the inning, the Golden Panther offense made a last gasp at a comeback in the eighth.

With two outs recorded, Mike Lopez walked, Ricardo Nanita was hit by a pitch, and Solomon Frieder (3-for-3, three runs, two RBI) singled to right, making the score 13-6.

"Solomon had a great weekend for us. He really hit the ball well," Price said.

Adam Summerell followed with a three-run shot to left-center, cutting the lead to four at 13-9.

"That was a big hit. We were just trying to catch up, but when he hit that homerun, it kept the game alive," Price said.

But Skip Adams flied out to third, ending the threat, and FIU couldn't score again in the ninth, dropping the crucial opening game.

"This was a really tough game, but you really have to stay in the winner's bracket, but things just didn't work out," added Price.

Game Two - FIU 5, ASU 4

Facing a must-win situation, sophomore Dennis Diaz kept FIU's FIU's season alive, hitting a two-run, game-winning homerun in the top of the sixth inning, to propel FIU to a 5-4 victory over Arkansas State on Thursday afternoon at "Tigue" Moore Field.

For Diaz, the hit marked his first homerun of the season, and shocked his head coach in the process, leaving no doubts in his mind.

"Wow. It was a huge hit, but I knew it was out as soon as he hit it," head coach Danny Price said. 

The FIU pitching attack was led by Arthur Santos (4-7), who tamed the Indian offense, allowing only two earned runs in 6.1 innings of work.

"Arthur had a really good outing. He did a really good job for us," said Price.

Derek DeCarlo came in to toss the final 2.2 innings, shutting down ASU, allowing no runs and striking out two for his third save of the year.

"Derek was as sharp as he has been all year" Price added. "He's really done a good job out of the bullpen."

FIU scored early in the second on a RBI single by James Bacon (2-for-4, RBI) to give the Panthers a 1-0 lead.

With the score tied at one in the third, Fernando Alvarez (1-for-3, RBI) singled home Diaz to reclaim the lead 2-1.

The Golden Panthers tacked on another run in the fifth on a sacrifice fly by Ricardo Nanita to make the score 3-1, before allowing three runs, two unearned to ASU in the sixth, putting FIU down 4-3.

But Diaz wouldn't be denied in the sixth, knocking the ball off the left field scoreboard with Bacon on third.

Price added: "Some guys just step up in the playoffs, and that's exactly what Dennis did."

Game Three - FIU 14, USA 11

Solomon Frieder and Ricardo Nanita combined for six hits and seven RBI as the Golden Panthers outslugged the Jaguars 14-11, dodging elimination for the second straight game Friday afternoon at "Tigue" Moore Field.

FIU added six runs in the fourth inning and four more in the sixth, and got a good enough performance from junior Luis Gazitua, who lasted seven innings, his longest start of the season.

"It was crucial to get seven innings out of Gazitua," head coach Danny Price said. 

"Everything was clicking for us offensively, and it helped that we gave Luis some run support," Price added.

FIU got three runs in the first inning, two of them off a triple by Nanita, to give FIU a 3-0 lead.

After allowing three runs in the third, the Golden Panthers responded in a big way in the fourth, dishing out six runs on five hits, capped by back-to-back run scoring hits by Nanita and Frieder, and putting FIU up 9-3.

Tim Land and Brett Parker added a RBI double apiece for USA in the bottom of the fourth to cut the lead to 9-5.

But FIU exploded again in the sixth inning, putting the Jaguars away with four hits on three runs, led by a RBI single by Michael New with the bases loaded, giving FIU a 13-5 lead after six innings.

But Gazitua struggled in the eighth, before being relieved by Peter Kocur, who recorded two outs before allowing a three-run shot to the Jaguars' Cole Craig.

However, Derek DeCarlo entered the game up 13-9 and recorded the final four outs to preserve the FIU victory, to earn his fourth save of the year.

"I felt strong coming out of the bullpen, but I had to come in because if we lost, that was it. We would have been on the bus ride home," DeCarlo said.

Added DeCarlo: "We couldn't take any chances facing elimination." 

Game Four - WKU 8, FIU 3

After winning two straight games to fight off elimination, the Golden Panthers ran out of luck, losing for the second time in two days to the Hilltoppers Friday night, knocking FIU out of the Sun Belt Tournament.

FIU, unable to start Derek DeCarlo who had pitched earlier in the day, and without Andrew Edwards who didn't make the trip, turned to junior Manuel Monreal. 

But Monreal struggled, allowing seven hits and seven runs in 3.2 innings.

"All year the injuries hurt us, but there is nothing we can do about those things," head coach Danny Price said. 

Added Price: "We never got Edwards back, and then DeCarlo's injury happened. We just have to build it back up."

FIU was able to score first in the opening inning when freshman Luis Rivera, who tripled to lead off the game, was knocked home by freshman Bryan Pullin on a fielder's choice.

WKU answered back with two runs in the second when Kevin Bearden homered down the right field line, giving the Hilltoppers a 2-1 lead.

The Panthers tied the game in the third when Pullin (1-for-5, two RBI) drove home Rivera (3-for-5, two runs) for the second time, this time with a double to make the game 2-2.

But the Hilltoppers put the game away in the fourth, scoring five runs on six hits to make the score 7-2, and knocking Monreal out of the game.

"Western Kentucky can hit. They've been doing it all year long," said Price.

Adam Summerell hit a solo homerun in the fourth to draw within three, but that was as close as the Panthers would get.

Edgar Ramirez threw the final 5.1 innings for FIU, allowing only one run on two hits.

But WKU's Igor Roiberg came on in relief, and ended FIU's season with three shutout innings.

"Now we'll just have to sit by the  television on Monday and see what happens," Price said.

Headline: Baseball earns five All-Sun Belt Conference honors
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Four Golden Panthers were named to the All-Sun Belt Conference team this week, with Josh Banks and Bryan Pullin landing on the first team, and Derek DeCarlo and Ricardo Nanita settling in on the second team.

Shortstop Luis Rivera was also honored, as he was named Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year.

Banks, a junior right-handed pitcher from Arnold, Md., led the Golden Panther pitching attack going 8-2 with a 3.13 ERA, while leading the conference in innings pitched (100.2) and strikeouts (112), in addition to starting the season with 30 consecutive scoreless innings pitched.

"I think I pitched pretty well all year. All I tried to do was give my team a chance to win every time, and I think I did that," Banks said.

Pullin, a freshman from Sunrise, Fla., was named as the All-SBC first team's designated hitter, finishing the season batting .338 with seven doubles, 21 RBI, and six stolen bases.

"I was shocked by the news. I didn't expect it at all, but I'm very excited," said Pullin.

DeCarlo, a sophomore right-hand pitcher from Miami, Fla. (Southridge), was honored on the All-Conference team for the second consecutive year, after another perfect season, going 6-0 with a 3.57 ERA with 75 strikeouts in 75.2 innings, after going 11-0 last season.

However, this time DeCarlo was named a relief pitcher after being forced to the bullpen with a hip injury.

"I think even though the hip thing forced me to the bullpen, I really benefited by being able to come in and give strong innings to close out games for my team," DeCarlo said. 

Nanita, a junior center fielder from the Dominican Republic, led the Golden Panthers in almost every major offensive category including batting average (.372), runs scored (48), home runs (12), RBI (47), total bases (118), slugging percentage (.656), walks (38) and on-base percentage (.482).

"I thought I was going to make the first team," Nanita said.

"But I can't do anything about that. I don't really think about awards. I just play."

Rivera, FIU's freshman shortstop, led the team in hits (76), doubles (14), and is batting .338 with 44 runs scored, 41 RBI and 13 stolen bases. He also put together a 23-game hitting streak midway through the season.

Rivera's selection marked the second consecutive year a Golden Panther was named the conference's best freshman player after DeCarlo received the honor last season.

"I'm very excited about this. It feels good, but I didn't really expect it," Rivera said.

"But it feels good to be considered the top freshman in the conference," Rivera added.

The selections of Banks, Pullin, and Nanita mark the first time for each to be named All-Conference.

With the selections of Banks and DeCarlo, the Golden Panthers became the only ball club in the conference to boast two pitchers on the All-SBC team.

Headline: Baseball takes two of three in regular season finale
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
In an attempt to tune up before the Sun Belt Conference Tournament, the Golden Panthers hosted a three-game set with conference foe Arkansas State to conclude the regular season. By winning two of three, the Golden Panthers wrapped up the regular season with a record of 34-21 (10-10 Sun Belt).

May 16- FIU 4, ASU 3 (12 innings)

Yahmed Yema drew a walk with two outs and the bases loaded in the bottom of the 12th inning to lead the Golden Panthers to a 4-3 come-from-behind victory over the Indians at University Park Friday night.

FIU was carried by pitchers Arthur Santos and Derek DeCarlo, who combined to give up only three runs over 12 innings.

The Golden Panthers, who never led in the contest, fell behind 2-0 in the first when Santos allowed RBI singles to Dusty Sexson and George Sterner.

But FIU fought back in the bottom half of the inning when Skip Adams (2-for-5, RBI) doubled home Mike Lopez to cut the lead to one.

Dennis Diaz helped the Golden Panthers tie the game in the second inning. Diaz singled to start the inning, and then stole second and third base, before scoring on a wild pitch by ASU starter Jody Petty.

ASU reclaimed the lead in the sixth on a Zach Shipley single to right field, making the score 3-2.

Two Golden Panther seniors, Adam Summerell and Solomon Frieder came up big for FIU in the bottom of the sixth. Summerell led off with a double to right-center. Frieder then knocked Summerell home with a single up the middle, tying the game at three.

Santos left the game in the eighth after allowing three runs on nine hits, and striking out four, drawing praise from his coach.

"Arthur is getting better with every start. He's really been saving us down the line, picking up the slack, especially with Derek [DeCarlo] and Josh [Banks] hurt," head coach Danny Price said.

DeCarlo, who has been forced to the bullpen with an injured hip, picked up where Santos left off, holding the Indians to only one hit over the last 4.1 innings, striking out seven ASU batters and allowing no runs, to give Yema the opportunity to win the game in the 12th.

"That's the longest Derek has been [since the injury], so that's a sign we're on the right track," said Price.

DeCarlo earned the win for FIU, improving to 6-0 on the season and 17-0 in his FIU career.

"He's a pitcher, and that's the thing he knows how to do. You give him a chance to smell a win and he does it," Price said.

May 17- FIU 10, ASU 7

Josh Banks, in a rare relief pitching appearance, helped the Golden Panthers hold off a ferocious ninth inning rally by the visiting Arkansas State Indians, earning a 10-7 victory Saturday at University Park.

FIU, who tallied only six hits in the game, still managed to dish out ten runs on ASU pitchers Karnie Vertz and Brent Cramer, starting in the first.

Luis Rivera led off, reaching first base on a fielding error by ASU second baseman George Sterner. Mike Lopez followed up with a walk, and Ricardo Nanita singled to right, driving home Rivera. 

Skip Adams added another run, bringing home Lopez, with a sacrifice fly to left field, giving FIU an early 2-0 lead.

FIU starter Luis Gazitua, who mastered the Indian offense for most of the game, ran into his only serious threat in the third inning, capped by a Blake Denischuk homerun, giving ASU a 3-2 lead. 

"Luis gave us a real strong start that we really needed. He really stepped up," head coach Danny Price said.

But the Golden Panthers exploded in the third. Lopez reached first on an error, Nanita was hit by a pitch, and Solomon Frieder drew a walk, setting the table for junior Fernando Alvarez.

Alvarez (2-for-3, four RBI) crushed the ball over the left field fence, knocking the ball off the scoreboard, clearing the bases and giving FIU a 6-3 lead.

"I've been telling Fernando for two or three weeks, since the New Orleans series, that he was going to do something huge, and he did it," said Price.

FIU added another run in the fourth on a sacrifice fly by Lopez, increasing the lead to 7-3.

Nanita (2-for-3, two RBI) made it 8-3 in the seventh, drilling a solo shot to left-center.

James Bacon singled home another run in the eighth, then scored one at-bat later on a throwing error by ASU third baseman Coatney Brooks, putting the Golden Panthers ahead 10-3.

But FIU freshman closer Edgar Ramirez had his shakiest outing of the year in relief of Gazitua, allowing four runs on four hits, forcing Price to call upon his ace.

Banks, who has been FIU's most reliable pitcher this season, entered the game in the ninth with two on and two out, and got FIU out of the jam, forcing pinch hitter Josh Allison to ground out to end the game, earning his first save and giving FIU the 10-7 victory.

"Banks has been our Friday night star all season. We have two [aces] when Derek is healthy, and the way Arthur is pitching, we can have three, and that's crucial, especially with the [postseason] coming up," Price added.

Gazitua (2-2) earned the win for FIU, allowing only three runs on eight hits in seven innings.

"Gazitua's performance was much needed. We needed someone to come in and pick us up like he did. That's what we are going to need in the [Sun Belt] Tournament," said Price.

May 18- ASU 6, FIU 4

The Golden Panthers fell behind early, and couldn't overcome the slow start, falling in the regular season finale 6-4 to the Indians on Sunday at University Park.

ASU starter John Anderson dazzled the Golden Panther offense, holding FIU hitless the first six innings.

The Indians took the lead in the third inning when the Matt Rogelstad (3-for-5, three RBI) homered off FIU starter Manuel Monreal, giving ASU a 3-0 lead.

ASU's Neal Chambers made it a 4-0 game in the fourth with a RBI double, scoring Brooks Coatney.

Peter Kocur entered the game for FIU in the sixth, and ran into trouble in the seventh. After allowing a double to Rogelstad, Kocur gave up a RBI single to Zach Shipley, pushing FIU behind 5-0.

Derek Taylor relieved Kocur in the seventh, and allowed a RBI single to George Sterner, increasing the deficit to six.

Mike Lopez led off the seventh for FIU with a solo homerun to left field, FIU's first hit of the game, cutting the lead to 6-1.

"Lopez's homerun really helped us out. We couldn't get anything going until that at-bat," said head coach Danny Price.

Bryan Pullin followed Lopez with a walk, and Ricardo Nanita and James Bacon singled, loading the bases for Fernando Alvarez. 

Alvarez singled home Pullin, making it a 6-2 game.
 
Nanita then cut the lead to 6-3 when he scored on a wild pitch by Kevin Cutler.

Solomon Frieder then walked, and Michael New hit a RBI sacrifice fly to draw FIU within two.

But it wasn't enough.

"I think when you fall behind four runs, it takes you out of your game. We're a small ball team. We're not good at playing long ball, and that's what we had to do," said Price.

Monreal (2-3) took the loss for FIU, allowing four runs on eight hits in 5.1 innings of work.

We all have our opinions--blah blah blah...and they go on and on.  I admit I myself am guilty of this because I believed that my voice would be heard by someone who was just and who would do something to help alleviate my woes.

How wrong I was.  Complaining or voicing our opinions, whatever you want to name it, does not work for peons.  There will always be a peon who sides with the oppressor.  and, in this realm of living, we the peons will never win no matter how often we voice our opinion.  Furthermore, we peons do not have the emotional control our oppressors have so the deeper we try to resolve our predicament by voicing our opinions, the more emotional we, the peons will become, and thus we will be labeled as either incompetent, neurotic or psychotic--if not all.  I write this from experience--and although I promised I would never write again--I remember back to a part of the movie "Risky Business" when Tom Cruise states that "Sometimes you just have to say,'What the @*$&!'"  

A few questions to jeanne ali, employee and alumna from the english department: 
You seem to be a "knowing" person. Please clear the following rumor/truth. 

Are students interested in attending graduate school able to use an adjunct for the references required by universities to enter graduate school?--universities such as yale, harvard, or even the university of miami? are adjuncts letters of recommendation as strong as those of professors? will letters of recommendations from adjuncts be taken as seriously as those written by professors?

and, as for fiu students financial condition--one analogy-- 

just a few months ago--american airlines employees (flight attendants, lower level employees--what i called the oppressed) agreed to lower pay, restrictions on future pay raises and pensions, etc. to HELP save the airline. suddenly, the revelation arose that those in power (ceo's, etc.--what i call the oppressors) were above such conditions. instead of receiving cuts in their financial situation they enhanced their financial positions.  it appears that the responsibility of saving the airlines was possible only via the sacrifice of the peons while the oppressors continued "as usual." 

GET IT!

Official of Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe Gives Address 

JOHN SUAREZ, of Christian Democrat International, said that in recent days the Cuban Government had carried out one of its largest crackdowns ever against democratic opposition in Cuba. Homes were ransacked, books and computers confiscated and about 48 activists were arrested. During 2002 the number of assaults and arrests against independent journalists and human rights activists in Cuba had increased considerably. Taking advantage of the fact that the international community was primarily focused on the outbreak of war in Iraq, Cuban authorities had arrested dozens of non-violent activists in the past two weeks. 

There were hundreds of political prisoners in Cuba. These defenders of human rights were systematically denied medical and religious attention and were held in provinces far from their places of residence.

Begins Review of Civil and Political Rights 

JOHN SUAREZ, of Christian Democratic International, said the organization extended its solidarity to those nations subjected to political and cultural domination, as well as those which struggled against oppressive and totalitarian regimes. Democracy was the seed of liberty and development. Regretfully, there still remained many nations where even the most minor democratic indication did not exist or where leaders attempted to mislead with totalitarian systems disguised as democracies. How could democratic principles such as human rights, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, racial equality, and non-discrimination prosper if the fundamental pillar was not respected? 

Could one accept Zimbabwe as a democratic country? Could one accept Uganda, when there was only one political party that maintained in power its president? Was Equatorial Guinea a democratic country? Christian Democrat International denounced these abuses and asked these African Governments to cease practices which violated human rights.

Morning 

Hears Statement by the Chairperson of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child 

JANNET RIVERO, of Liberal International, said attention must be paid to the policy of the Cuban Government of detaining political prisoners. Some had been unjustly held for years, and recently there had been a wave of new repression against those advocating for human rights and democracy. The repressive policy of Cuba had not stopped since 1959 and was aimed at keeping people from enjoying their civil and political rights. 

Franciso Chaviano Gonzalez had been a prisoner of conscience for 15 years. Liberal International pointed out that a Government that denied civil and political rights to its citizens was not a legitimate Government. Liberal International called for the Cuban Government's repression of the Cuban people to cease. 

JOHN SUAREZ, of Christian Democratic International, said that more than 100 human rights activities had suffered searches, arrests and expedited trials in Cuba. Many had already been condemned to sentences of up to 26 years in prison for defending civil and political rights in the country. On 7 April 2003, Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet was tried without due process and today was facing up to 25 years in prison for defending human rights in Cuba. In Cuban prisons, political prisoners were denied medical assistance as a form of punishment for upholding their ideas. Highly dangerous criminals were used by State Security to attack imprisoned activities, as was the case of Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina, a young activities whose jaw was broken in three parts, and who was severely beaten on three more occasions before being taken to the hospital.

Headline: Parking Permit Fee increase ???
Subheadline:  
Author: AHERNANDEZ@CARNIVAL.COM
&nbsp;
Hello,

My main reason for writing to you is to make you aware, if your not already of the following...

As I was checking my FIU student emails, I came across one RE: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking from FIU's Associate General Counsel.  

In short, I was shocked and troubled to read that student parking permit fees are, or might, increase by 25%.  I am a bit ambiguous because the email itself is somewhat unclear.  Perhaps our student paper can shed some light on the subject? One thing I did understand is that the board of trustees has agreed upon the increase but why didn't anyone ask the students or make us aware prior to the email?

This proposed rulemaking came out of nowhere and without an explanation.  As a student I believe I should know where my money will go and how it will be used before a rule goes into effect.  Clearly parking is an issue at FIU but is that what the money will go towards?  Will there be an oversight board?

Can you or your staff help get us students some answers?

Thanks for your help in advance,

Headline: Strock hosts golf tournament to aid diabetes research
Author: Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
As he has done for the last twenty years, head football coach Don Strock held his annual golf tournament to benefit diabetes research. In total Strock has raised $1.5 million since he began hosting the event. 

The golf scramble was held at Miccosuke Golf and Country Club in Kendale Lakes Wednesday. 

"I've been involved with various charities before," Strock said. "After seeing how many families are effected by diabetes, although my family has not had a case, we decided to go in that direction."

The former Dolphins' quarterback raised $131,000 with the help of his coaching staff that includes former Dolphins Bruce Hardy and Tony Nathan. 

In addition to celebrities on hand, which, included Footy from Y-100, Jim "Crash" Jenson, and Dolphin ring of honor inductee Nat Moore-210 people signed up to play in the event. 

"The course was in great shape," Strock said. "The event was great."

Two auctions, a live and silent, were also part of the event. Among the items auctioned off were a Junior Seau autographed football, a Donovan McNabb jersey, and items signed by Miami head football coach Larry Coker.

Headline: Softball eliminated from first-ever Regional
Author: Steve Perhla and Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers' hopes of a trip to The College World Series ended abruptly last week when it lost its first two games in their regional in Lincoln, Nebraska. FIU finishes the season with a record of 37-27.

Miss. St. 4, FIU 2

The Golden Panthers got off to a hot start, getting four hits and an early lead in the first inning, but couldn't hang on, falling to the Bulldogs 4-2 in its first Regional game ever Thursday.

Stephanie Wolter, Cindy Turek, Kristen Perry, and Lindsay Tippings all singled for FIU in the first to knock MSU starter Jennifer Nelson out of the game and give the Panthers a 1-0 lead.

"It was really a positive thing for us to get four hits and knock their starting pitcher out of the game in the first inning, especially in our first Regional," head coach Kim Gwydir said.

But the Bulldogs answered back in the second when Jennifer Waterman doubled off FIU starter Amanda Nealer to score two.

"Amanda pitched a great game, but the umpires made some bad calls, which really made a huge difference, " said Gwydir. "There was one ball right in front of my right fielder that they called fair, and it was foul."

FIU responded in the fifth when Jennifer Owens doubled home Wolter to tie the game at two.

Said Gwydir: "Jennifer just killed the ball on that hit. She's been so clutch for us all year."

But MSU got to Nealer again in the bottom of the fifth. After walking two batters, Nealer allowed a two-run single to Blaire Brown, giving the Bulldogs the 4-2 win.

Creighton 3, FIU 1

FIU played its second game of the day, and faced Tammy Nielson, who notched her 20th complete game of the year for Creighton en route to a 3-1 victory on Thursday.

In going the distance, Nielson (20-6) controlled the Golden Panthers, allowing only five hits and one run, and striking out five.

Kim Gwydir's team made two errors in the game with two of the three Bluejay runs being unearned.

Creighton was able to draw first blood when Jenny Hunt drove in Melanie Dorsey from third to make it 1-0.

Jennifer Owens produced the Golden Panthers' only run in the contest when her groundout drove in Meagan Dontrich in the final inning. 

FIU was able to load the bases in that inning before Owens grounded out on a controversial call by first base umpire Michael Mazur, and Cindy Turek fouled out to left to end the game. 

"We thought Owens was safe at first, and that really hurt us," head coach Kim Gwydir said. 

However, the Golden Panthers stranded nine base runners in the contest.

"We just didn't score enough to win," added Gwydir.

Kendra Laminack (11-12) took the loss for FIU, allowing three runs on six hits in 3.2 innings, while striking out eight.

"I thought Kendra pitched very well. She also had to deal with another controversial call, but she did what we asked her to do," said Gwydir.

"It's huge for the program to reach the Tournament and it puts us in the country's elite. It really solidified us as a top program in the country, especially with the at-large bid. I'm very proud of the girls," Kim Gwydir said. "The girls really turned around the season that could of went down the toilet early."

"Next year we are getting Owens back, as well as our young pitchers, Kendra and Amanda, so that will be a plus," Gwydir said. "The hard part will be replacing our seniors. Those are some big shoes to fill."

On a bright note for FIU, Nicole Dubovik stole her 35th base of the season, setting a Sun-Belt conference single-season record.

Headline: Owens follows family's success, named NCAA All-Southeast Region first-team
Author: Daniel Izquierdo
&nbsp;
It would be nearly impossible to fathom that a member of the Owens family would not excel in athletics. In a family that includes two professional baseball players (her uncle was a top draft pick of the Boston Red Sox), a younger sister that has been breaking high school pitching records since she was a freshman, and a few more intercollegiate participants - Jennifer Owens is definitely leaving her mark amidst a long line of what is a very rich family tradition. Oh, and by the way, the records her younger sister Crissy has broken belonged to Jennifer not long ago.

This rich lineage has been a driving force for Owens, whose brother Henry Jr. is a relief pitcher for the Class A Hickory Crawdads in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Truth be told, she was happier with her brother's recent accomplishments than with her own. "I was real excited because I just spoke to him recently and he told me he threw 99 [mph]," said Owens, who had one of the best offensive seasons in FIU history this year. When asked about her own accomplishments; she simply replies with: "those are just numbers, right?"

Numbers are one thing, accolades are another. And Owens has her fair share. The elementary education major was recently named to the All-Southeast region first team by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association. This puts her on the ballot for first team All-America which is yet to be determined. The selection of Owens was a first in FIU history, who has only had a second-team selection in 2000 when Shannon Carey was recognized. "When my coach first told me at Regionals I was concentrating on the games," said Owens, a graduate of Braddock Senior high in 2000. "Now that I think about it, its pretty neat."

Owens led the Golden Panthers in hitting (.363), slugging (.461), runs batted in (39) and total bases (94). The junior third baseman was also among the team's leaders in stolen bases with 16, doubles (12), and fielding percentage (.974). Her hit total, 74, is an FIU regular season record. While her 117 RBI and 28 doubles give her a stronghold on the career records at the university, Owens says she doesn't think about it. 

"I just go out and have fun and whatever happens, happens. I expect myself to do well," she said.

The 2000 Miami Herald athlete of the year is hoping to eventually move on to either a graduate assistant position upon graduation or even a tryout with the United States Olympic team. After playing in the Canada Cup last year with Olympic teams the world over, Owens thinks she can play at their level. Owens and FIU teammate Amanda Nealer did not play much because they were late additions to the team. Owens, a member of the volleyball team, did however make the best of the opportunities that she was given in a tournament that included Olympic teams from the US, Canada, and Australia to name a few. Despite limited action, Owens homered in one of her at-bats. 

"We got to play against the top players in the world, and it was good to see that I could maybe play at that level," said Owens, who finished first on the volleyball team in blocks and second in kills this fall. "It was a good experience, just to be around that."

Headline: 'Why bother with the FCAT at all'?
Author: Javier Ruiz / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
"'But if the state adds too many exceptions,' she said, 'then why bother with the FCAT at all?'"

- The Miami Herald quoting Marion Cannon, Winter Park High School media specialist.

That's my question exactly: Why bother with the FCAT at all?

It can be argued that the FCAT, which requires 10th grade achievement from 12th graders, is not unreasonable, and in principle it ensures that graduating seniors have the skills required to earn a diploma. 

Supporters of the test, such as Gov. Jeb Bush and Education Commissioner Jim Horne, have even touted it as "the end of social promotion," the practice of promoting without regard for achievement. 

It's a slogan tinged with irony in light of the governor's brother, a monument to the achievements of social promotion, who supported a similar test as governor of Texas before taking the distinguished office of President of the United States. 

That statement is farcical, even. There are enough exemption clauses to this exit exam, as well as other exams such as the CLAST, to ensure that social promotion remains a powerful force in American society. 

Social promotion likely accounts for most of the Miami-Dade County school board. The old adage among teachers is that when a teacher is proven ineffective in the classroom, they're promoted away from the students.

 After several protests over the exam, including one at FIU's University Park campus, Gov. Jeb Bush pressed lawmakers to grant exemptions to high school seniors who have yet to pass the test, exemptions initially slated for the class of 2004.

The exemptions would be based on scores achieved in other national assessment tests, such as the SAT and ACT, and are modest requirements at best: a 780 out of 1600 on the SAT, or a 15 of 36 on the ACT would qualify a senior for an exemption. 

Of the 13,000 seniors not passing the exam, 4,000 lack the grades or the credits to graduate. That means only 9,000 students have the grades, but not the test results to graduate. 

Many of those are recent arrivals to the United States, such as Yu Fu, who came to the United States just two years ago. According to the Sun-Sentinel, Fu maintained a 3.4 GPA and scored a 1060 on her SAT, but has failed to pass the reading portion of the FCAT. 

Even putting aside students like Fu, and given the quantity of students taking the test - Miami-Dade County has one of the largest school districts in the nation - 9,000 is a very small number. It appears to me that grades have already done their job to curtail social promotion. Probably better than the FCAT could manage.

The test, which is administered to students in grades 3 - 10, has an even more impressive set of exemptions for third graders, according to a Department of Education press release.

A child in third grade who fails the test can be exempt from retention if they:

* Were previously retained twice

* Are ESE students previously retained

* Pass the Stanford 9 after summer 

  reading assistance

* Pass by completing a portfolio

Um, so they can be exempt only if they are retained twice? Isn't that the definition of social promotion? How exactly is this "the end of social promotion"?

The CLAST, to which any college student hoping to declare a major is subject to, includes the standard set of exemptions for students who meet requirements on the SAT and ACT, as well as GPA in select classes. But in addition to this, a college student may request a waiver for a subset of the CLAST if they have failed that subset four times.

So what is the point of exit exams?

When the defense of them as safeguards against social promotion crumbles, politicians point to these exams as useful diagnostic tools: "The FCAT remains a vital diagnostic and measurement tool," wrote Gov. Bush in a letter to Bishop Victor Curry, an organizer of the boycott against Florida orange juice, and other sources of funding in the state of Florida, such as the lottery and tourism.

But if it's a diagnostic tool, then why are students in the cross hairs here, and not, say, the schools?

According to "Frequently Asked Questions About the FCAT," a Florida Department of Education document, "...If a test is used to qualify a student for promotion or graduation, the student must be given due process. This means that schools must be able to demonstrate that the skills being tested are being taught. Lesson plans, texts, and curricular offerings all provide evidence that skills are taught." 

It's likely no coincidence that the schools where FCAT failure is highest are those schools most direly impoverished. 

And it stands to reason that those under funded schools struggle to teach the skills being tested on the FCAT, regardless of whatever texts and lesson plans are to be found in that school. A lesson plan cannot overcome a classroom with 50-plus students and one teacher.

The governor's "A+ plan" does nothing to mitigate this disparity either, fiscally rewarding schools who grade well and potentially harming those that don't (a voucher program is still in the works.)

What can be said of the overwhelming improvement of test scores? Testing expert James Popham, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles was suspicious of the improvements. "If it's a legitimate system, you expect to see incremental improvement over time, not wild jumps," Popham said in the St. Petersburg Times.

I chalk the effect up to a practice anyone who ever took an SAT prep course or an AP class in high school knows all too well: teaching to the test.

Though Madonna Wise, West Zephyrhills Elementary School principal, offered another explanation in the St. Petersburg Times article.    

Wise's school went from a "C" school to an "A" school, perhaps not coincidentally, the same year it qualified for federal funding for low income students.

"That helped us lower class sizes," Wise said. "That makes such a big difference."

So the bottom line in improving education, as it turns out, is the fiscal bottom line.

Want to see some improvement? Give these schools some money - after all Florida is the cellar-dweller in educational spending, so there's no way left to go but up.

Diaz' article unjustly critical of English Department


To the editor:

As both an employee and graduate of the FIU English Department, I feel strongly compelled to respond to Andy Diaz's article in the May 13 The Beacon concerning the state of FIU, and, specifically, our department. 

Yes, it's true that Dr. Butler Waugh's retirement signals an end of an era. Dr. Waugh, a Founding Professor, will be sorely missed, and he certainly brought an outstanding quality of teaching to students throughout his many years at FIU. 

Additionally, Diaz is correct to bemoan the sorry budget situation that has curtailed such vital needs as photocopying, and which will probably get worse before it gets better. 

However, his opinion of our adjunct instructors is way off target. The English Department adjuncts are not, as he implies, teaching aides, but professionals who do an excellent job, with very little recognition or compensation. 

All our adjuncts are qualified teachers, with years of experience, who simply have not found full-time positions in South Florida's meager job market, so they often teach at two or more colleges or universities in order to make a decent living. 

Their positive student evaluations indicate that they are appreciated and teach with creativity and skill. To refer to these instructors as "ersatz" and their classes as "insipid" (read: fake and boring) is a disservice not only to the English Department, but also to FIU itself. 

Yes, we will miss Butler Waugh, but we have many other outstanding full-time and part-time professors who see to it that his departure does not leave our students out in the cold.

Student cries going unheard; tuition, textbooks too expensive



To the editor: 

I am writing concerning the financial burdens faced by students. The price of attending college seems to be accelerating rapidly. The start of a new semester seems to mean a rise in tuition and in the already ridiculously overpriced text books. Students are becoming more and more frustrated and are crying out for help, but no one seems to hear them. 

Students are forced to work several jobs just to keep up with the cost of attending school. This is very hard as it leaves no time for studying. As a result, many students end up failing classes and others simply become overwhelmed by the situation and give up. Sponsors need to come forward and assist both the students and the various universities so that tuition can be kept at a cost that makes college accessible for all students. Also, the universities themselves need to try and help the students by seeking alternative methods of making revenue other than raising the tuition rate. 

The owners of the university bookstores also have a vital role in helping to lessen the costs placed on students. The text books sold at the university bookstores are outrageously priced. A book can cost you as much as one hundred dollars. Even more ridiculous is the price the bookstore offers students to buy back their books. I recently heard a fellow student at FIU complaining that the bookstore only offered her $22 for a book she paid over $100 for. Measures need to be taken to regulate the prices of texts.

 I hope there is at least one person out there who has the guts to stand up and help us.

Headline: Syllabi system unfair, students should not pay
Author: Lissette Asencio / Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
The first thing that I think of when I think of school is the syllabus, because it runs my life for the entire semester. Whether I go out or study, work 20 hours or 10, or even whether I put off washing my hair, saving 30 extra minutes to finish homework - the syllabus runs my everyday life. It's my daily planner. So when I had a professor inform me that she could not give me a syllabus, I was appalled.

The reason I was given for not getting a syllabus was that FIU's budget cuts did not allow all of the professors the resources to print copies of it for their students. Another explanation was that FIU was moving to the web to make students more internet-friendly. 

I was OK with the "internet-friendly" version of the explanation because I am fortunate enough to have a computer, but others aren't. The ultimate shock happened the day I was required to pay for a syllabus. 

I took a class and the professor informed me that I would have to purchase my syllabus at the Copy Center. The actual fee was not the issue since it was less than a dollar. My problem was finding the time to go to the Copy Center and wait in line to purchase it.

A syllabus is something the professor makes to inform the students of what to expect. It has the their grading scale, expectations for the class, and don't forget the due dates. Also, who can forget the required attendance policy? Why should the student have to pay for something they need to be informed about?

This professor later said she needed to make some necessary changes to the syllabus. She verbally gave us the changes, but if we wanted a clean copy, we'd have to re-purchase it.

The determining factor for whether you receive a syllabus, or not, appears to me, to be up to the department. Chairperson and Professor Michael McQueen of the School of Journalism stated that as far as his department goes, "(There) is no blanket prohibition against printing." He said that in his department, "Each professor received (a budget of) about $100 to cover any copying," on a copy key and it was "usually enough to copy the syllabi." 

Carmela Pinto McIntire, chairperson and associate professor of the English Department, said that it probably depends "more on the college." Her college (College of Arts and Sciences) told her that, "We could give out one sheet, double-sided," at no charge. She also said, "We can duplicate exams at the Copy Center. We don't have to pay for that, but you need to (notify the Copy Center) in advance."

Although McIntire states that her college can print syllabi, she admits that any other type of printing, such as a syllabus that is longer than one double-sided sheet, is not provided for. "What I've been doing is paying for it. That's the way I've been handling it," she explained. She also acknowledged the fact that the budget caused some restrictions over various areas. "There are really strict limits on what we do in this department."

My question is: should students, or professors for that matter, have to pay for a syllabus? My answer: no. The syllabus is a contract between you, and the professor, as one of my professors once said. FIU should provide sufficient resources for professors to work. If I have to adhere to a set of rules, I should be told what they are without having to pay for them. 

If FIU expects me to perform my duties in a certain way I think that I, at least, deserve to be told what they are without making me or the professors have to open our wallets.

Headline: FCAT results positive, but questions abound
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Fortunately for Gov. Jeb Bush, FCAT scores released Thursday show improvement across the board.

Those scores will help Bush defend himself from criticism on the controversial exam and help defuse the push by opponents of the exam for a boycott on state income sources.

While the test results are positive - the highest in the exam's five-year run - they still reveal some problems that lend credence to what the critics are saying.

Miami-Dade County, the nation's fourth largest school district, set the low among all metropolitan areas of the state, marginally better in some cases than rural areas, and ranked in the lower 10 of the state's 67 counties. Even so, the scores, low as they were, improved over last year's scores.

While more detailed analysis has yet to be completed, it is evident that Miami-Dade County, with its many challenges, finds itself disproportionately affected by the test.

Many factors may be contributing to the discrepancy: the large immigrant population and high levels of poverty chief among them.

Miami-Dade County is forever awash in wave after wave of immigration. The result is a constant influx of limited-English-proficient students.

Common sense dictates that these students will struggle with the reading portion of a timed exam, regardless of how well those students may demonstrate their skills in the classroom.

Poverty, is also likely a factor. The Miami-Dade district is one of the largest in the nation. It is overburdened and under funded, resulting in overcrowded schools that lack the facilities and manpower to compete with other districts.

The tension that this has caused within the Miami community is already apparent: the line has been drawn between the "haves" and the "have nots," straining the already fragile relationship between socio-economic strata and ethnic groups. A boycott is imminent. 

Still, improving scores can't be a bad thing, and the accountability that the governor's "A+ Plan" has brought to the table has forced school administrators to abandon complacency, or face very real consequences. 

The goal of the plan, of which the FCAT is an integral component, was to "leave no child behind." Does the one-size-fits-all nature of the FCAT achieve that goal? That remains to be seen.

Headline: FIU Alumni helps organize Human Rights Protest in New York City
Author: By Stephanie Leavitt
&nbsp;
While the city of Miami is loaded with anti-Castro sentiments, the scenario in New York City is quite different.

FIU alumnus Raquel Aspuru and three other Cuban American professionals, Melissa Lorenzo, Arlene Delgado and Aryam Vazquez Martel, decided it was time for NYC to host an anti Cuban government rally.  

Aspuru graduated from FIU in 2001 with a double major in English and Women's Studies, and a minor in Psychology.  The skills she learned while attending FIU helped her in organizing the rally, Aspuru said.

The idea for a rally sparked when Lorenzo walked past the Cuban Mission, which, according to Aspuru, is an agency composed of Cuban employees from Fidel Castro's regime, located in the borough of Manhattan, and saw a small group of elderly men protesting in front.  

"They were so small in numbers that I felt bad for them," Lorenzo said.

After Lorenzo witnessed the small protest, she, Aspuru, Martel and Delgado joined together to form a human rights organization that they called the Coalition for Cuban Freedom. 

The coalition sent out a press release in both English and Spanish that emphasized violations of human rights that the organization says is occurring in Cuba. With the recent executions of three Afro-Cubans, who attempted to hijack a ferry to freedom, and the imprisonment of more than 70 government opponents taking place in Cuba, the coalition felt it was time to gather and "call for a new regime that will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms," according to the press release.  

The group also contacted the Cuban American National Foundation's New Jersey office, the Cuban Cultural Center in New York, and Mothers Against Repression, a Miami-based organization.

Still, gaining the support of large human rights organizations proved difficult.  

"A lot of [organizations] did not want to affiliate their organization with any political demonstrations," Aspuru said. 

Although the coalition hoped to receive financial support to help pay for the flyers or web site, the group was disappointed with the results.

"Only a few board members from the Cuban American National Foundation attended the rally, while the Cuban Cultural Center and MAR helped with passing along the press release and information," Aspuru said.

The group also received hate mails from anonymous individuals and was called derogatory names via their web site.   

But even with lack of support, hate mails, and police barricades on the day of the rally, no one was able to stop the protestors on May 17.  

Protestors rallied on the corner of 39th Street and Lexington Avenue, in front of the Cuban Mission offices in Manhattan.  

Opposing groups, the Pastors for Peace and International Action Center, organized a counter protest only two blocks away from the rally, yelling names such as "Guzanos" and "Miami Mafia" at the coalition protestors.  

The Cuban officials working inside the Cuban Mission building attempted to drown out the protestors by blaring loud music.  Still, Aspuru and the others chose to deal with the situation with humor instead of anger.

"We tried to request that they play Willy Chirino, but to no avail," Aspuru said.  Although optimism was high with a projected 500 people attending the rally, only about 220 protestors showed up. 

"It doesn't seem like so many people, but remember that New York is a tougher city for us 'hard-liners' to gather in," Aspuru said.  

According to Aspuru, the protest was a success.

Protestors left with "a sense of hope that they can rally together and perhaps make a slight difference in attitudes towards Cuba," Aspuru said.  

Like Aspuru, Lorenzo and Delgado are originally from Miami, while Martel emigrated from Cuba to New Jersey during the 1980s.  

The coalition has started a web site with links to news and current events related to Cuba and human rights violations.

Headline: Condo project cuts close to BBC
Author: By Jacquelyn Moody and Sarah Rodriguez / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
The City of North Miami has begun the construction of a condominium and hotel development at the entrance of FIU's Biscayne Bay campus, on the corner of Bay Vista Boulevard and US-1.    

The property where the FIU entrance sign is situated belongs to the City of North Miami and has recently been cleared for the construction of Biscayne Landing, a $1 billion condominium and hotel development. 

The developer of the project, Michael Swerdlow of the Swerdlow Boca group, has attained a 200-year lease for the property from the City of North Miami.  

Swerdlow is also conducting a traffic study about the amount of north and southbound traffic in and out of BBC, according to Nicholas Diciacco, executive director of Business and Finance at BBC.  The study will determine what measures the City of North Miami will take in order to facilitate the flow of traffic, though there is already talk of eventually widening 151st street to ease the traffic flowing into FIU.

"We have supplied them with the zip codes of students and faculty to give an idea of which direction everyone would be coming from," Diciacco said. 

Despite these efforts to assess the traffic situation, some students are still concerned that traffic will only worsen.

"I always preferred the [Biscayne Bay] campus because it rarely ever has traffic," said sophomore Monique Sampedro.  "Pretty soon it's going to be as impossible as the [University Park] campus, especially with all the construction that will be going down." 

  The project will require 220 acres of land, only 20 more acres than FIU property takes up, and will span US-1 from northeast 137th street to 151st street.

"I didn't even know you could build another building there," said junior advertising major Evelyn Perez.

The development construction consists of two phases. The first stage of phase I will relocate the FIU sign from the southeast corner of US-1 to the northeast corner.  

It will also consist of constructing a sales office and a condominium community with buildings ranging from two to four stories tall.  

Phase II, however, will be more extensive and will consist of the building of 25-story condos that will accommodate 7,000 to 10,000 residents. The property will house an approximate 5,000 condominiums.   

The project will take approximately seven to ten years to complete.  Because the project takes up a large tract of land and will take quite a while to finish, the City of North Miami and FIU raised  some environmental concerns.  The primary concern was that some of the property was a landfill.

Another potential issue was that the land cuts very close to a wetland preserve, but because there will be no building on the actual preserve, says Diciacco, there is no real cause for concern. According to Diciacco, as of press time, the project is currently on hold until the constructors attain the proper permits, but will resume any day now.

Even with the traffic and environmental matters raised, the construction may serve as an asset to the inconspicuous BBC. 

"Maybe the new high-rises will bring more attention to [BBC] and this area in general," said junior Kevin Jimeno.

Headline: Student Government holds second election
Author: Asra Jawaid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
University Park's Student Government Council held elections during its meeting May 21, in order to replace council members found ineligible of occupying the positions they won during spring elections.

The election, which only SGC members participated in, replaced Lower Division Representative Djenny Derane and Housing Rep. Philip Hamilton. College of Architecture Rep. Jennifer Fransen was also removed from office but her position has not  been filled because no one has applied.

"Students were relieved of their duties because they didn't meet the standards of the SGA constitution," said UP-SGC President Clayton Solomon. 

Derane and Hamilton were unseated at the completion of the spring semester. Fransen could not remain at her post because she still awaits full acceptance into the College of Architecture, which is a requirement for the position.

"[Fransen's] a senior, so when she applied for the position, we assumed she had been fully accepted to the school. Only later did we find out that this wasn't the case," Solomon said.

UP-SGC elected Jessica Franchi-Alfaro as lower division representative and Tarik Jallad as housing representative. The new representatives will occupy these positions until the fall semester, when SGA will sponsor another election open to all FIU students.

"Nobody outside of SGA knows that I couldn't be [lower division representative], so I'll run again in October [against the temporary replacement]," Derane said.

This is not the first time that the council overlooked certain aspects of a candidate's background. 

"It happens every semester," said Vicky Owles, SGA advisor.  "Vacancies open up all of the time." 

Solomon stressed that none of the representatives were disqualified in the traditional sense of the word. In order to be disqualified, a candidate must be in explicit violation of the election code, and this was not the case.

According to Owles, these positions sometimes open up because individuals drop classes or realize that they have too many other commitments. 

Grades may also be a reason for council members to prove ineligible, Solomon said.  Winners' grades are usually checked before the spring elections and again before fall. Solomon is the first SGA president to check on students' grades immediately following the end of the spring semester.

"We don't want to remove anyone, but we must make sure that all of the rules are being followed," Solomon said.

 SGC also elected Omar Castillo as its judicial chair and David Medina as student union chair.

Biscayne Bay Campus SGC President Nicaise Parillon said their elections went smoothly; no re-elections were needed.

Headline: FCAT demonstrators rally at UP campus
Author: By Adriana Oliva/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The ongoing fight against the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test was brought to FIU May 22, when protestors held a rally in front of the University Park campus' DM building.

"We chose to bring the rally to FIU because Governor Jeb Bush has a satellite office on this campus," said Frederica Wilson, senator of Miami District 33 who helped to plan the event.

Protestors say the purpose of the rally was to let everyone know how unfair the FCAT is, and that something needs to be done about it.

"We want the test to be suspended and the punitive punishment stopped," Wilson said. 

Most people at the rally agreed that one test should not make or break a student. 

"There are other criteria that should be considered, such as grade point averages and other involvement," said Michael Pames, City of Miami council member. "Besides, some students are horrible test-takers and freeze up, which shouldn't be counted against them."

Over 13,000 high school seniors will not graduate because they did not pass the FCAT, according to the Tallahassee Department of Education. 

These students can choose to take the GED (General Educational Development) exam to obtain a high school equivalency diploma or take a summer FCAT course, and retake the test.

"Some schools aren't even having a summer school session because of lack of money. So how is it expected that our kids retake the test?" protested Pames.

Teachers and parents are concerned that there is not enough preparation for the test, and that time and money is very limited. 

But some FIU students, such as junior Cristina Coniver, say that if protestors want a solution, then students should be in class, rather than at a protest rally in the middle of a school day. 

The outcomes of this test are affecting high school students in various ways. Some seniors complain of having to readjust their post-graduation plans.

Aisha Macfield, a senior at American Senior High School, planned to attend the summer session at Florida A&M University. Because she failed the FCAT by two points, she can not attend. 

Some parents say they are worried that their children will rebel and resort to criminal acts because of such discouragement. 

"I strongly believe that this is putting in motion [a reason for] students to no longer care and resort to wrong paths leading them to the streets, jail and their death beds," said Valerie R. Grace, parent and pasteur's wife of God's Total Ministry. Grace says she experienced a similar situation in 1979, when the Function Literacy Test was mandatory. Many seniors did not pass and were not going to graduate, Grace said. Still, the fight to suspend the test was won. 

"My brother was one of those seniors who failed. Now, he is an engineer making over $100,000 a year. Imagine what would've happened if he didn't graduate," Grace said.    

Protestors also argued on behalf of people that come from foreign countries and do not know the language well enough to pass the test.

"It's not fair to penalize them for not knowing the language if they know the material," Grace said.

Others  argue that in order to graduate from an American school, it is necessary to know English.

"If you are going to come live in the United States and expect to graduate with a high school diploma from an American school, then you should be able to speak the language," FIU junior Beatriz Manyoma said. "If you can't, then you shouldn't be allowed to pass."  

Governor Jeb Bush did not attend the event, and, for now, there is no resolution. 

According to Susan McKinnon, the associate vice president of Enrollment Services, FIU has not yet been affected by the FCAT results.

Headline: Graham Center gets makeover
Author: By Tony Metzelar/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The expansion and renovation of the Graham Center has begun and is expected to be completed by August or September 2004.

According to Pablo Rodriguez, GC's assistant director of operations, the main reason for the construction is to  enlarge the food court and to expand and relocate different student organizations  located within GC. "FIU is growing, and the Graham Center administration and Campus Life offices need to be bigger," Rodriguez said.

 GC facilities that needed previous work will also be improved. There were problems with leaks in GC's computer lab, Rodriguez said, and the lab has been moved to the second floor until summer 2004, while the space is remodeled at ground level.

Kaufman and Lynn is the general contractor and MC Harry & Associates is the design firm in charge of the project. The project consists of approximately 36,000 sq. feet of new construction to the existing facility.  About 30,000 sq. feet will be additions and expansions, and 6,000 sq. feet will be interior remodeling.  The total construction will cost approximately $5.1 million. 

According to Felicia Townsend, the associate director of business services, the expansion will include new food kiosks on the  ground floor, with enough room for more tables. There will also be a stage for bands and a place to dance.  On the second floor, there will be rooms for the SGA offices, Campus Life, and other Student Affairs offices, with a view of the new atrium. 

On the first floor, the existing mini-mall corridor will be extended towards the north, where the outdoor blue tables used to be, Carrasco said.  The blue tables have already been moved from the north end of GC to the main entrance. Although the changes are supposed to provide an improved GC, not all students express a positive outlook.  

"The blue tables behind GC were essential for the students to socialize, to study and to sit outside between classes," said sophomore Lilly Gonzalez.    "The fact that they were behind GC [made it] the perfect location. Plus, the scenery is nicer here (where they used to be); you don't have all the cars and garages that aren't really that nice to look at." 

James Wassenaar, the director of housing and finance, who works on behalf of Student Affairs, said the students need to realize that the new space is made for the students and for student support services.  

"With the completion of the additions, I would argue that our Graham Center will be the finest student center in the state of Florida," Wassenaar said.  There are some students  who do express positive feedback about the changes being made to GC.

"I think that it was a good idea to put [the blue tables] here in the shade," said junior Joyania Reyes, who started using the tables ever since they were moved to the front of the campus.   

The current plans are to reopen Burger King and relocate and expand Subway because, according to Townsend, the lines are too long in such a small space.  Caribbean Café and Bene's Italian Restaurant are also to be added to the new food court. The cafeteria will also be expanded with more tables and restrooms.  

A new post office and a cover extending from the north side of GC to the ballroom will also be added.  

"The students can walk from the parking lot to the ballroom and everywhere in between and they won't get wet when it rains," Wassenaar said.

According to Carrasco, pedestrian and vehicular movements around the site is of critical importance.

"Since the existing Graham Center houses a multitude of student-oriented activities, the maintenance of pedestrian movement both into and around the building is being carefully considered, as well as the vehicular and truck access into the construction areas," Carrasco said.

attending fiu was actually the end of my life. one day the truth will come out. 

i've repeatedly sent this letter hoping it would be published but censorship is copious at FIU. and, as for the student newspapers the beacon, you are not the beacon--the beacon no longer shines the light on the truth.  change your name to the censors.  it is more becoming of you.

you may find errors in this letter--it is the quality education i received from fiu.  

there is a student named andy diaz who appears to be irate--but there is truth in his madness as there was in mine. at this point my madness has turned to insanity to the point that i believe we are in danger. and i believe all those that know me are out to hurt me-kill me.  the english department may have done andy in--the religious department and dean szuchman killed me. 

the adjunct point: it is not whether they are good teachers or not. and now with the increase in tuition by a mickey mouse university wanting to be a real university is insult upon injury or worse for the students. here is the real problem behind the adjuncts if this rumor is true. 

a question to jeanne ali who so gallantly supports her adjuncts (she has to keep her job and kiss butt after all) and who by the way is one of the people at the english department who treated me with most cruelty when she was the secretary there: You seem to be a "knowing" person. Please clear the following rumor/truth. 

Are students interested in attending graduate school able to use an adjunct for letter of recommendation to universities such as yale, harvard, or even the university of miami? are adjuncts letters of recommendation as strong as those of professors? 

and, as for fiu student's financial condition--one analogy-- just a few months ago--american airlines employees (flight attendants, lower level employees) agreed to lower pay, restrictions, etc. to HELP save the airline. suddenly, the revelation arose that those in power (ceo's, etc.) were above such conditions. it appears that the responsibility of saving the airlines was possible only via the sacrifice of the peons while the oppressors continued "as usual." don't be surprised to find out madique lives in his mansion for free and received free meals--his soldiers live across the road in a supossedly called frat house.  

as for the girl who came from another university ouside miami and returned home and feels oh so comfy now that she is close to mommy who makes her home made meals -- i am sooo happy for you little girl.  i only feel sorry for you when you wake up to the real world.  of course, you probably won't since now they will use you as an example on how andy and i are insane and how fiu (FIC) really works.

GET IT! we peons are doomed and fiu is not what it appears to be. the originators of this university had something different in mind from what it has become. it is not a univeristy but a corportation. who will pay for the expansion of gc, all the new development? the students and some of the professors!  for this supposedly execellent school is full of adjuncts just arrived out of cuba plus those who can't make it in the real world. most of the times students can't even understand these adjuncts because of the thick accents. i'm cuban-so i'm not being racist. i'm just speaking the truth. besides, adjuncts are so much cheaper and easier to manipulate then professors.  

FIC--if you want to get me for telling the truth, you've already taken all that was worth anything to me.  FIC to me florida international corporation. 

i'm sure the editor will not publish this letter either. it doesn't matter. soon, the truth will come out. 

i speak out of frustration, depression, confusion, and severe emotional distress caused by FIC AND ITS BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN MY DOWNFALL.  THOSE IN RELIGIOUS STUDIES KNOW.  THE ONE PLACE YOU WOULD THINK HARMONY WOULD BE FOUND--DROVE ME NUTS---NO EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY THERE--NOT EVEN FROM MR. KNOW-IT-ALL KOAN.

ENOUGH SAID...THOSE WHO SEE BEWARE, THOSE WHO DON'T YOU WILL SEE SOON ENOUGH.  IT IS TIME!
