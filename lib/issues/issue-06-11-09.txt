Headline: DISAPPEARING ACT: Number of laptop thefts on the rise
Author: Maria Chercoles / Asst. News Director

Ling Wang,  was using her laptop in the Green Library's second floor on a Friday around noon a couple of months ago when she felt hungry and decided to go to the vending machines in the Graham Center for a snack.

She was in an isolated corner, but she could see other students around her, so she didn't see the need of asking them to look after her things because she was not going to take more than five minutes. However, when she got back her laptop and rolling case had disappeared.

"The students right behind my desk told me they saw a young guy taking my stuff, but they didn't stop him because they didn't notice that I was sitting there earlier and thought he was the owner," Wang, who is majoring in nursin, said. 

Wang is not the only one who has gone through this situation.

According to Public Safety, there has been a rise in the number of laptops reported stolen this year. So far this year there has been 56 reports of stolen laptops, compared to 36 in 2005 and 23 in 2004. Last September, Public Safety reported the highest number of thefts in a month in the last five years, 10, which averages to more than two per week.

"I see it happen every week. Students come in asking me to call Public Safety and while they wait they break into tears because they've lost all their work. I feel terrible," said Frank Mendoza, student assistant of GL's second floor computer lab. "You'd be surprised how many people leave their belongings unattended. They have to understand this is a public library and anyone can get in."

Concerned with the recurring number of laptop thefts, Mendoza has taken the issue as a personal cause. In his free time, he walks around the library and every time he sees an unattended laptop, he leaves a notice warning students about not leaving their belongings unattended.

"I'm always telling students to take their things with them. The false security they get that just because there's people around no one will take their things is a misconception," Mendoza said. "If someone takes a bag or laptop, everyone else around will just assume he or she is the owner."

Last June, Public Safety conducted an investigation that resulted in the arrest of a student, and after his interrogation, clues led to a second arrest of a man who was not part of the FIU community at all, and who is now in jail.

"Although the two people we arrested were involved in a couple of laptop thefts, I think that most of the times the crime is committed by people who just see the opportunity to steal the laptops," said Law Enforcement Acting Captain Alphonse Ianniello. "I would not say it is organized crime."

Although there are some security cameras in the library, they are not located in the study lounges where most thefts occur, which could prevent the crime.

In an attempt to stop the thefts, Public Safety sends out flyers once in a while with suggestions on how to keep personal belongings safe. It has also hung up signs in the library that read, "Library security notice: Laptop thefts" and list recommendations.  

Mendoza believes Public Safety's warnings are not enough.

"There are still students who have no idea of the number of laptops stolen each week. After they file a police report, nothing happens. I wish we could do something more, but anything else besides warning students is Public Safety's job," Mendoza said.

"When I called the police, the officer told me never to leave my stuff unattended in the library, but I thought it was a safe place," Wang said. 

According to Ianniello, Public Safety is still investigating and considering ways to stop the theft.

Headline: Homecoming week about to kick off
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Whether you're walking through the halls of the Graham Center or across the Housing Quad, chances are that you may have noticed the large banners promoting "Fire It Up."

Organized by the FIU Homecoming Council, "Fire It Up" is the theme for this year's Homecoming week held Nov. 13 to Nov. 18.

The week's festivities kick off Nov. 13 with two events. The first is "Wear Your Blue and We'll Feed You," a barbeque which will take place at noon in front of University House.

The second, "Panther Prowl," is arguably the biggest event on the Homecoming calendar, according to Homecoming Director Alex Ravelo.

The event will feature comedians Pablo Francisco and Bill Bellamy who will entertain students in the Pharmed Arena.

According to Ravelo, the Homecoming Council was originally looking for Dane Cook to headline the show but Cook was too expensive.

"Our agent got a listing of many comedians and how much they would cost," said Ravelo. "We looked at Dane Cook but he was way beyond our range. We decided to select Pablo Francisco and Bill Bellamy because of their quality and their popularity within our age group."

The Council starts planning the events over the course of the summer. 

"We started choosing all the positions for the committee in the spring and went on a retreat over the summer," Ravelo said. "That's when we started planning everything."

According to Paige Lapointe, public relations chair for the Homecoming Council, the idea for the theme was a group effort that was agreed upon by both the University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus homecoming councils.

"We were throwing around a couple of ideas and 'Fire It Up' was something all of us came to a conclusion," Lapointe said.

The only event held Nov. 14 is "LipSync" in the Pharmed Arena at 8 p.m., a competition that has become a staple of Homecoming over the past five years. During LipSync, various organizations prepare a five minute piece that goes with the theme of the event, "Fire and Ice".

"Moonlight Madness," a pep rally sponsored by Panther Rage, takes place Nov. 15, also at the Pharmed Arena at 8 p.m. The pep rally is meant to kick off the FIU men's and women's basketball season. 

"Homecoming used to be a celebration of the basketball season but we moved Homecoming to football after we got a football team," Ravelo said.

Students will be able to vote for their choices of  Homecoming King and Queen at the Graham Center Computer Labs throughout Nov. 16. This year, there will be six candidates each running for the title of Homecoming King and Queen. 

"The organizations selected their own candidates," Ravelo said. "It's open to all organizations but usually the fraternities and sororities are the only groups to send in their candidates."

The Council will host the second annual block party between the Blue and Gold garages Nov. 17 at 9 p.m., which will include free food, giveaways and music entertainment for the students.

The Homecoming Celebrations will come to an end Nov. 18 with the traditional Homecoming parade that starts at the College of Engineering, comes down 107th Avenue into FIU and ends at the football stadium.

"The parade this year will have floats, banners and fire engines from the Miami Fire Rescue," said Ravelo. "The FIU police worked with the City of Sweetwater to make sure everything goes smoothly."

The final event before the football game will be the football tailgate with a lot of activities including the usual - free food, giveaways and bounce houses. 

At the end of the tailgate, students will be given free gold shirts as they enter the stadium.

Both Lapointe and Ravelo hope that the week is a grand success and hope students take advantage of the events organized for them.

"This year is going to be great," said Lapointe. "We've worked very hard for it and we hope students enjoy the events."

Headline: More than a few bad Apples
Author: Shawn Sprockett / Asst. Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Congratulations. You've finally bought your first iPod. Great, isn't it? Listen to your favorite music for hours, wear those oh-so-trendy white earphones, pick out cute little covers for it to wear and-oops, what's this? Your expensive new music investment is broken?

Last year, a settlement against Apple won $50 vouchers and replacement iPods for nearly 2 million customers who had received defective equipment. With Apple reporting 14 million iPods sold as of its last quarter, the 2 million of last year's lawsuit make up nearly 15 percent of its total sales and suggest that nearly one in seven iPods were affected by the fatal battery error.

I've owned an iPod for almost two years. It already looks dated with its black-and-white screen, unimpressive 40GB hard drive and serious lack of video capabilities. My parents got it for me for Christmas at the ripe price of $400, and within five months we were back at the Apple Store trying to solve our very own "iProblem."

Luckily, we had paid extra for the Apple Care warranty and when the iPod's hard drive crashed one brisk morning, my family was able to resolve the problem with little difficulty - even though I was never able to recover the songs I had on it. After replacing the little pain,  I found out that my problems were not unique. Apple has had to recall an entire generation of iPods from a few years back because of faulty batteries that died in an hour instead of lasting the advertised seven hours. One of my friends is on her third iPod due to defects in the devices. Another friend is on number five. Apparently, they just keep breaking.

A web site, flawedmusicplayer.com, was recently set up by an outraged iPod Nano owner who had become frustrated with what he describes as a "design flaw."

"The iPod Nano is not really to be used. It is way too fragile," argues the web site. "Apple markets it in a pocket. Hell, Steve Jobs himself pulls it out of his when he announces it. My Nano broke on day four - the screen, that is. It shattered. It was in my pocket as I was walking and I sat down. No, I didn't sit on it. It was just in my pocket, just as all iPods before it have done and my cell phone, which also has a screen on the outside, does. This is what they were meant to do. That's why they make them pocket size," the web site said.

So here's my problem: why does a device so expensive and so poorly made continue to sell? Because Apple is the only company out there making large memory storage MP3 devices. No other company has a device that compares. Apple boasted an increase this year - from 53 percent to 68 percent - in its domination of the music player industry. This has left music lovers with little choice other than the risky iPods.

 If you aren't a serious music-listener, then don't bother with an iPod.  If you feel your wisest purchase was the debut of American Idol reject William Hung, then chances are you aren't quite ready for the expensive storing power of an iPod. 

For the rest of us, you may not have much of a choice but to submit to Apple and its monopoly over the MP3 market. Though a few competitors have risen like iRiver and Creative Labs, the industry is still eating out of the palm of Apple's hand.

 If you must buy an iPod, purchase the Apple Care warranty. I've only met a few who buy a new iPod and never have a problem with it. Those who use it for jogging should be especially careful because all that bouncing can mess up the hard drive. A personal contribution to that list: rain can mess it up, too. Those who value their money, but not their reputation, should consider sticking with that good old-fashioned CD player.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Bolivarian Youth has more support than article portrays
Author: Victor Maxwell / Junior / Physics Education Major / Bolivarian Youth, member 
&nbsp;
Concerning the article "Group tackles human rights issues" in the Nov. 2 issue: first, I am refreshed to see a story on social activism and local groups engaged in its causes. I am glad the author noted social justice events that the club has participated in, such as the freedom fight for Father Gerard Jean-Just, and the upcoming forum with Venezuelan foreign diplomat, Carlos Escarra.

However, I must criticize the portrayal of the group as one that elicits only negative reactions from the student body and administration.

In reality, the Bolivarian Youth has many on-campus and local supporters in Miami and elsewhere.

Although the groups' members may have somewhat controversial political beliefs, the work that the group is doing should be the main focus of discussion.

As a group, members have participated in events that bring food and shelter to the hungry, rights for workers and peace of mind to oppressed groups. The group has gained the recognition and appreciation of organizations such as Veteran's for Peace, Amnesty International, Jobs with Justice, the A.N.S.W.E.R. coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Haiti Solidarity Committee and the Association of Christian Women in Defense of the Cuban Family, as well as thanks from many poor and working class people.

Unfortunately, the article casts the group as radical and at odds with the local community.If the author was interested in controversy, than perhaps she should have written an exposition on those in our community who abuse legislative, judicial and executive powers in order to deny shelter to marginalized groups, and imprison innocent men and women under false pretenses. Instead, the article might possibly alienate like-minded people from joining a legitimate human rights group.

Headline: Editorial: Vendor contract gives students no options
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Whether they choose to purchase their meals at Fresh Food Company, Burger King or Subway, in the end, students who eat at FIU's University Park campus must buy food from the same single vendor. 

Aramark has a contract of exclusivity with FIU, making it the only company allowed to sell food on campus. 

This gives Aramark a monopoly over food sales on campus. As with all monopolies, this translates into one thing for students: high prices.

The price for a meal at the Fresh Food Company went up from $6.94 last year to $8.01 this year.

Felicia Townsend, director of business services, attributed the change to an increased cost of living. 

However, if Fresh Food's price increase had been proportionate to the change in the Department of Labor Statistics's Consumer Price Index, a meal would cost $7.21 this year, rather than $8.01.

The CPI for September 2006 was 2.06 percent higher that in September 2005. Meanwhile, the price of a meal on campus has gone up by 15.4 percent.  

Because students who wish to eat on campus have no choice but to buy food at Aramark-run venues, Aramark can set food prices at its leisure. 

There is no competition to offer a better, cheaper product.

Moreover, since the University began requiring housing residents to purchase meal plans, Aramark now has about 3,065 guaranteed customers - and that's only housing residents. Considering students living on campus make up only about 10 percent of the entire student population, Aramark's contract is a sweetheart deal.

Aramark, however, cannot be blamed for setting high prices. It is a business, it exists to make a profit. 

The office of business services is the party at fault.

By giving Aramark exclusive rights to on-campus food sales - and therefore a carte blanche in setting its prices - business services has chosen to favor corporate interests over the well-being of students.

Furthermore, Townsend hinted that there may have been cheaper alternatives to Aramark. She defended choosing the higher-priced Aramark over other bidders, but the reasons she provided were abstract and irrelevant. 

"Seven out of the 10 state universities use Aramark," said Townsend. She also called the company a "leader." 

It is doubtful that these dubious merits justify higher prices for already cash-strapped students.

Headline: Donor withdraws $20 million gift from University
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The man who gave FIU $20 million for its College of
Medicine initiative is taking the gift back, as
well as asking that the new college not be named after
him.

Herbert Wertheim - a BOT member and past chairman of
the FIU Foundation - sent a letter to University
President Modesto A. Maidique Nov. 8 announcing the
withdrawal, as well as his resignation from the board.

In the letter, Wertheim said his decision was
partially due to a recent confrontation he had with
Maidique over the way the donation - the largest donation in the University's history -would be disbursed.
Wertheim felt the payment should be made in four
installments of $5 million whereas Maidique wanted the
payment in one lump sum.

According to a university-wide e-mail from Maidique,
an agreement between the University and Wertheim
stipulated that the full amount of the gift had to be
made 30 days after the naming of the college.

The naming was announced during a BOT meeting Sept.
29.

Headline: Students tap into jobs by networking
Author: Eddith Sevilla / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
These days finding a fun and appealing job is not as tough as it may seem for college students on the prowl.

For freshman and occupational therapy major, Claudia Calderon, finding a job as an optometrist assistant at Sears Optical came by word of mouth.

"My friend Gaby came to see the doctor here and he asked her if she wanted a job, but she already had one so she called me and told me about it and here I am," Calderon said.

Calderon, who started working for Dr. Herman Deanna about five years ago, is responsible for an array of duties including taking patients' blood pressure, performing preliminary eye exams, checking for peripheral vision through a visual field screening and puffing air into patients' eyes with a non-contact tomography machine to check for glaucoma. Other job duties include filing, scheduling appointments and answering the phones.

Although Calderon is only a freshman, she is making the kind of money any other freshman can only dream of -  a whooping $16 per hour.

But the perks don't end there.

"You get free eye exams and you get insurance, those are the good parts," Calderon said.

However, not every job is perfect. 

"The bad parts are that you don't get any sick days, you don't get vacation paid and no holiday pay," Calderon said.

Being confined to an office for a certain amount of hours is not appealing to everyone, especially those like Antonio Smith-Morales, a junior majoring in language arts, who claims to have a humanitarian heart.

"I consider myself a humanitarian. I like to help people who are less fortunate than ourselves," Smith-Morales said.

Smith-Morales works for Fundraising Initiative, an organization that works for Mercy Corps to help raise money for charity in less developed countries, as a physical agent to get people to sign up and donate money at places like the mall.

"With this job, I'm able to have a voice for the helpless, people that are suffering, people that are poor. I like to help little kids, old people and anyone who can't help themselves," Smith-Morales said. 

According to Smith-Morales who found this job opportunity during a career fair held at FIU in September, the pay is more than $10 dollars per hour. Monetary bonuses are awarded after every two sign-ups while full coverage for health insurance is allotted after 3 months of full-time employment.

Sometimes students are lucky enough to start working in the field that they're going to school for before graduating.

For those who are into the arts, like high school student Vilma Vargas working at Sign Station in Westland Mall is an advantage.

"I like the designing part cause I like dealing with computers," said Vargas, who is looking into design for college.

While her title is sales associate, Vargas' job duties include designing car plates similar to state license plates, stickers and signs.

"Everything is done through the computer; what I can't do on the computer I have to do it," Vargas said.

When a customer approaches the station, Vargas gets to work on the computer using a program called Sign Wizard, and puts the design together asking the customer for their choice of color, font type, size and design. She then inserts a colored sheet into the plotter which cuts the design into the sheet. The procedure continues with Vargas peeling the unnecessary parts of the sticker and then transferring the design to a white sheet to prepare to place it on the plate.

"At the beginning it's hard [but] with more practice it gets easier," Vargas said.

The pay range for her position is an estimated $240 per week.

Like Vargas, Heather McCalla, an FIU journalism alumna who is now working for The Sun-Sentinel, started building her career as a freelance writer for The Miami Herald before graduating.

"I heard about it through a college friend who had graduated and made her living solely on freelancing. She was - and still is - working for The [Miami] Herald. She was overwhelmed with work, and asked the editor if she could recruit me," McCalla said.

According to McCalla, the pay range varies by story.

"The [Miami] Herald started my pay on stories at $50. Community news stories generally pay less. The Sun-Sentinel paid me at least $80 for my religion and community news stories, more if it was covered live or if I took pictures, which I do, too," McCalla said.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit: Offensive films set
Subheadline: A pop culture column
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This past weekend, the Borat movie surpassed all expectations and grossed more than $26 million at the box office despite playing in only 837 theatres, a number far less than its competition, which played in more than 2000 locations. With the film expanding into more than 2000 locations in the upcoming week, prospects of the film crossing the $100 million mark seem inevitable.

Obviously, word of mouth, glowing reviews and a brilliant marketing campaign played a factor. Also adding fuel to the flames was the x-factor in many recent left-field hits - controversy.

To say that the film will offend some sectors is an understatement. The government of Kazakhstan even took out a four page advertisement in The New York Times explaining to the public what the real Kazakhstan is like in order to avoid negative publicity. Too bad, because by doing this, they're actually creating more publicity for Sacha Baron Cohen and his nutty character.

Through the course of history, films have had the ability to shock, anger and inspire audiences. They've also had an important role in inspiring violence and controversy. Controversy could arise from anything ranging from religion, race, violence and sex. However, despite the baggage that comes with it, one thing is clear … it sells.

You can find controversy all the way back to D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation. Even though the film is considered a landmark film, it still remains explicitly racist. It's outright endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan and racism has come under fire almost every decade since its release in 1915. I find it stupefying that film professors give it a ridiculous amount of praise.

Sex has and will always be the most controversial element in cinema. Likewise with violence. Every year, films get more and more gory and violent. Apparently, the word around town is the more blood and lungs gutted on screen, the more money made.

Natural Born Killers, Basic Instinct, A Clockwork Orange, Brokeback Mountain and Deep Throat all have had their fair share of controversy.  I'm sure you've read more than a couple of stories on some of these films. More than enough has been said on sex and violence on screen so I will do you a favor by not starting.

Religion drives society so it's not surprising to me that Hollywood has once again realized the real power of religion in cinema. Take Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ - a film that was released amidst a storm of claims that the film was anti-Semitic.

Sections of the Jewish community boycotted and picketed the movie.

Nobody wanted to finance the film. Film pundits proclaimed that the film was a career-ending move for Gibson. Obviously, they didn't know what Mel Gibson would be doing this summer. The film grossed $70 million in its opening three days alone on route to more than $600 million worldwide. Never underestimate the power of Jesus - even if the film isn't even remotely good. 

Martin Scorsese's superior The Last Temptation of Christ released in 1989 attracted controversy mostly due to the sequence in the film where Christ is tempted by Satan while on the cross and is shown an alternate life in which he is married to Mary Magdelene with children.

That the film showed Jesus as a flawed, self-doubting and sometimes tormented individual was apparently too much for some religious zealots to bear. It seems to me that they missed the part in the Bible that mentions that Christ was a man as well.  

Ron Howard's painfully boring The Da Vinci Code is another example. Several catholic groups and Opus Dei groups called for its boycott. In India, and other sections of Asia, the film had to be released with a disclaimer stating that the film was only "a work of fiction." Thankfully it was! 

The premiere of Kevin Smith's Dogma drew hundreds of protestors and Kevin Smith stated that he received at least 300,000 letters of hate mail.

The Catholic League of America criticized studios Disney and Miramax for the film's blasphemy and satire of religion.

Again, these groups failed to understand the meaning of the term "satire."

Politics is also another touchy subject.

Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 practically divided the country in half when it debuted in the U.S. 

In the end, Moore, like Gibson, had the last laugh all the way to the bank.

Oliver Stone's JFK caused an uproar in 1991 because many people believed Stone's theories to be fact.

It led to a 1992 Congressional Act to release classified documents on the Kennedy assassination. Similarly, director Gabriel Range's recent Death of a President took Stone's ideas and presented a what-if theory of the assassination of George W. Bush.

Filmmakers are constantly raising the bar on what can or cannot be shown on screen.

Rules are broken, and guidelines are always changing.

More than half of the people who boycott the supposedly controversial films haven't even seen them. The only way to judge the controversial aspects is to watch the film yourself.

Headline: BACKYARD BREAKOUT: Local getaways reasonably priced in off season
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Living in South Florida, relief from school is never far away. From the snorkeling and tropical life of the Keys to the childhood indulgences of Tampa and Orlando, a quick weekend getaway is right in your backyard.


The Keys:
Our respite from our academic life begins to our south in the Keys. Although Key West is the most visited, closer and more affordable choices are available and just as fulfilling.

Bahia Honda State Park on Big Pine Key is perfect for those who want a tropical weekend getaway that's merely a stones throw away.

Three hours south of Miami, Bahia Honda State Park offers several white sandy beaches coupled with warm shallow water, the perfect combination to escape from reality. Boating, fishing, snorkeling and kayaking are also available at this park.

Although one can choose to stay at pricier hotels near the park, such as the $200-$300 a night Hawks Cay Resort in nearby Duck Key, smaller hotels at more affordable prices are available in the area. The Hammocks at Marathon runs as low as $100 per night and can prove very affordable if split between several friends.

Although cabins with full amenities that can house up to six people are available on park premises for a mere $140 per night, you have to book an astonishing 11 months in advance. For the getaway on a whim, area hotels are a much better choice.

If you're willing to drive a bit farther down through the Keys, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park on Key Largo offers some of the world's best diving and snorkeling.

The natural aquatic beauties of South Florida can be viewed at John Pennekamp either in their tropical lagoons or sea grass communities or while swimming through an early Spanish shipwreck approximately 100 feet offshore.

Snorkeling tours also depart three times daily from the park for a fairly small fee. Here you get 1 ½ hours of water time to see the park's offshore coral reefs at the U.S.'s first ever underwater national park.

Sunset Cove Beach Resort on Key Largo offers visitors cottages and smaller suites at reasonable prices.  Connectable rooms with two queen beds and three twins are $110 per night. Even their cottages with two queen beds and a full kitchen run for the same price. All this is on the waterfront while offering patrons a relaxing atmosphere and a stunning view of a tropical sunset.


Central Florida:
If it's the tropics that you want to get away from, head north to indulge your childhood desires and thrill-seeker wants.

Tampa offers some of the country's best roller coasters at Busch Gardens. Be a child again and experience their renowned animal adventures and refreshing water rides.  If you get there before the end of the year, they are running a two-for-one special. For $60, Florida residents can get a pass for two days.

Animal adventures with Jack Hannah are not for everyone. Upon admission to the park you can register to visit the Brewmaster's Club where you can sample everything from American lagers to full-bodied stouts.  It's advised to save the club for after the roller coasters.

Dingy motels are not the only option when in Tampa. Built in 1921, the Pier Hotel in nearby St. Petersburg was recently restored in 2001 and features cozy European décor.

This small hotel takes on the feel of a homely bed and breakfast and is available at affordable rates. A deluxe room with two double beds runs for $128 per night.  Fall discounts runs as low as $98.

Headline: Exhibit debates art work as modern or primitive
Author: Agustina Prigoshin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU's African New World Studies department and the Broward County Library hosted the event in the hopes of shining light on African art. 

Though some critics consider African art primitive, the symposium goal was to introduce it as another type of modernity.

 African-like paintings and sculptures greeted visitors in a small makeshift gallery at the Broward County Library's main branch in Fort Lauderdale. The library co-sponsored the event.

The symposium, entitled "The Idea of Modernity in Contemporary Haitian Art" was held to celebrate African Diaspora art, according to Akin Ogundiran, the ANWS director.

"African New World Studies aims to facilitate knowledge of the contributions made to art, and also showcase the artists' endeavors," Ogundiran said. 

"We hope to awaken neglected themes in the scholarship," he said.

According to Ogundiran, one of the goals of the department is be the center of education on African Diaspora art and be the avenue to bring students and the community closer to exchange knowledge. 

Modernity, in terms of art, took place mainly in 18th century Europe when the conversion of economic wealth and democracy was taking place.

Slavery was also a large aspect of modernity.

"For this reason, we chose Phillip Dodard to be the highlighted artist for the event. His work reflects modernity itself in his themes and style. He's very versatile and unique, while being inspired by African art," Ogundiran said.

Michele Frisch, owner and curator of Galerie Marassa, an art gallery in Haiti where Dodard's work is on display, is a personal friend of the artist. She offered a short and private tour of his work.

Dodard focused his work on nature, such as lilies and orchids, and painted them primarily in dark blue colors in the early '80s.

However, in 1989 he began painting portraits.

They resembled Picasso's cubism period

The exception was that the colors were more African and Haitian-based. 

During Haiti's political distress in the 1990's, Dodard began using black ink to depict the country's pain. 

He painted body parts, such as feet and hands, and hearts in the background to show his love for his country.

FIU professor Carole Boyce Davies, former ANWS program director, presented five invited speakers of varied in backgrounds to give their opinion of Dodard's work.

Slavery was the main theme of a lecture by Legrace Benson and Nkiru Nzegwu.

Benson serves as director of the Arts of Haiti Research Project and an associate editor of the Journal of Haitian Studies, while Nzegwu is an associate professor at Binghamton University.

Frank Etienne, a Nobel Peace Prize finalist in literature, spoke through a translator in French about modernity in Haiti and Dodard's work.

Greg Thomas, an English professor at Syracuse University and hip hop scholar presented another perspective in relation to Haitian culture.

"The Haitian revolution is an influential source in modernity," said Thomas.

Visitors in the gallery appreciated Dodard's understanding of modernity in his artwork.

"His art changes with the time so beautifully," said Jean Bernard Revolus, 39, who heard about the event on TV.

"I'm just blown away," said Laura Jacobs, 52, who heard about the event through a friend. 

"It's great to see an artist who has mastered so many different mediums."

Headline: Faculty Spotlight: Abdolrahim "Abdy" Javadzadeh Adjunct Sociology Professor
Author: Elayne Cardoso / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Tatiana Zyne, a senior majoring in liberal studies, did not originally intend to minor in sociology until she took Social Deviancy in the summer of 2005 with Abdolrahim "Abdy" Javadzadeh, an adjunct professor.

Since then, Zyne has not taken a sociology course with any other professor.

"With him, you really want to go to class and learn the subject so you can participate and you don't feel left out," Zyne said.

Javadzadeh, a professor in the department of sociology/anthropology, says he does more than teach - he welcomes being taught by his students.

"Teaching is also a way for me to learn. I learn through every student. It has to do with how they think, what kind of ideas they have and how they analyze the world they live in," Javadzadeh said.

From terrorism to sexuality, Javadzadeh enjoys focusing his time in his classes to teach students how to think differently.

He may not agree with everything in the texts required in his classes, or those in the outside world, but he offers students a real chance to think differently on the information presented in his classes.

"I like teaching sociology in particular because it gives me an opportunity to teach students to unlearn the obvious and think about the world as a social construct," Javadzadeh said. 

Before completing his bachelor's and master's degrees in sociology in 1995 and 1999, respectively, at Florida Atlantic University,  Javadzadeh had been in the field of engineering for 10 years. 

He earned a degree in construction management from FIU in 1990.

Yet, Javadzadeh said he left the engineering field to pursue sociology just like his father.

"I have always been interested in social interactions, political power, and social movements mostly due to the country I'm from, Iran, and also the influences of my father," Javadzadeh said.

"Instead of bedtime stories my dad read to me political theory and philosophy since I was 8 or 9 years old. He had the patience to answer all of my questions, and explain most intricate ideas."

After completing his master's degree, he was accepted into FIU to pursue his doctorate in sociology/anthropology.

"I think the highest form of art is to reduce the friction between what you love to do and what you do to make a living. I came to this realization a little too late. However, I am content with the change in my life," he said. 

He then began to teach classes as a teaching assistant in January 2000, and he completed his doctorate in 2006.

While he was a TA, Javadzadeh won the Best Teaching Assistant Award in the Art of Teaching.

"I think I am able to give students the tools to analyze the world beyond the mainstream and the status quo," Javadzadeh said.

"They can see life activities and social relationships in a different light. Through numerous conversations with students I have witnessed discontent with the way classes are taught. They feel that having to take notes, memorization and test taking does not encourage students to learn." 

By utilizing discussion as a tool, Javadzadeh is able to capture students in the class by giving them the opportunity to open their mind to different ideas. 

"In my classroom, they feel they have the power to bring in new ideas which minimizes the powerlessness students feel in regular class sessions," Javadzadeh said.

"I think I am compassionate about not only what I teach but also toward students, and that makes them feel at ease,," Javadzadeh said.

 This setting is a mechanism to get students to participate in class on many topics.  

They formulate several interpretations based on world around them and how it applies to life today.

"I am hoping my teaching styles have contributed to students wanting to learn and not lose the one important human quality, curiosity," Javadzadeh said. 

Junior Jillian Simms is a journalism student currently taking Javadzadeh's classical theory course. 

"It was a great decision to take to his class, it encourages students to think and apply it to life, which is something that many classes don't do," Simms said.

Headline: Women's volleyball sweeps past FAU, improves to 20-7
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Freshman outside hitter Yarimar Rosa wasn't too pleased with her team's performance after suffering a straight-set thumping to conference rivals Middle Tennessee State Oct. 29.

"Sometimes we play consistent and other times we are just so inconsistent and make a lot of errors," Rosa said. "We started off playing good and then they just made a rally of nine or ten points in a row and that made the big difference."

With the disappointment of that loss against the Blue Raiders still fresh in their minds, the Golden Panthers took out their frustration on the Florida Atlantic University Owls en route to a 3-0 (30-17, 30-27, 30-20) straight-set win at Pharmed Arena Nov. 3.

According to Golden Panthers head coach Danijela Tomic, it was a one-on-one conversation that she had with Rosa that may have made the difference.

"I felt that she performed below her potential against Middle Tennessee so I challenged her and the entire team to step up and she went out and had a great game against FAU," Tomic said.  "We played well and up to our potential and when we do that we are a very hard team to beat. It was a challenge for them to win the final games at home and it started with the win against FAU."

Ironically, the Owls were coming off an upset win over the Blue Raiders in their previous game, but even the wave of confidence built up from that win wasn't enough to drown the Golden Panthers.

Rosa led the Golden Panthers with a match-high 18 kills and eight digs on an impressive .433 hitting. Consistent contributor Arasay Guerra played her role once again with 11 kills and freshman Olga Vergun was deadly with 12 kills at a .500 clip and nine digs. Junior Andra Rasby had 13 digs and setter Keila Oliveira, who had a match-high 45 assists, now finds herself just 32 assists shy of the single season school record for assists with two matches left.

Leading the Owls in a dismal performance was Justine Perry with 11 kills and Casey Larocca who dished out 30 assists in the loss.

The performance delivered by the Golden Panthers was nothing short of dominant. Behind Rosa, the Golden Panthers finished the game at a .377 clip while holding the Owls to a woeful .084 hitting percentage, marking the fourth time all season that the Golden Panthers have held their opponent to under .100 in a match.

In every game, the Golden Panthers have asserted their dominance early on and it has proven to make the difference for them. In the first set they jumped out to a 4-0 lead and, although the deficit wasn't much, the Owls were never able to respond. The trend followed in the second and what turned out to be the final set as the Golden Panther got out to 10-3 and 8-3 leads, respectively.

With the win, the Golden Panthers improved to 20-7 on the year and 12-3 in Sun Belt Conference action - giving birth to the squad's first 20-win season since they won the Sun Belt title in 2001 and just the second time since the team began playing at the Division One level in 1987.

With the conference tourney rapidly approaching, the Golden Panthers will look to better their positioning and fine-tune their play in their final two games of the season this weekend.

Tomic says that as long as the team tightens up defensively, the possibilities are endless.

"We are taking every game like it is the most important game of the season. We have been working on blocking and floor defense in our recent practices and that has been our weakness. We should be a better blocking team than we are now," Tomic said. 

Troy will come in to Pharmed Arena Nov. 10 at 7 p.m. and Southern Alabama will look to upset the Golden Panthers Nov. 12 at 1 p.m.

Headline: FOR LOVE AND THE GAME: Quarterback Paul McCall balances more than classes and practices
Author: Magaly Estrella / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Besides trying to balance a job, social life, extracurricular activities and schoolwork, trying to make time for a relationship can be a challenge. 

But what if you are in a student-athlete committed relationship? 

Practicing football 20 hours a week, exercising twice a week in the morning, taking 15 credits a semester with classes in the morning and evening after football practice, traveling on Fridays, coming back home on Sundays, pledging for your fraternity and all while trying to make time for your girlfriend. 

Redshirt freshman quarterback Paul McCall knows this situation all too well.  

He has been dating his high school sweetheart, Ebe Mezzanotte, for three years.

"I really do love my girlfriend, but football is paying my way through school; without football I can't get an education," McCall said.

McCall and Mezzanotte met in sixth grade and lived close to one another. Soon after, their close friendship blossomed into a relationship.

Mezzanotte has known for years that football is her boyfriend's passion and supports him all the way.

"I am very proud of him. He has done great things ... getting a scholarship was a great opportunity for him, he deserves 100 percent of it. [Football] does take up a lot of his time but I know that it is something he loves to do and I am happy for him," she said. 

Now that McCall, a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, is close to graduating, he is taking some of the hardest courses for his degree in chemical engineering and, with football taking up most of his time during the season, it can get very stressful.

"You have so many things on your mind. You have to think about schoolwork, the fraternity; you have to think about football as much as possible and when you're not on the field you have to think about your girlfriend," he said. 

Although McCall says he has so many thoughts running through his head, he tries very hard not to take out his frustrations on Mezzanotte, especially after a bad game. 

"As much as I love football, it is only a game; you can't let a bad game affect the rest of your life," McCall said. "You have to play in seven days again [and] you can't think about a bad game from two weeks ago when you have another Sun Belt Conference game coming up."

Sometimes during the week, the couple gets together for breakfast before class or a short lunch between classes. Besides that, they don't get to see each other a lot during the week.

There are times when McCall is available for a couple of hours, but because of conflicting schedules, Mezzanotte is not. 

Mezzanotte, a sophomore majoring in criminal justice is in the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority. She says she too must balance a demanding agenda that sometimes gets in the way of seeing her boyfriend.  

However, she tries to attend all of his games and cheers for her boyfriend who can often be seen waving back and smiling at her. From the field.

When asked what the best part about dating McCall is, she giggled and said, "he is a great boyfriend, even though he doesn't have a lot of time, he makes a lot of time for me. He shows me that he cares about me all the time …  he is a very understanding person and I love him."

Come Sunday afternoon, McCall unwinds from his hectic schedule, spends some time with his girlfriend,  attends church and catches up on homework. 

"I really enjoy our Sunday afternoons; football is off your mind until Monday and the time we get to spend together is what I enjoy the most," he said. 

Although his schedule may become more hectic as the semester progresses, McCall believes everything he does is attainable as long as he prioritizes his responsibilities.

"[As long as you] get your priorities straight … you should be alright.  Some people say there are only 24 hours in a day, but that is a lot of time. Things that are important to you, you make time for them, like football, school and your girlfriend; God, family and your fraternity - you can make time for all those things; time management skills, priorities that's all there is."

FPL customers may get lower bills

Florida Power & Light went before regulators on Nov. 6 with mixed projections for costs to buy fuel for the state's power plants in 2007, a cost that is passed directly on to consumers.

FPL projects customers' bills will go down about $5 per month, largely because of a new, more efficient power plant the company plans to add on next year. 

FPL is also asking the Public Service Commission permission to reduce the hurricane surcharge customers are currently paying. If granted, the reduction would further lower monthly bills by about another 50 cents.

Meanwhile, other Florida utility companies are requesting the commission approve slight increases in fuel charges.

Workers find more bones near Ground Zero

According to authorities, workers found three bone fragments in a second manhole at the former World Trade Center site, now commonly called Ground Zero.

The remains were found near to where about 200 bones have already been recovered.

The bone pieces are one to two inches long and were discovered Nov. 4 along a road on the west part of the site.

Officials said they are going to continue to search 12 manholes and other underground areas along the road that they said were missed during the initial recovery of body parts after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Abortion clinics sue over records 

Two Kansas abortion clinics are requesting that the state Supreme Court investigate Attorney General Phill Kline and Fox television's Bill O'Reilly over O'Reilly's statements that he had obtained information from abortion records.

The clinics' attorneys want the court to retrieve records that Kline obtained on 90 of the clinics' patients. 

Kline was given edited versions of the records from a district judge because he argued that he wanted to review the records for evidence of possible crimes, such as rape and illegal abortions.

The attorneys asked the court to appoint a special prosecutor to determine whether O'Reilly's information came from the records turned over to Kline.

The clinics presented the lawsuit Nov. 6 - three days after O'Reilly said on his show that an inside source gave him information that a doctor at one of the clinics had performed late-term abortions because patients were depressed.

Kline is an outspoken abortion opponent.

Headline: Kimono workshop promotes cultural exchange
Author: Naihobe Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU alumna Aviva Menashe returned last year to Miami after three semesters of studying abroad in Japan. Among her souvenirs, she brought back a couple of kimonos. However, despite the long time she spent over there, she never learned how to wear them.

"I don't even know how to tie the obi [sash belt] correctly. There are websites online that tell you how to do it, but it's confusing," Menashe said.

Every year FIU students travel to Japan through FIU's study abroad program. 

On Nov. 13, internationally renowned kimono specialist Minoru Matsumoto will travel to FIU to show the art of kimono wearing to Menashe and other Japanese culture enthusiasts in a workshop entitled "The World of Kimono."

In the workshop, Matsumoto and his assistants will showcase kimonos from different periods and will teach attendees how to wear them. Some kimono styles to be showcased include that of a Samurai, a nobleman and a citizen from the Edo era. 

Miami is one of three stops for Matsumoto on his North American tour promoted by the Japan Foundation, an independent institution whose objective is to promote cultural exchange between Japan and overseas nations. Before coming to South Florida, Matsumoto held similar workshops in the Philippines, Turkey and Laos.

 "[Matsumoto] has great experience abroad and will be good for promoting cultural understanding here," said Satoru Yasuda, vice-consul of Japan in Miami.

The Japan Foundation was established in 1972 by special legislation. Today, its activities, including Matsumoto's visit to FIU, are funded by Japanese government subsidies, operation profits on government endowment, and donations from a private sector.

"Most of the consulate offices in America have long had a strong relationship with the surrounding universities," Yasuda said. 

The informal partnerships that exist between Japanese consulates and universities around the nation may explain how the next location for Matsumoto's workshop came to be the Graham Center Ballrooms.

From anime conventions to Japanese opera performances, the Consulate General of Japan in Miami and the FIU Institute for Asian Studies have a long history of collaboration.

"We work with [the consulate office] very closely …We then get them a location for the event and help them publicize it," said Steven Heine, director of the Institute for Asian Studies.

Publicity for the workshop has remained low-cost, relying mostly on e-mails and word of mouth, according to Japanese Consulate Spokeswoman Darci Kissinger.  

Organizers expect the event will bring different people with various interests together.

"There is a strong influence of Japanese culture everywhere - a lot of it [in] anime and manga, which is pop culture - but also [in] more traditional things like tea ceremonies, calligraphy, and even kimonos," Heine said.

"We want to bring a piece of Japan to people here in Florida," Kissinger said. 

The workshop will take place Nov. 13 at 10 a.m. in the Graham Center's East Ballroom. It is free of charge, but reservations are required by Nov. 10. For more information, e-mail the consulate at cjimia@cofs.net.

Headline: FIU raising $300,000 for charity
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Raising $300,000 in a little more than seven weeks does not seem an impossible goal for FIU's annual United Way campaign, which launched last month. Some events planned to reach the high goal include raffles with prizes such as iPODs and cameras, a silent auction and a tennis tournament. 

President Modesto A. Maidique said he is confident that FIU will surpass the goal, which was set $25,000 higher than last year's.

"This is an opportune time to give to those less fortunate and collectively, I know, we can make a significant difference to this endeavor," Maidique said in a press release. 

FIU's campaign is part of the national United Way campaign, a coalition of charitable organizations that join efforts in fundraising to help the children succeed and improve access to health care among other causes.

This year's FIU campaign is putting a heavy emphasis on its website, which has undergone major redevelopment and is the key point for donations. 

"We are emphasizing the use of technology to reach people. We worked very hard to make the website more user friendly," said Carmen Brown, assistant vice president of enrollment management, who is organizing the campaign.

Through the website anyone can make a donation in a variety of ways, including credit card and payroll deductions. The donations are not completely online however, and after filling out basic information such as name and address, the donor is given a form to fill out and mail to FIU. Donors can also designate which organizations they wish their donation to go to.

Everyone who donates online will have his or her name registered for a raffle. There have already been three raffles since the launch of the campaign and the next raffles will be Nov. 17 for an 80GB iPOD and Dec. 1 for a pair of South Beach Wine and Food Festival tickets, an incentive that Brown hopes will attract donations.

"We want people to understand how important it is to contribute to the community," Brown said. 

Individuals can donate directly to their favorite charities, but according to the FIU United Way website, donating through United Way actually increases the value of each donation through "matching gifts, gifts in kind, and volunteer time."

"Some matching funds can increase a donation by as much as three-to-one," according to the website.

Besides pure online donations, Brown said that there would likely be tables set up in the Graham Center to collect donations directly from students. 

There are also several events planned to raise funds including a silent auction that will run on the website from Dec. 4 through Dec. 15. Among the items that will be available for bid include gift baskets, gift certificates, and airline tickets.

"Everything is being donated," Brown said. 

Also, a tennis tournament to help raise funds will be held on Nov. 18 at the FIU Tennis Complex. The entry fee for students will be $15 and $35 for the general public, but those who participate will also have the option of donating more than the required entry fee. 

According to Brown, 100 percent of the profits will be put into the United Way fund.

However, fundraising won't be the only way FIU will be contributing to the United Way campaign. Brown said that FIU will also be organizing neighborhood clean up excursions to take volunteers to areas of the community that need to be cleaned up. 

The United Way campaign, which is being run by the office of admissions, ends Dec. 15.

Headline: Work study jobs available off-campus
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
As part of the federal work study program, freshman Alfredo Ball-Llovera found a job as a student assistant for the Campus Life department. He now earns $8 an hour and knows about many campus events.

"I looked at the job postings web site, and I found a position in this office that has helped me keep up-to-date on all campus life events," Ball-Lovera said. "It was a good deal."

The federal work study program - a need-based, federally funded financial aid program - is made up of 585 students working both on and off-campus. 

According to Adelfa Ukenye, assistant director of the financial aid office, the program's budget for the 2006-2007 school year is about $1.4 million.

For students interested in work study, the first step is filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, available starting each January.

The average amount awarded to undergraduates is $3,000 each academic year. However, one downfall of the program is that once a student has earned the semester allotment of $1,500 he or she can no longer work until the following semester when the other half of the allotment is made. 

Ukenye said that turning in the application by the annual March 1 priority deadline has a large effect on whether a student is awarded work study funding. 

"Funds usually deplete really fast because it goes to early applicants, by completion date, on a first-come, first-serve basis," she said.

After students have been approved and have accepted the award, they can choose whether to work on-campus or off-campus through the job listings website, http://w3.fiu.edu/workstudy/JobList/fall.html. 

Students who choose to work off-campus can either be tutors in local public schools as part of the America Reads program or they can be a part of a nonprofit community organization such as the Young Men's Christian Association, according to Angel Garcia, former senior enrollment officer of the financial aid office.

Students are paid based on academic level: $8 per hour for freshmen and sophomores and $9 per hour for juniors and seniors.

Some students, such as sophomore Shane Phen, think the wages are unfair. 

"I don't think it's fair that certain students are being paid $8 or $9 just because they are work study," he said. "I have friends working at the bookstore who work just as hard but are paid lower wages."

Garcia, however, believes that the wages aid the students who need the financial help - the students for whom the program was implemented.

"Is it fair? No, but it really helps out the students who are in need of financial assistance," Garcia said. 

Barbara Douglas, manager of the multicultural programs and services office, said that it is beneficial for departments to hire more work study students.

"Work study students' paychecks are federally funded, so they don't come out of the office's budget," she said. "However, we can't hire all work study students because the financial aid office determines how many we can get. We request a certain number, but it's ultimately up to them."

Departments' requests are also approved on a first-come, first-serve basis, according to Ukenye.

Many departments can hire no more than two work study students, with some exceptions.

"Bigger departments have more students than others," she said. "You can't go to the library and cap them at two. They're huge."

According to Garcia, the work-study program doesn't limit the number of available jobs.

"I think it's creating more jobs, actually," Garcia said. "Because work study students are federally supported, departments have more money to hire students and open up more jobs."

Ukenye asserts that work study students do not receive special treatment.

"Work study students are not special," Ukenye said. "They are employees of the University, so they can be terminated just like anyone else."
