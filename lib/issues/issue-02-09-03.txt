Both the men's and women's teams fell in their season openers on the road. Both teams faced tough opponents.

The men's soccer team fell short Friday in its first match of the season to the Titans of Cal State Fullerton, 3-2. 

Titan forward Hector Orellana wasted no time, scoring the first goal of the game only after one minute into the contest. 

Lucas Scudeler assisted defender Allen Handy who scuffled past the Fullerton defense and goalkeeper Sam Reynolds for the first FIU goal of the afternoon. 

Zachary Peoples scored from 18 yards out in the 73rd minute. 

Orellana scored once again off a blocked penalty kick, which tied the game. 

With the game tied at two, Adriano Lima made his way past the FIU keeper Roy Rosenberg, scoring the goal that would prove to be the deciding score in the 83rd minute.  

FIU faces St. John's in Jamaica, NY  on Friday.

Women's Soccer falls to Western Carolina 3-1

FIU's women's soccer team played their first game of the season at the Mariott-Radison Kick-Off Classic in Boca Raton, Fla.  

Western Carolina defeated the Golden Panthers 3-1 Friday afternoon. Forward Natasha Moore of WCU  proved to be unstoppable by the Golden Panthers as she recorded a hat trick, scoring three goals.  

A play set up by Midfielder Nicola Bell allowed Midfielder Janessa Taddei to score for FIU's only goal.  

The Golden Panthers' play the team's second game against Memphis in the Classic Sunday, Sept. 1 at noon.

Headline: Every element in place for inaugural football game
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
When FIU was first granted permission by the now defunct Florida Board of Regents to begin a football program, their slogan was "Congratulations, we got it !" On opening night, the team had it.

It had the support of a sea of blue and gold spectators which were 17,314 strong despite the listing for capacity at the stadium is 16,751.

It had the marching band, La Banda Del Sol, performing to the delight of the standing room only crowd.

It had the exposure, as the game was carried by Sunshine Network and seen statewide. The results were also mentioned in ESPN's Sportscenter.

It had the celebrities. Former Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino, Florida Marlins third baseman and FIU alumnus Mike Lowell and Governor Jeb Bush were on hand for the ceremonial coin toss.

But most importantly, they had a team and a place to call home.

The program was  originally set to be launched in 2001. Instead, the school pushed back the date to better accomodate specific needs such as a fieldhouse, turf, and the necessary expansion of the Tamiami Stadium.

"On Sept. 9, 1999, I was the only guy here," an emotional Don Strock said to the media at the conclusion of the game. "We got coaches, recruited players, and built a team. I promised [the players] if they came we'd build them a stadium. It was like Field of Dreams - we built it and they came."

But this game provided more than a thorough beating of an overmatched St. Peters team. It was the beginning of change.

The UP campus had the feel of a true college atmosphere instead of the commuter feeling we all have grown accustomed to. 

For the first time ever, the two campuses came together even if it might have been for one night only. The 25 miles that separate the UP and Biscayne Bay campus seemed like a much shorter distance on Thursday night as BBC students were brought down to the game.

Students tailgated prior to the contest and partied at its conclusion. The celebration carried on to a congested Gracie's Grill in the Graham Center. This was a definite contrast to the apathy displayed for FIU athletics.

At 2 a.m. as I was leaving campus, I saw resident students walking back to their homes still sporting FIU paraphanelia and for once, it wasn't University of Miami clothing. The evening gave a new meaning to campus life and school spirit.

The football players, who once made headlines for attacking an alumni basketball player, were now the love of the university. As the final seconds ticked off the clock the players ran to the student section to greet their loyal supporters who were present throughout the evening.

But the question that needs answering now is "Will they come back ?"

"I hope it stays like this for a while," university President Modesto "Mitch" Maidique said as he ran around the field waiving at those in attendance. 
"We are the 14th-largest university in the country. One of the powerhouses of American universities. There is nothing else that pulls in so many different friends and elements of the community [like football]."

Now that the first game is done, will the Golden Panthers see such support again? Will the students, faculty, fans, and alumni return for the second, third, and fourth home games?

Will all the painted faces be there again ? Will the football players see such support this season, or ever again? Or was this just a one-time occurence? It's all up to the FIU community to make that happen. 	

It's up to the administration to continue to market the team to the community around the university. 

It's up to alumni's to come back to campus. Their presence will only strengthen the school's ties to its graduates and open the doors to potential donors. 

It's up to the student organizations like Panther Rage and student government not to let the support for the team to fizzle out after one strong night.

But even if all this was just for one night, FIU, the school, the football program, and the students, had it.

Headline: Three teams sweep Golden Panthers at season opener
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU was defeated in all three of its matches to open the 2002 season.  

The Golden Panthers lost the team's season opener to the Guachos of UC-Santa Barbara, 19-30, 19-30, 20-30, at the Ramada Invitational in San Diego, Calif.

Junior Adriana Fundora tied the game-high with 14 kills and also led the Golden Panthers with nine digs. Nirvana Kos and Jennifer Owens each recorded nine kills. Elizabeth Baldwin had a team-high 17 assists.

Danielle Bauer led the Gaucho attack with 14 kills. She also recorded a double-double, digging 10 balls.

The Golden Panthers fell  in three games (15-30, 29-31, 29-31) to San Diego State in the team's afternoon matchup at the Ramada Invitation Tournament in San Diego, Calif. The nightcap was no better for the Golden Panthers, as Tulane won a close match, 2-3 (33-31, 25-30, 30-24, 30-32, 13-15).

Owens led all players with 14 kills on the day. Senior Kos added 13 of her own. 

San Diego State had five straight points and took an 11-6 lead in the early going against the Golden Panthers. FIU never got closer than four after that time. Eleven unforced errors also helped the Aztecs. SDSU hit .524 compared to -.143 for the Golden Panthers.

FIU came back to hold a 27-22 advantage late in the contest. However, two kills apiece from Aspen McPartland and Melissa Cansdale tied the match at 27. The Aztecs won six straight points with Zlatina Anguelova providing the game-winning kill to give her team the 31-29 win. Owens (5) and Kos (4) led FIU in kills in that game.

The final game was another tightly contested affair. Neither team lead by more than two points. The score was tied at 29, when SDSU closed out the match on an FIU service error and a kill by Robyn Gregg.

In the nightcap, FIU took a 5-1 lead in game one. It was shortlived as Tulane battled back. FIU still held the lead at 14-13. The Green Wave would increase its lead to as many as three at 27-24, but the Golden Panthers battled back to tie it up at 29. FIU then put the game away, 33-31 for the win. 

The Golden Panthers battled to a tie on nine occasions. The Green Wave won the game 30-25.

Game three was a contest of runs as Tulane jumped out to a 10-5 lead before the FIU battled back to tie the game at 14. Both teams battled through five additional ties. But with the score tied at 18, the Golden Panthers outscored the Green Wave 12-6 the rest of the way for a 30-24 win. 

With the score knotted at six, FIU distanced themselves from Tulane. It held a 17-14 lead midway through the period. Tulane didn't give up.

They fought back to tie the score at 17-all and held off a Golden Panther match point at 29-28 to tie the score at 29. After failing to convert with a 30-29 lead, Tulane was able to capitalize one opportunity later to take the game 32-30. 

The Green Wave was able to take advantage of several FIU mistakes as three-straight Golden Panther errors provided Tulane with a 10-8 lead midway through the period. The Golden Panthers would cut the lead to one at 12-11 and 13-12 before eventually knotting the score at 13.

After a timeout, Tulane regrouped and got a cross-court kill. When that was combined with a key block by Swafford and junior opposite hitter Nitia Small the Green Wave sealed the victory. 

Nirvana Kos and junior Adriana Fundora each had 23 kills to lead the Golden Panthers. Jennifer Owens tallied 18. Defensively, Fundora recorded 15 digs, her first double-double of the year, while senior Vanessa Gonzalez-Vinas had 12 of her own. 

The Golden Panthers travel again next weekend to the Xavier Tournament. FIU will play Xavier, Tennessee Tech and Texas-Pan American in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Headline: Kremser begins rebuilding process
Subheadline: Men's soccer coach enters 23rd season at helm
Author: Daniel Martin/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There are two ex-Dolphins who coach at FIU. One was a quarterback, and the other was a kicker. One is head football coach Don Strock. The other is long-time men's head soccer coach Karl Kremser.

Kremser led the 1969 Dolphins in scoring before an injury the next summer cut his NFL career short.

Kremser doesn't talk about his experience in football very much according to Mid-Fielder Juan Rivera.

Karl Kremser, born in West Germany, played collegiate soccer for the U.S. Military Academy in West Point before transferring to the University of Tennessee. Tennessee didn't have a soccer team, so Kremser joined the football team as their kicker. Kremser graduated from Tennessee in 1969.

After a season with the Dolphins, Kremser worked out for the Green Bay Packers. At the same time, Kremser was a physical education teacher in Hialeah. During this time Kremser found he liked coaching, and after he was done with football, he took over as the head soccer coach at Killian high school &#8211; winning a state championship.

In 1977, Kremser began coaching college at Davidson, and improved from 0-16 that year, to 8-13 in 1979. Then, in 1980, Kremser took the helm at FIU.

In 1982, Kremser coached the soccer team to the NCAA Division II National Championship game in front of a home crowd &#8211; and they won. The National Championship was FIU's first in any sport. By 1986, Kremser had built the program to Division I prominence. Since that time, the team has won at least 10 games in every year but three. 

FIU doesn't just simply beat cupcake teams, every year Kremser and his staff of coaches try and play the toughest schedule possible.

"We look at a schedule not by how many games we're going to win; we want to play the best teams. We look for very strong competition. It's the only way you can rank yourself, and that helps come tournament time because we're used to (the strong competition)," Kremser said.

As Kremser enters his 23rd season as head coach at FIU, he still seeks a NCAA Division I National Title.

"We're probably still a year away," Kremser said.

Last year, the Golden Panthers lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament. This year their goals are higher. This year, the team's conference winner gets an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Last year, that wasn't the case in the Atlantic Soccer Conference. The Golden Panthers were selected as an at large team. 

"We want to win the conference, because that opens the door to a lot of other things. Once we're there, [we want to] get through a couple of rounds," Kremser said.

Kremser has had his team on the verge of a Division I championship before. In 1996, the team played for the National Championship but lost. Then the next year they began the year ranked No. 1 in the nation, according to the National Coaches Association of America.

In Kremser's 22 years at FIU, his record is 272-138-33. He was the state Coach of the Year in 1980, and in 1985, he was named Collegiate Coaches' South Region Coach of the year. Also, in 1991 and 1996, Trans America Athletic Conference named him Coach of the Year.

Kremser's coaching style is tough. He's all business according to a couple of his senior players.

"He's the type (of coach that) you see what you get. He expects a lot and it shows when we play," said senior Forward Matias Asorey. "He's always pushing."

"He has a reputation of being a tough guy. He is not a buddy, buddy coach," said Juan Rivera. "He's a strict coach. If you're on his good side, everything is good, but if you get on his bad side it's hard."

"He's very demanding when it comes to speed and quickness. The college game is very physical. If you're not ready, you're not going to succeed. He's helped me progress physically when other coaches would never stress that with me," said Asorey.

Headline: Football brings out school spirit as few other things can
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
It's really easy to be cynical.  As a member of the press, I find it's even easier.  We question things, analyze them and write about them: it's what we do.  So I'll admit that going into last Thursday's first-ever FIU football game, I was very cynical.  

Granted, as a fan of the sport in general, I had hoped our team would do well, eventually. Throughout the summer, however, I heard several things that shook my confidence. For one thing, FIU, a first year team expected to struggle, would face the supposed powerhouses of their division &#8211; St. Peter's College &#8211; a team that lost a mere one game last season.  With those odds, FIU seemed like the clear underdogs.  

As I sat in the stands last Thursday  about an hour before the game, I thought that, sadly, the fans might not pack the stadium, that their confidence might have been rattled as well. After all it's FIU, a school not exactly known for its students' school spirit. 

Last Thursday, however, was a night of surprises.

First, there was the fact that FIU didn't just win, but nearly shutout its opponent, holding them to a mere three points.  

But the greatest surprise, was the fans. A few minutes before the game started, I saw a mass of people flood the stadium, packing the seats and showing their support in a way I never thought was possible. Just like that &#8211;from one day to the next FIU students went from showing very little support to coming out in blue and gold face paint and every FIU T-shirt imaginable.  

I realized, as I heard students chanting this school's name that I had never heard the phrase "FIU" shouted in such a proud manner.  It sounded so strange, I couldn't really bring myself to do it, merely because I simply wasn't used to this display of FIU school spirit. 

I realized that as much as I don't want to admit it, football might actually be a good thing for this school, few things can bring students together in such a way. 

As far as academics are concerned, FIU has been trying to build a name for itself, and yet many students still don't seem very supportive. 

I recently had a conversation with a friend, who spoke very highly of his professors and of all their advanced degrees from prestigious universities and finished every sentence with, "why she is teaching at FIU is a mystery." I wondered what it would take for a student like him to start thinking of that as a sign that this university might be something to be proud of.  

As sad as it may seem, football might be the answer. On the outset, academics and football may not seem related, but on some weird level our society has linked them. Outside of Ivy League schools, many schools get their name out through football while still remaining loyal to academics.  

As far as I'm concerned, as long as academics remain a priority, I couldn't care less how the school manages to make students proud to attend this university.  The show of support I saw on Thursday was a rare and welcomed sight. If football can elicit this kind of response, then keep it coming.

Headline: Middle-Eastern conflict should not result in campus censorship
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
By Onkar Ghate
Knight Ridder Tribune

The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, according to many college professors, have claimed another victim: free speech on campus. They contend that a chilling climate has arisen, in which they hesitate to voice ideas critical of America for fear of reprimand by university officials.

At the University of Texas, for instance, when the administration criticized a professor for accusing America of terrorism, his colleague described the faculty's reaction: "There was a very clear message that if you stick your neck out, (the administration) will disown you." 

Blaming a nationwide climate, the general secretary of the American Association of University Professors said a "distrust of intellectuals has always lurked beneath the surface of American popular opinion. Now it has begun to leak out again." AAUP's director of public policy claims there "are some things here that harken back to McCarthyism."

We must, the professors insist, return to the day when a professor could express any view, no matter how unpopular.

In reality, however, the professors are concerned not with defending free speech – but with retaining control over the universities.

Freedom of speech is an individual's right to express ideas without coercive interference from the government. Free speech does protect an individual who voices unpopular ideas, but it does not require that others support him. If an individual wants others to finance the expression of his ideas, he must seek their voluntary agreement. To force another person to support ideas he opposes violates his freedom of speech.

A journalist, for instance, has the freedom to write what he pleases but has no right to demand that Time magazine publish it. That decision belongs to the head of Time. Similarly, a professor has the freedom to teach any view he wishes but has no right to demand that Harvard employ him. That decision belongs to the head (or governing body) of Harvard. Freedom of speech is not the right of a Ph.D. to have others provide him with a university classroom.

Yet that is precisely what these professors are demanding.

They maintain that no matter how much the trustees of a university disagree with a professor's views, they should not be able to fire him. The owners of a university are to be stripped of their right to choose which ideas their wealth supports. Why? So that professors who consistently teach the evil of individualism, capitalism, the profit motive – and America – can espouse their views without the burden of having to seek the voluntary consent of those forced to sponsor them.

Under the guise of championing free speech, therefore, these leftist professors are actually demanding its destruction (which is consistent with their advocacy of speech codes and "sensitivity training" on campuses). What makes them think they can get away with this?

Most universities today are public institutions. Critics of the academic left have been calling for the firing of professors who broadcast anti-American ideas, since such views are odious to most taxpayers. But subjecting speech to majority rule, the left correctly argues, obliterates freedom of speech. Thus, it concludes, we must leave college professors alone.

This is a false conclusion. The truth is that public education as such is antithetical to free speech. Whether leftists are forced to pay taxes to fund universities from which their academic spokesmen are barred, or non-leftists are forced to pay taxes to fund professors who condemn America as a terrorist nation, someone loses the right to choose which ideas his money supports.

To protect free speech, therefore, universities would have to be privatized. The owners of a university could then hire the faculty they endorsed, while others could refuse to fund the university if they disagreed with its teachings. But since privatization would threaten the left's grip on the universities, it vehemently opposes this solution. In the name of free speech, the left denounces as "tyranny of the almighty dollar" the sole means of actually preserving free speech.

So we must not be fooled by the professors' cries about threats to their freedom of speech. Freedom is precisely what they don't want. Their grumblings are simply smokescreens to prevent us from seeing that we are right in objecting to being forced to finance their loathsome ideas.

Headline: Reality of growing up elicits fear of unknown
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
Whoever said time flies when you're just having fun?  As I begin this semester I'm realizing how untrue that is. Time only flies in hindsight. When I look back at all I've done over my past 20 years of life I can barely wrap my brain around it. Where did it all go?

Juniors and seniors know what I'm talking about, right? The worries now aren't "What college am I getting into," or "What's my GPA?" No, we have reached a fork in the road. The place where two paths diverge, as Robert Frost so eloquently put it. Now the million-dollar question is what are you going to do?

Sorry to spoil your fun freshmen. Though this is your first semester in college, I'm sure you have your own version of this syndrome. Yes, you are all worried about what to major in, what classes to take and what to do with the rest of your lives. Granted, the world seems big but hey you've got time right? 

So life in all its complexity boils down to this: the unknown. Seniors, wouldn't you like to know what job to take? Freshmen, wouldn't you like to know what to reach for? In the end this uncertainty is what binds us together as college students. 

Aside from being poor and eating three day old pizza, we're growing up. Yes, those words you hated to hear as a child and teenager once again plague you, but this time it's for real.

Along the course of these four years most of you will wake up one day and realize you've become an adult. 

This means if you try to scam Columbia House or BMG it will show up on your credit record. You will look back on everything before that day of enlightenment and say, "What the heck?" You will say this because there is nothing else to say. 

You can't explain what your life means. And when you try and put it into words your mouth sounds like it's been anesthetized because your slur of words doesn't make any sense.

Yes, this sucks. Caught between knowing and not knowing and just when you've got the puzzle figured out,  someone knocks it over and you have to start from scratch. A rather nihilistic view, isn't it? Not necessarily.

If you are scared of the unknown and fear the future, college will be the worst time of your life, and moving on once you graduate will be difficult. 

Worry about how to get where you're going and not where you're going. Destinations change but the way you get to them always remains the same. Freshmen, take some time to relax and explore other options. If you're a biology major, take an architecture course. Seniors, if you're an engineering major find a job in the field and see if you really like it.

Right now we are in a bubble of hopes and dreams. If you look to your parents and older friends and family you can see the real world is not as easy. Once you're out of here, it takes a lot more work to get where you want to go.

Stop reading so much. Stop partying every night. Stop studying. Stop everything for a moment and mull it over. Think about things and sort them out, whatever they may be. 

That's my advice to us college students. Take some time to look at everything you are and everything you've done and everything you want to be. 

Once you do that, then go ahead and raise a pint to yourself, the good times are yet to come.

FIU football: We don't know how it happened, and we're not going to question it.  Congratulations on winning your first game.  We can only hope this trend will continue as the season goes on.

Gamma Lamda Mu: Good luck on getting your fraternity off the ground.  It shows our school has come a long way. Hopefully, this will make the campus more diverse and pave the way for other groups with similar intentions.  

Signs: With movies like "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as your competition, it's no wonder you've been No. 1 for five straight weeks – or maybe people just got sick of watching Jennifer Aniston prove something to herself, either way M. Night Shyamalan's happy.

Losers

St. Peter's College:  So what happened to your No. 1 defense on Thursday?  We were expecting some actual competition.  A flock of actual peacocks might have fared better than you guys. 

Grammar test fees:   Are we really so strapped for cash that FIU needs to charge its students a $15 fee for a required grammar test?  Well you know what? Us dont need for to be taken no grammer testing.

FIU Sports: Despite the football team's win, volleyball and both men's and women's soccer began their new seasons with embarrassing starts, all losing. If your teams ever want to get out of the shadow of the football team, our best advice is to start winning. Like, immediately.

Headline: Letter to the Editor:  UNC assignment not necessarily balanced educational endeavor
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I am sorely disappointed that you would choose to publish, in the August 28th edition of The Beacon, the article entitled, "Students, parents should embrace exposure to new ideas."

This piece by Linda P. Cambell of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram is so obviously biased and uninformed as to be "pontificating" itself. 

The author speaks of the challenge by the American Center for Law and Justice to a University of North Carolina summer reading requirement for incoming freshmen. This assignment is a book, "Approaching the Koran: The Early Revelations".  

She insinuates that opposition to this assignment is closed-minded and goes on to say, "There's nothing blissful about ignorance – and it's foolish to impede the pursuit of knowledge."  

Maybe the author should pursue a little knowledge herself.  

Certainly, while the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people, the Koran itself instructs followers of Islam to kill those who won't convert and "do not befriend the Jews and the Christians, for they are friends of each other."  

I point you to Suura 9:5 and 5:51.  Don't forget that 19 of 19 hijackers on Sept. 11 were Muslims.  Look at what Islamist fanaticism is doing all over the globe.  

The problem with the assignment at UNC is that it does not present a balanced view of the Koran, only showing the favorable side, if there is one, to Islam.  

Can you imagine how quickly the ACLU would act if a pro-Christian book were required reading? 

We can't even have the Ten Commandments in public institutions anymore. This, while students in a California public school district were recently required to adopt a Muslim name and wage their own Jihad.

Is anyone awake?

In the future, I hope that The Beacon chooses more balanced articles to print in its pages.  Because the ideas expressed by Ms. Campbell, were, as she put it, "repugnant, confounding, even outlandish."

Headline: In Our View:  Gay fraternity would make homosexuality more visible on campus
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
In a city like Miami, it's often easy for us to take for granted the need for diversity on our FIU campuses. It's easy for us to assume things are already as diverse and accepting as possible. 

The truth of the matter is that FIU isn't exactly as diverse as it could be.  

One of the main things missing from our university is a major vocal gay and lesbian presence on campus.  

Although FIU does have an organization dedicated to gay and lesbians, Stonewall Student Union, few things can bring issues to light as a fraternity can. 

If you've ever passed through GC at various part of the semester, you've probably noticed what a large and visible presence fraternities are on this campus, which is why the creation of an eventual gay fraternity at FIU is an important addition to our campus atmosphere. 

This semester, a group known as Gamma Lamda Mu, an organization that caters to gay males, is set to begin, hopeful that one day their group might become a fraternity here at FIU.  

Initially, the obvious reservation one might have concerning a gay fraternity is that it sounds somewhat discriminatory.  

Many will argue that existing fraternities don't discriminate on the basis of sexuality, thus, negating the need for a specifically gay fraternity on campus.  However, the organization has made it clear that although they cater to gay males, they are not discriminatory and will accept heterosexual members, provided they are gay-friendly.

The main necessity for the gay fraternity, if it does become a reality in the future, is to give gay men a chance to connect with other gay men and/or gay-friendly males on campus in a manner that is not political, but purely based on brotherhood.

It may seem as though we don't need to bring the issue to light any further, but the fact of the matter is that we do, and we must never stop trying until cases like Mathew Shepard become obsolete.  The main way to ensure this happens is to avoid keeping it a "quiet" aspect of society.

Thus, in the long-run, the organization would make a very important impact on the university at large.  

Although Stonewall is and will continue to be a great service to gay and lesbians students, fraternities are, if nothing else,  visible; having a gay fraternity on campus will bring homosexuality to light and make it a very notable aspect of our campus in a way few other things can.

Headline: Olivares, 24, dies from muscular dystrophy complications
Author: Marlynne Boyer / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Journalism graduate student Miguel Olivares died last week of Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy  at the age of 24. 

 Olivares' parents left lucrative jobs in Colombia to move to Miami so their son could attend  journalism classes at Florida International University.  

"He was a pretty courageous young man," Journalism and Broadcasting Department Chair Michael McQueen said. "He had a dream of coming here to be a journalist and his parents left Colombia for him to fulfill his dream because he felt he could not accomplish it in Colombia.  He was very positive.  I really almost forgot that he had a disability.  He was a heck of a good student." 

McQueen was not the only one to have good things to say about Miguel.

"He was very kind, – very dedicated to his studies." Disability Services Office manager Alex Jean-Joseph said. "He definitely didn't let his disability hinder his academic performance." 

DMD is a genetic disease that weakens the voluntary muscles in males.  It is rare for those who suffer with DMD to live past their late twenties. Miguel's brother also died from this disease years earlier.

Miguel was on the way to fulfilling his dream to be a journalist.  He interned at CNN, wrote for a newspaper called El Imigrante, and currently worked for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. 

 McQueen is holding a memorial service for Miguel Olivares on Sept. 9 at 4 p.m. at the Student Resource Center at the Biscayne Bay Campus.

Headline: Football game helps students feel school spirit
Author: Christina Kent / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After five years of waiting, FIU played it's inaugural football game against St. Peter's College of New Jersey Thursday night.

"From freshman to seniors, faculty to alumni, you can feel the energy and the pride of wearing gold and blue now in South Florida," sophomore and public relations major Heredes Ribeiro said hours before the game.

Others concentrated on selling football-related merchandise on the inaugural day. Marisa Rodriguez, senior accountant for the Activities and Business Services Office, sold t-shirts for $5 and ponchos for $1 for the university in the Graham Center. 

"We're not even making a profit off these t-shirts, we're breaking even," she said. "[They were just made in bulk] for the event."

An estimated $15,000 worth of t-shirts were sold.

Major Dave Mount, a first year Military Science and Leadership professor and graduate student, purchased both items at Rodriguez's stand.

"I'll definitely go to all the games to support FIU. I'm a big sports fanatic and I attend almost every game for this school," Mount said. "I think this will put FIU on equal footing now with some other universities that have football teams."

Mount planned to change out of his army fatigues and go FIU-clad for the big game.

Fans and students enjoyed the daytime activities scattered throughout the day and many picked up freebies like raffle tickets, t-shirts, pizza, a BBQ lunch and other club-sponsored giveaways. The press even wanted to know what all the commotion was about.

"NBC 6 just came by and started interviewing people," said Promotions Director for WRGP Radiate 88.1 FM Ayxa Barbel, who had been in Panther Square all day.  

Lorraine Quintana, senior and social work major, couldn't attend the game. She and others had to work at the Panther Stop convenience store and bookstore most of the day.

"It's busier than usual because not only is it the first week of classes, but many people are here for the game buying snacks and drinks. We don't get off until 11 tonight," Quintana said.

Not everyone had a pleasant experience at the game itself Thursday night.

Maurice Tricarico and his wife, parents of a daughter in the marching band, were waiting with their two young sons at one of the gates. 

"They could have learned from other local colleges how to set up a game entrance. This is hazardous and ridiculous," Tricarico said angrily among other pushing, sweating bodies. "This is the first and last time I attend an FIU football game."

"It's unbelievable and this is dangerous for my children," Tricarico's wife, Kim, said.

Once up in the stands, one could notice thousands of people (an estimated 17,000) clothed in gold, blue and the gray "FIU Football" shirts, stomping their feet and doing the crowd-contagious "wave" around the stadium. The designated fight chant, "Pluck those Peacocks," became the phrase of the night.

"The day has been going smoothly," Barbel said at around 3 p.m. &#8211; four hours before the start of the game &#8211; when skies were looking gray. "I think everyone is excited but also a little worried about the weather."

Headline: Adventures in Dining
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Like all typical college students, I think that academia comes in a paltry second behind that all-power craving known as "hunger." And I'm not talking about a sudden urge of the munchies. I mean hard-core, wearing-your-teeth-down-on-the-bones-of-dead-animal-carcass food consumption. I've been known to pack in the pounds of pizza and I almost always super-size. Oh, who am I kidding? I always super-size.

So I consider myself a bit of a gourmet conoisseur. I know the how-tos and the what-nots of eating on campus. For example, the coffee out of those cheapo little machines right out of "Carmen Sandiego" with the little drop-down cups is surprisingly good. I wouldn't recommend it on a daily basis or anything like that, but when you're rushing to class and you need a little caffeine kick, you can't go wrong.

This year, our proud little university threw me and my tummy a curve-ball. Gone are Pan-Geos and Burger King. In their place, an all new eatery. An all-you-can eat eatery, if you will. Being the little glutton I am, I decided to investigate.

The new eatery is located where the old one was, although you  actually have to  enter through the stinky side hall to the lockers to get in. They've painted it up with pretty food wallpaper, but they can never make me forget the stench that once emanated from that strange little hallway. 

My ragtag posse consisted of two friends and myself. The first discovery our little expedition made was that you must pay to enter the cafeteria. You can't even hang out with your buddies while they eat unless you pay the entrance fee. Very uncool. I noticed a lot of large groups turning around specifically because their buddies could not tag along. However, this did not faze us, for we all came with appetites and moolah. And besides, at least they offered us a printed menu next to the cashier, where we made discovery number two.

"Horno Pork." Yes, you read right. Apparently, they had been serving something called "Horno Pork" earlier that day. For there it was on the menu, in all its glory. You know the chef who named that masterpiece was either a college student or a big "Monty Python" fan. Unfortunately, this was not what was being served for our expedition. Perhaps another time, "Horno Pork."

I fear the cashier system. When we went, we were the only ones in line. But on busy lunch days, there could be large crowds trying to get in and only two cashier's slowly taking everyone's money. One good bum-rush by a hungry crowd and the whole system could go to pot. The food system is rather unorganized too. Once you're in, you find a tray cart, grab a tray and utensils and kind of linger around the kitchen areas looking at the pretty displays while searching for the area without glass sneeze-guard paneling. 

Then, you stand around until the chefs acknowledge you and make your food. It's a rather trying system and if a big group forms, it could become rather chaotic. They could at least form little queues in front of each kitchen.

Let's get on to the food itself. It is very touch-and-go. Meaning, I touch it and then I want to go. Just kidding. What I actually mean is that the food is marginally good sometimes and marginally bad other times. The best meal was some sort of fried fish and veggies from Island Cuisine. Mixed with white rice, it was actually quite enjoyable on the palate. Nothing outstanding, but definitely worthy of a second round (and isn't that what all-you-can eat is about?) Also decent was some rotisserie chicken at American Kitchen (though the ten minute wait was a bit trying).

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the yellow rice and cucumber stuff on top. It managed to have both no taste and a bad taste. It made me yearn for the nifty little rice menagerie I had been munching on earlier. 

Also quite bad was the American Bistro steak wrap. Considering the cooks had just put the wraps out, we expected them to at least be, well, warm. Instead, they tasted like old lettuce, old pita and dry steak fresh out of the refrigerator. The soup that was included was downable, but just barely. Add to this that the paper it was wrapped in was also wrapped into the pita so that I had to unroll the whole thing to get the paper out and you can say I was left feeling very unimpressed by American Bistro.

Mediterranean Kitchen fared better. The pasta was actually pasta. None of that six-cent ramen noodle garbage. I'm not much of a pasta guy so I didn't really dive much into it, but my friends gave it a thumbs up so you'll have to take their word on it. 

I was too busy griping about the fact that of the four eateries available, two used the word "kitchen" in the name. Come on, folks. You got Cuisine and Bistro. Are you telling me you couldn't think up something else?  Eatery would make a great word. Mediterranean Eatery. Or how about Mediterranean Cookery?

Three complaints: One, the cups are way too small. I had to get up every five seconds to get myself a refill. It's already all-you-can eat. At least pony up with some decent size cups. Two, dessert is needed. Good dessert. Like a soft-serve ice cream dispenser. There was some weird peach pastry at the American Kitchen that made me and my friends gag. The fruit filling was cold and the actual pastry itself was under-cooked to extremely gooey levels. I'm talking borderline salmonella case here. And the flan/pudding/mushy, cold French Toast thing over at Island Cuisine was definitely no better. Third, the place needs entertainment. Like a karaoke stage where you can boo some hapless English major who thought it'd be cool to sing "Jenny (867-5309)" after downing a plate of pasta and nine glasses of iced tea. Some people are going to end up eating alone. Give them some form of amusement.

So what are my final thoughts on this new establishment on our campus? It's not bad. A little steep at $6.50 for a dinner, but if you come bearing a hearty appetite and you make the right choices, you can't go wrong. Much like those "Choose your path" books, some choices will lead to death, but thanks to that all-you-can eat system, you can always flip back to the first page and try again.

Headline: "Serving Sara" pairs celebrities, lacks chemistry
Author: Heather Brummer
&nbsp;
In Hollywood, if you can slap two fairly attractive people together onscreen, you've got yourself a movie. There are no further rules; attractive people, all by themselves, can carry a film otherwise devoid of humor, originality or even a plot. 

"Serving Sara" does not necessarily meet the above description. It does not entirely lack humor, originality or a plot. There are a few precious moments when the unsuspecting moviegoer may let out a chuckle. There is a bit of originality in the arrangement of the characters. And yes, if you concentrate long enough, you might even find a plot somewhere in this film. But it won't be easy. 

The two attractive people are Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley. Perry is known to most of us as the kind (and often thoughtless) Chandler Bing on NBC's "Friends." Hurley, on the other hand, is probably best recognized from her modeling days as Estee Lauder's main spokesperson. Oh yeah, and there was also that little stint on "Austin Powers." 

With that in mind, here is a breakdown of the rest of the film: Matthew Perry stars as Joe Tyler, New York's hottest process server, a technical term which means his job is to serve people legal paperwork, such as subpoenas and divorce notices.  

Elizabeth Hurley is Sara Moore, a woman who has her stake in more cash than most of us can count. They are brought together when Hurley's mean-spirited husband Gordon (Bruce Campbell) hires Joe to serve Sara with divorce papers, which will eradicate her share of the fortune. 

The catch comes in when Joe arrives to serve Sara and she counters his offering with her own, which would involve him serving papers to Gordon instead. As it happens, if Sara is served her paperwork in Texas, she loses the money. If Gordon is served in New York, they split it.

When Joe receives a $1,000,000 offer from Sara and a $500 offer from Gordon, it's easy to predict whose offer he will accept.  This is the point in the movie when hilarity is supposed to ensue.  Unfortunately, it does not.

We could go on from here and learn more about the storyline, but that's about it. The average viewer may find a little something here and there that's of interest, but all in all, we're left wondering about the point.

 Sometimes it seems that Hollywood has more money than they know what to do with and that is why films like these come about. As is often the case, this is not the fault of the actors involved. 

It seems that Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley did the best they could with the material at hand. Hurley has proved before that she can 'work' a film and Perry honestly has some of the greatest comedic timing we've seen when it comes to "Friends." 

The problem is that there just wasn't much to work with here and it shows. At the very least, we can come from this film having learned three things: a process server serves legal paperwork for a living, some movie tickets should be discounted, and "Serving Sara" would be better served  going straight to video.

Headline: S1m0ne creates convincing illusion
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
I've heard a lot of stories about how computers will one day replace people in everyday tasks, but I never took that message seriously until I saw this movie. In "S1m0ne," director Andrew Niccol shows us the power of deception and illusion – the same kind he showed us when he wrote "The Truman Show." 

The only difference is that in "S1m0ne," only one person knows the truth and the rest of the world is being kept in the dark. Despite its somewhat disturbing message regarding how disposable people are, it is a very dramatic film with an excellent cast. 

Al Pacino, along with the rest of the cast, gives a sensational performance. The plot is very well written. The writers obviously did  thorough research on computer simulations either before or while they wrote the script.

Once dubbed "mediocre" by the movie industry, director Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) has now assured himself a place at the bottom of the barrel. With his last three films all flops and the leading lady in his current movie quitting halfway through, it seems his career in show business has reached an early end. Not even his ex-wife and studio head, Elaine (Catherine Keener), will give him another chance. He tries to find a replacement leading lady, but nobody will work with him, except for Hank, (Elias Koteas) a computer genius/weirdo with a terminal eye tumor. 

He approaches Viktor with a proposition: to use a computer simulated actress that he designed to finish the job. He claims she can pass for the real thing and no one would be the wiser. Hank dies the next day and leaves the program entitled "Simulation One" to Viktor.

Now, Viktor Taransky is a man with nothing to lose, and as we all know, men with nothing to lose are likely to do crazy things. You can pretty much guess what happens next. At the beginning of the movie, he feels as if he's about to have a heart attack and when it's finished, he's too shocked to have one. Although nobody actually likes the story, they are all blown away by the outstanding performance of the new leading lady. 

And with that, Simulation One becomes Simone (played by Canadian model Rachel Roberts), Hollywood's new golden girl, practically perfect in every way, with the minor exception that she's not real. But then again, in Hollywood, what is? 

She becomes an overnight sensation and takes the world completely by surprise. She appears in magazines, advertisements, and even one or two talkshows, via satellite of course, but no one can say that they have actually met her in real life. 

Viktor creates an illusion using shadows, smoke and mirrors in ways that would impress  David Copperfield. Naturally, that only makes everyone want to find out about her even more, especially Max Sayer (Pruitt Taylor Vince) the head of Echo Magazine, who suspects foul play on Viktor's part.

It's clear to me that Andrew Niccol put a great deal of thought into this film. There is very little about it that moviegoers won't enjoy. I was somewhat perplexed when Rachel Roberts' name didn't appear in either the opening or closing credits. It was obviously on purpose, but for a minute there I thought that she really was a computer simulation. 

This movie brought up two very important points. Show business is constantly obsessed with perfection. The character of Simone would never have worked if she had a small wrinkle next to her nose. If there's one thing I've learned about perfection, it's that it doesn't exist in life. 

Also, what does this movie say about the future of acting, or of film-making in general for that matter? With computers becoming more advanced and virtual simulations more realistic, the idea of Simone is not that far-fetched. Is this the future of the movie industry? I hope not, it's artificial enough as it is. To quote Kevin Smith's "great philosopher" Jay: "I hate how fake Hollywood is."

Headline: Guests spoil Ashanti's debut
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
These days it seems that anything Ja-Rule and Irv Gotti touch turns into gold, or platinum for that matter: case in point, Ashanti Douglas. Bursting onto the scene through collaborations with Ja-Rule in "Always On Time" and Fat Joe in "What's Luv," both booming number one singles, Ashanti is one of the latest beautiful females to duet with a rapper. This recent trend in pop music, perfected by Ja-Rule and Jennifer Lopez, has proven to be marketing genius. 

Don't believe me? Take a look at Ashanti. The starlet has pushed over two million copies to date and has seen her self-titled album Ashanti reach the top of the Billboard charts, a huge accomplishment for any debut artist.

The album opens with an all-too-unfortunate "Intro" which showcases clips of her previous work and collaborations. The second track, the hit single "Foolish," combines strong vocals and a soft rhythm. It shows a glimpse of her potential to break free from her obvious influences and establish herself in the industry. The song is a great listen that describes love as something that will hurt and push you away, only to pull you right back. 

Enter Ja-Rule in "Happy," introducing Ashanti as "the princess of hip-hop and R&B." The song describes Ashanti's bliss at finding that special someone. With an enjoyable tune, the sound of delicate whistles and a great chorus, the single is already stirring a buzz. The midtempo, Brandy-esque "Leaving" starts beautifully &#8211; up until the two-minute mark, when Ja-Rule takes on the challenge of "singing." Unfortunately, he can't go two lines without using the "b" word on an otherwise sweet song. This is definitely one of the worst collaborations I've ever heard. Sadly for Ashanti, she has not been able to stray away from these partnerships and step forward on her own.

"Scared" is a brilliant track. In true R&B fashion, it is smooth and suave and deals with letting go of a relationship. With an awesome beat that sounds like it came straight from a B-horror movie, "Rescue" hooks you right in, and is easily one of the best tracks on the album.  

Just when I was getting impressed, a skit called "Fight" came on. This track is utterly pointless and stupid. It ends the relationship Ashanti was so gently singing about in previous tracks with a thuggish, vulgar rant that destroys her little-princess image, blemishing an otherwise solid album. Ashanti packs her biggest punch to date by taking pointers from P. Diddy's sample book and "borrowing" the late great Notorious B.I.G.'s "One More Chance" for the track "Unfoolish." 

Ultimately, Ashanti is a nice listen, but far from extraordinary. At times she dazzles you with impressive vocals, at others you cringe at the exposure of her weaknesses (which include not being able to hit the high notes on the last track "Thank You"). Ashanti, while lacking the skills of Aaliyah or Mary J. Blige, is vibrant and youthful. If she frees herself from intrusive collaborators, she could become a staple in the business for years to come.

Headline: BBC succeeds in getting students involved during Welcome Week
Author: Beatriz Simoes / Biscayne Bay Editor
&nbsp;
Last week Biscayne Bay students were treated to lots of free food and entertainment during Welcome Week provided by the Student Programming Council (SPC) and Panther Power.

	On the first day of classes students got to make their own music videos in Panther Square. The crew of Kramer Entertainments' Fun Flicks brought in a makeshift studio equipped with all the cameras and gadgets necessary produce a music video. They also brought along costumes for the students to wear. At the end of the production each student who participated got a copy of the video. 

	Junior Handy Mussote said he did not participate in the video making, but had a good time watching.

	"It was cool, something different," Mussote said.

Students also lined up for goofy Ids, caricatures, and free barbeque catered by Shorty's BBQ. 

	"I'm very happy to say that the day was a great success," Welcome Week Chair Marcela Velazquez said. 

	She said students were very involved and seemed to enjoy all activities. 

	On Thursday however, their main activity—wax hands—did not go through as planned. 

	"The wax didn't melt," Velazquez said "but we had other activities and we will just do the hands next week during Fall Fest."

	A pep rally was also held Thursday to get students pumped for FIU's first football game. 

	Panther Power led the rally. A rapper opened followed by dancers and speeches from BBC"s SGC President Adrian Carter and Student Affairs Vice President Brian Haynes, who welcomed students to FIU's new academic year.

	Many students turned out for the activities and for some free food. 

	"We expected a good turnout, but not this good," Panther Power President Sherilyn Lukas said.

 Mussote attended the pep rally but said he would not really call it that.

	"I was used to my rallies at high school, and this was different," he said. "The people from panther power were having a lot of fun, but many others were just sitting around eating."

	Lukas said students did have a very good time, so much that many hung around even after the rally had finished until the busses left for the game.

	About 60 to 70 students took the bus provided for the game, and many others drove or found other ways of transportation Lukas said.

	With Welcome Week and the football game past us the SPC is putting on Fall Fest this week. 

	Today, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. there will be a carnival by the flagpoles outside Wolfe University Center, where students will get many carnival foods and games. There will also be a live band and DJ.

Tomorrow students will be able to do some job networking at the Part Time Volunteer and Job Fair, and at night can see Lord of the Rings, The fellowship of the Ring at the drive in movie set up by Bay Vista Housing.

On Thursday a large number of students are expected to participate in Laser Tag.

"This is the first time we have this here, and it should attract a lot of people," SPC President Robin Miller said.

Laser Tag is a game played in a dark room—which will be set up in Panther Square—where people shoot at each other with laser guns. 

At 9 p.m. there will be a comedy featuring Talent & Romeo from Deaf Comedy Jam and an after party at the ballroom will follow.

Miller said the SPC crew is ready and to put on a great Fall Fest.

 "People like Marcela [Velazquez] have put in overtime," he said, "and many other people are working really hard at these events."

Headline: Football routs Peacocks with 27-3 win
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
FIU football arrived in a big way Thursday night.

The Golden Panthers dominated the first half and then cruised to a 27-3 win over St. Peter's College in front of a sell-out crowd of 17,314 at FIU's Community Stadium.

"I told the players I'd build them a house, I'd build them a field, I'd build them a stadium and like a field of dreams, we built it and they came," an emotional FIU head coach Don Strock said. "Great players make great coaches."

All of FIU's scoring came in the game's first 28 minutes as the Golden Panthers got into the endzone on four of the team's first five possessions.

"Things didn't happen the way we wanted them to early," St. Peter's coach Rob Stern said. "The first 15 minutes of the game got away from us. The big turning point was that first drive. [FIU] put the ball on the ground twice. Last year we got 47 turnovers. If we get those plays, maybe things will go differently."

FIU's first-half play calling appeared to have St. Peter's on its heels for most of the 30 minutes.

Jamie Burke started the fireworks early when he completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to fullback Jerrid Lundstedt, who caught the ball just shy of the endzone before sneaking it over the goal line. The score came with 8:18 remaining in the first quarter and opened the door for what would become a route.

Tori Robinson fumbled twice on the drive, but FIU recovered to preserve the scoring opportunity.

Burke struck again with 1:47 remaining in the opening quarter, when the true-freshman took a quarterback draw up the middle for a 6-yard touchdown run, giving FIU a 13-0 lead.

That second score was set-up when John Haritan blocked a punt.

"What we did early was spread them out with four wide receivers," Strock said. "We didn't think they had the personnel to match up. They were in their base defense and we had guys running free through the middle of the field and we made a couple of plays.

Burke finished the game with 115 yards on 10-13 passing and two touchdowns.

Burke's longest completion of the game came with the Golden Panthers leading 19-0. FIU put the game out of St. Peter's reach when Cory McKinney caught a 52-yard pass from Burke and raced down the right sideline for a 27-0 lead. 

McKinney finished with 103 yards on 3 catches.

Julius Eppinger, Harold Leath and Everett Mitchell came up with key catches during the game, combining for five receptions and 69 yards.

FIU's four touchdowns came against a Peacock defense that ranked No. 1 in Division 1AA defense last season, but lost six starters from that team.

St. Peter's allowed only six touchdowns over its final nine games last season, allowing 8.2 points per game, on its way to a 10-1 record.

"We knew what they did last year, and we knew what we had to do," Burke said.

Trailing by the same score at halftime, St. Peter's refused to abandon its wing-T, option offense and never got back into the game, despite owning a five-minute advantage in possession time.

Rashod Smith and Robinson combined for 82 yards rushing for FIU and Smith scored on a 2-yard run in the second quarter.

Both teams rushed for over 100 yards, with the Peacocks running for 143, but FIU won the game in the air. The Golden Panthers out-gained St. Peter's 167-76 in the passing game.

FIU's defense came up strong on third down, stopping St. Peter's on 14 of 15 chances.

Haritan and Nick Turnbull led the Golden Panthers with six tackles each and Nick Carreño recorded the team's only sack. Both Turnbull and Gentry Jackson had interceptions.

The score could have been more lopsided.

The Golden Panthers had a John Haritan interception, deep in St. Peter's territory, called back on a penalty and fumbled five times, losing two. FIU also missed two extra-point attempts.

St. Peter's lone score came on James Galea's 32-yard field goal with 4:33 remaining in the third quarter. Those were the only points of the second half.

"Once we got ahead, it was hard for them to run the ball and grind it out, making it hard for them to catch up," Strock said.

"In college football, guys just don't come out and lay down," Stern said. "They played hard in the second half. I think we showed a little better what St. Peter's football is all about in the second half. Hats off to those guys. They're going to have a successful year."

Andre Harris, the Peacocks' starting quarterback, completed five of 12 passes for 28 yards. He also rushed 12 times for 48 yards.

Derek Clayton led all rushers with 72 yards.

FIU will travel to Elon and St. Peter's plays at Fordham on Sept. 7.

Headline: 'Banda del Sol' makes debut at inaugural football game
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"La Banda del Sol" made its first performance at halftime during the Golden Panthers' inaugural football game last Thursday.

This is the first year FIU has a marching band. It is composed of 120 members; 86 winds and percussion, 30 color guards and four drum majors.

"All 120 members have different majors. It ranges from nursing to business to music education," said music education major Zoila Araica who is one of the drum majors. 

Under the direction of Dr. Greg Martin the band has learned two different shows. They are currently working on a third one and will be learning two more. 

"We want to have different shows for the games. We want to entertain and not bore the crowd with the same show," Martin said.

During summer, the band met up for band camp. They rehearsed for nine days from 8:30 a.m. &#8211; 9 p.m. 

Now, during the fall semester, the band regularly rehearses Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30 p.m. &#8211; 8:30 p.m.  

Aside from performing at all the home football games and two road games, the band also has plans for exhibition performances at several high school marching band competitions, like the Florida BandMasters Association Festival.

The band will also be marching in a nationally televised Thanksgiving Day parade held at Miami Beach and will make an appearance at the FIU music festival. 

Martin is not the only one in charge of the band.

 Five other instructors help out on the field during rehearsals &#8211; teaching assistants  James Yaques, Chris Probst and Jordan Richman and color guard instructor Louis Betances and percussion instructor Michael Launious. 

"I am very thankful for my instructors. The work is too overwhelming for just one person and they have helped me tremendously," Martin said.

Students must audition to join the band. 

"The audition is no big deal really. It's just for me to see at what level my musicians are at," Martin said.

Martin also said that as the band expands and recruits more members the audition requirements will be a little more intense and selective.  

This year, members received a $500 music scholarship. Section leaders and drum majors received a little more. 

"The reason they got more is because when the FIU administration asks for a small pep band type group to play I only send them. They have less strenuous school schedules so that they can be at extra performances," Martin said.

Band members are students first added Martin. Meaning he is very concerned about their education and makes sure they put school first. 

"I am very protective of the student's time," Martin said. 

Occasionally, the band will feature the Dazzlers as part of their show. For instance, at the homecoming game, the band will do a Michael Jackson retro theme and will invite the Dazzlers to join them.

The band encourages audience participation. Listen out for their drum cadences and beats, as well the "Panther Fanfare" that was commissioned especially for them. 

"So far the band is off to a great start and we have all become one family," Araica said. 

"The band did a really good job for their first performance. I know their time is limited but I'm very proud of them and there uniforms were great," SGC President Jessica Morffi said. 

Anyone who signed up for "Golden Panther Band" receives one art credit toward their core curriculum.

Anyone interested in playing can sign up for "Golden Panther Band" in the spring. That semester, the band will be in a concert, not a marching setting.

Headline: Students pay for grammar exam
Author: Sheaon Reid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since the late 1980s, the School of Journalism and Mass Communications has administered a language-skills test, otherwise known as the grammar test, in many of its classes and has also made it a prerequisite for others. The test was administered free until July 1. Students must now pay $15 each time they take the test. 

All students in the school are required to take this test at least three times before graduation. Journalism majors may have to take the test as many as five times according to the classes they have to take.

"I find the test to be a pain in the butt," journalism major Raul Cernuda said. "It is a headache having to pay for something you are already forced to take."

Chris Dorelien, a transfer student seeking a masters degree in advertising, said he was not aware of the fee and feels students should only pay once or at least have help from student government. 

On the other hand, some students see themselves as not having much choice.

"I think the fee is ridiculous," advertising major Anais Guerra said, "but if I have to [take the test], then hey, I don't have much choice."

 "Other schools charge their students a fee of $25 to take similar language tests," Department of Journalism and Broadcasting Chair Michael McQueen said. "We figure $15 will be more than $5 but less than $25 to maintain the new system."

McQueen explained that it is expensive to administer such a test.

During the late `80s the language-skills test was still administered by hand. A computerized version of the test was developed in 1995 and administering it became expensive since it requires the purchase of hardware and software and the maintenance and updating of both, McQueen said.

Expenses also include new personnel to run the labs and software consultants specializing in this system. 	

In addition, the state's budget cut and the increase in enrollment at the SJMC – nearly 1000 students are now enrolled – have also forced the school to put a price on the test.

McQueen also said the previous software used for the test became faulty.

There were cases of exams being lost or disappearing while students were taking the test. Most of the time, it was impossible to retrieve the exams or to figure out what went wrong. 

To solve this problem, the SJMC hired a private company, The Word Association, to create a new system and maintain the program.

This decision was made by the board, which includes Dean J. Arthur Heise, Associate Dean Lillian Lodge Kopenhaver, Department of Advertising and Public Relations Chair Pat Rose, Writing Program Director Kevin Hall and McQueen.   

The first step in taking the test includes obtaining a language-skills permit from either a secretary in Academic 2-310 or from the lab located in Academic 2-301. Once the permit is obtained, it must be taken to the cashier's office with the payment of $15, after which you are given a receipt. The receipt is taken to the lab personnel for verification. After the receipt is verified, you are allowed to take the test. 

The actual grammar test itself has to be taken in the SJMC lab. Practice tests, however, can be taken at either any lab on campus or from a computer at home. Before taking the practice test, one must first obtain a password from the lab assistant. Students are allowed to take the practice test up to 10 times. 

In addition to the practice test, Power Point presentations are also available online to aid students and give them a better feel for the English language. 

SJMC not only changed the way they will administer the test, but they also changed the entrance and exit scores needed for some of their courses. 

The entrance score to get into MMC 3104, Writing Strategies, rose from 63 to 65. The exit score, rose from 73 to 75. Stduents have three chances to achieve the required exit score. If they do not, a D will be the highest grade they can receive and they will have to retake the course.   

MMC 3104 is not the only course in the SJMC that requires students to take the language-skills test. Journalism majors will also need to take the language-skills test to be admitted into the following courses: Print News Reporting, Feature Writing, News and Public Affairs Reporting and On-line Magazine and Newscast. 

Advertising and public relations majors will also need to take the language-skills test to be admitted to Integrated Communications Campaign. 

What does this mean for journalism and mass communications students? It means taking the language-skills test at least four times and paying $60.

"I understand most students are going to think it's unfair, having someone they don't know randomly choose questions they have to answer and pass with a certain score," McQueen said. "But [students] must understand the test is for them so they will have a strong sense of grammar and eventually improve their writing.

"As an Editor, I would be reluctant to hire anyone who cannot pass a university's grammar test."

Headline: Group tries to create gay frat
Author: Adriana Oliva / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Joining the 102 interest groups at FIU, a new organization made up of 14 male members will now be added to the list as of fall 2002. They have given themselves the name Gamma Lambda Mu. 

Gamma Lambda Mu is a predominately gay organization, which also welcomes anyone who is gay friendly. 

"What we basically want to establish is a brotherhood support system for gay males," visual arts major Mario Campa, who is the founder of the organization, said.

FIU already has an on campus organization for gay and lesbian students. The Stonewall Student Union is an organization dedicated to supporting the needs of the gay, lesbian and bisexual students at FIU and its community.

The main difference between Stonewall and Gamma Lambda Mu is that Gamma Lambda Mu will only be catering to males.

"Our purpose is to create a non-political support system for gay male college students interested in developing [them]selves under the principle of brotherhood," Campa said. 

Gamma Lambda is allied with Stonewall. Four Gammas are already Stonewall members. 

So far, recruiting has only taken place through word of mouth. Campa said that they intend on using all the possible resources offered through FIU to let students know that Gamma Lambda Mu exists. Their promotion will consist of word of mouth, flyers, ads in the newspaper and SOC club fair, as well as wearing shirts that bear the organization's logo and name. 

Three meetings have been held, as well as a separate presentation at one of the Stonewall meetings. 

Karen Katz, coordinator of Campus Life for Greek Affairs, has been helping out the organization. She assisted with its paperwork such as the constitution, by laws and the actual forms needed to become an established organization on campus. 

"It's difficult to start an organization from scratch, especially since in the long run they plan on becoming a fraternity," Katz said. "However I am very pleased to help them because I truly feel they are bringing something different to the FIU community."

To acheive their long-term goal of becoming a fraternity, the members of Gamma Lambda Mu must follow certain steps.

"To become a fraternity, first you need to be an interest group, followed by a colony, and finally you can approach the IFC to have them vote and allow the organization to become a frat," Katz said.

Campa as well as Gamma Lambda Mu co-founder Jorge Casas have been doing research since the beginning of summer 2002. They search for other gay fraternities at different campuses throughout the United States.

"Most of our research is done online via websites and emails,"   Casas, a psychology major, said.

Eventually the group would like to get picked up by a national fraternity and establish a chapter at FIU. 

While the organization is looking into the future, they have not forgotten the present. They will assist Dance Marathon and are considering participating in AIDS walks.

Gamma Lambda Mu plans on having social events with other organizations, not just with Greek organizaions.

There are requirements to get into the organization. One has to meet the GPA requirement, be an FIU student and if not gay, must be gay-friendly. 

"Gamma Lambda Mu brings diversity onto our campus. But mostly we want to make sure that any new organization is beneficial for our greek community," Assistant Greek Coordinator Todd Sullivan said. 

Campa, who is also a peer advisor, said he started looking into the possibility of a gay fraternity because a lot of newcomers approach him and asked him if one exists. 

So far, a lot of support and encouragement have been given to the organization not only by Katz, but by other peers and greeks. 

"I think it's a good thing for the greek community.  For one, FIU's vision is to provide hope, knowledge, and opportunity to everyone, which includes people of all cultures, race or sexual preferences.  So this is just one step of proving what we are all about. I think a new fraternity like this one will encourage more people to join the Greek system," Alpha Xi Delta President Jennifer Canals said.

Although there seems to be a lot of support, there are still some people who are skeptical.

"While I do feel that such an organization would add to the diversity of our greek system, I do however worry that a men's fraternity based solely on sexual preferences would have a difficult time adapting,"  Pi Kappa Phi President Clayton Solomon said. "I am also concerned about what reverberations it may have on other fraternities.

"It is important to understand that many fraternities currently do not discriminate on sexual preference, making me wonder why a separate organization is necessary."

For now the group is just trying to build a solid foundation for the future and other students to come. 

"We are very positive and motivated and feel that our goals will get accomplished," Campa said.
