Headline: Hospitality building to be finished by '08

&nbsp;
Renovations are underway at the Hospitality Management Building, the oldest building at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Some of the changes include replacing the building's roof and repaving the Bayside Plaza.

They will be worked on through the Facilities Management department until 2008, according to Lee C. Dickson, associate dean for the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.

Neither project manager Honoriu Filimon nor Victor Citarella, associate vice president of Facilities Management, were available for comment about the costs of the project and which construction company was hired for the project.

Flyers have been posted around the building alerting students of closed pathways, but detours are still affecting those trying to get to class.

"These improvements are a good thing for the school, but they should have done all this during the summer...now that classes have started, they have begun with the work which isn't the best timing," said Arturo Macias, hospitality major.

Dickson said there was never an ideal time for renovations to take place.

"There were lots of students here for Summer semester courses so there isn't any protracted period when there aren't students present except for the one or two weeks between semesters," he said.

The new plaza, located outside the building next to the Biscayne Bay, will have its 30 year-old cracking Chattahoochee floor replaced with pavers; it became hazardous with students tripping over the uneven, patchy ground, according to Dickson.

While the plaza is renovated, there have been several walking detours. As a result, the only entrances to the building are currently from the patio's south section.

Faculty such as Steven V. Molls, however, welcome the changes.

"I was not a big fan of the Chattahoochee pebbles as they were cracked and worn out. The very minor inconvenience of walking around the building is tolerable for the short time because the new brick pavers look gorgeous and should be a clean, modern and welcome addition to our building," he said. 

A picnic lunch will be held Sept. 19 to celebrate the plaza's reopening.

The introduction of high-impact, storm resistant glass on the first and second floor of the building will be installed by 2008. 

The glass will improve the building's strength, avoid damage caused by South Florida's uncertain weather and help faculty, Dickson said.

"It is quite an operation when there is a storm coming and the maintenance staff has to come from facilities and put shutters manually on the first floor windows," he said. 

The last major project involves replacing the 30 year-old, weather-patched roof.

The current roof has four air conditioning units and equipment including fans that deliver exhaust from classroom kitchens to the outside of the building. Because of this, swapping the old roof with a new one will pose a problem, Dickson said,

"Work will have to be done in sections, so as they remove one air conditioning unit the others are still working. We can't go with the idea of not having air conditioning in the building for a month and half, or not use the food labs, we have classes in those labs everyday," he said.

The building's bathrooms will be remodeled sometime next year, according to Dickson, and pressure cleaning the building's walls will signal the project's completion.

"All the infrastructure things that are 30 years-old will have been rehabilitated and the building should be first class," Dickson said.

Headline: Club promotes use of sign language
Author: Isaac Cruz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The members of Flying Fingers, a club that was started last summer, hope to increase awareness at FIU about the hearing-impaired and mute communities.

Brittney Eichler, the club's president, has begun a petition through the club to bring back sign language classes to FIU. 

"We want to start a petition because [we] have a large community [at University Park]," Eichler said. "Our main concern is FIU offering sign language classes again and it is up to them where [the classes] are going to be offered at."

Joanna Lindsay, the club's advisor, supports the petition.

"FIU used to provide sign language classes…there weren't enough students. It would help the school and the [student body]. I know students who have taken the classes…and taught others how to use it," Lindsay said. 

The club began as a group on Facebook.com, a networking Web site, which escalated to personal meetings and then as a club at the Biscayne Bay Campus, according to Eichler.

"The club is not only for the hearing impaired and mute, it is open to all students," Eichler said.

"Our basic goals are to provide an environment for the deaf and hearing impaired [where the student body] is able to get together and familiarize with one another," she said.

During the club meetings, everything is done by sign language, but people are more than welcome to join and be taught how to perform sign language, Eichler said.

"Learning from a book is a complete opposite from learning it in a small group. Last semester, we had one member who didn't know sign language and learned [from us]. Those who know sign language and don't mind [teaching] others, help them learn and interact. Just like there are slang words in any verbal language, there is slang in sign language and we teach members the basics with personal classes and then  [teach them] as a club," she said.

Flying Fingers club members look for different ways to address students about the inability to speak or hear. 

During a meeting in the fall, club members watched the movie Cars with captions.

The club also has social outings at Dave & Buster's in Dolphin Mall in order to get the members together, according to Eichler.

These social dates are important for club members to intermingle, said Melanie Castronovo, activities director.

"It is part of our culture," Castronovo said. "Learning the language [is to] learn the culture…to interact."

Because Eichler and most of the club members are based at UP, the club is interested in moving their meetings out of BBC, where they were originally based. The official transition to UP has not been made yet, Eichler said.

The club has already begun to advertise more at UP.

Last summer, club members passed out flyers during a club fair at UP to inform students about their goals and what they are all about.

According to Eichler, the club is planning to have meetings at UP once a month, Tuesdays from 5-6:15 p.m., depending on the members' availability.

They hope to acquire a room for future meetings at UP when they become an official club there, Eichler said.

Castronovo wants all students interested in joining to do so.

"We encourage people to join. [Students need] no experience, just have an interest and come on in!" 

Anyone interested in joining the club can add the club's profile to their Facebook group or e-mail flying_fingers_fiu@yahoo.com.

Headline: MAKING IT WORK: Long-distance relationships take time, effort to maintain
Author: Danielle King / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Sitting outside of the Graham Center, a young woman, no older than 20, tries to hold back the tears while saying good-bye to the person on the other side of the phone. 

"I don't know how long I can hold on to this relationship," she said into the phone. "You're all the way in California and I'm in Florida. It's too far."

Long-distance relationships such as these are common among college students, particularly those who leave their significant others when going away to college. 

In the book Relationships for Dummies, Dr. Kate M. Wachs exposes different myths that are commonly thought about long-distance relationships. One myth mentioned is "Distance makes the heart grow fonder." 

According to Dr. Wachs, that saying might hold true when it is applied to a couple who is arguing, or when one person goes away for several days and the other person realizes that they miss and love the person. 

But, when it comes to a couple that spends weeks, maybe months away from each other, the distance can sometimes bring about suspicions. 

For senior Krizia Aguliera whose boyfriend resides in a different state, there is a constant worry of whether the other person is holding onto secrets.

"Even if you trust someone, the distance is going to tamper that trust," she said. "It starts to become easier to cheat."

Because of that distance, one person may start questioning why a boyfriend or girlfriend is not at their dorm room on a school night or why a significant other didn't answer the call that is expected at 9 p.m. every night. 

Dr. Wachs said that "relationships need frequent, in person time to flourish;" people become intimate with one another by sharing their inner most secrets and desires.

For couples looking for advice on maintaining a successful long distance relationship, there are many books and web  sites that contain some tips, including education­-portal.com, a web site dedicated to helping students with relationships and other college topics.

Here are some tips from the web site for those that are trying to make a long distance relationship work:

Establish trust: "Trust is very hard to maintain in a long-distance relationship,"  student Enrica Rymer, whose in a long-distance relationship herself, said.

"Don't lie," she said. "If you want the relationship to work, you have to be upfront. It becomes even more important in a long-distance relationship because your word is all you have. If there is no trust, love is hard to follow."

Phone calls and E-mails could start to get redundant. It's recommended that trying something different such as planning a date over the phone to watch a movie or going to the beach and looking at the stars could be your best date ever. 

Currently in a relationship that has seen its share of distance, Joy Deitrich, a junior, highly recommended using the element of surprise.

"Be spontaneous," she said. "Suprising your partner by getting on a plane and flying to see them is really exciting. Or even the simplest thing as a letter can mean so much."

Be thoughtful. Even though both of you are miles apart, romance hasn't died -  romantic gestures can really spice up a relationship. A love note or flowers are just a couple of romantic gestures the website recommends.

Beware of temptation; it's everywhere and even more so because you're apart. Deitrich emphasizes that it is possible for long-distance relationships to work despite the temptation to cheat.

Headline: Model of Health...a wellness column: Restless leg syndrome characterized by uncontrollable urges
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Catherine M, as she identifies herself in the RLSRest forum in www.rlsrest.com, shares her story concerning her physical state. 

She is 61-years-old and suffers from the disorder known as restless leg syndrome (RLS). 

"While I have had restless leg syndrome most of my life, only recently did I find out there was a name and a condition to describe what was going on with me," Catherine said. 

She recalls swinging her legs and constantly shifting in her seat every time she was sitting down for long periods of time. 

"My parents took to calling me the 'wiggle worm'," she said.

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), some researchers estimate that RLS affects as many as 12 million Americans, but others estimate a much higher number since RLS is thought to be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. 

"Physicians often dismissed the weird feelings in my legs as growing pains," Catherine said.

According to NINDS, RLS is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move when at rest in an effort to relieve these feelings. 

As a consequence, daily activities as sleep and work are easily disrupted.

The feelings are described as creeping, itching, pulling, creepy-crawly, tugging or gnawing, according to the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation. 

The cause of RLS is unknown, but a family history of the condition is seen in approximately 50 percnt of such cases, said NINDS. 

According to the RLS Foundation, some factors that appear to be related are an iron or vitamin deficiency, allergy and depression medications, chronic diseases, alcohol, caffeine and tobacco intake. 

Some pregnant women experience RLS, but for most, the symptoms usually disappear within four weeks after delivery, according to NINDS. 

Engaging in activities that keep the mind off focusing on the RLS symptoms, eliminating symptom-producing substances and taking vitamin and mineral supplements as necessary, will reduce the disturbing sensations. 	

RLS Awareness Week starts Sunday Sept. 23 and ends Saturday Sept.29. 

The project is a nation-wide moonlight walk to support the RLS Foundation.

The moonlight event is a do-it-yourself walk-a-thon because it can be done anywhere with your friends, family and local support groups.

Headline: Disney sticks with actress despite nude photo controversy
Author: ID Bauder / AP Wire
&nbsp;
NEW YORK (AP) - The Walt Disney Co. is sticking with the 18-year-old star of its wildly successful "High School Musical" franchise, despite her "lapse in judgment" in posing for racy photos that were leaked to the Internet.

Vanessa Hudgens apologized Friday for the photos, which show her smiling as she posed naked and in underwear in a bedroom with a red curtain behind her.

"Vanessa has apologized for what was obviously a lapse in judgment," said Disney Channel spokeswoman Patti McTeague. "We hope she's learned a valuable lesson."

She said negotiations were ongoing to land all the actors for a "High School Musical 3" feature film - including Hudgens.

Hudgens, who played the brainy Gabriella in the first two made-for-cable TV movies, told her fans she was sorry.

"I am embarrassed over this situation and regret having ever taken these photos," she said. "I am thankful for the support of my family and friends."

Hudgens' publicist, Jill Fritzo, wouldn't say anything about who took the pictures and how they slipped out onto the Internet.

The bookworm Gabriella was the love interest of Troy, the basketball star played by pinup king Zac Efron. The sequel's premiere on Disney Channel last month attracted more than 17 million viewers, making it the summer's most-watched TV program.

Hudgen is a superstar among the preteen set, and Disney has spun a wide merchandising net around the series with albums and concert tours. She and Efron reportedly date in real life, making them big attractions for celebrity magazines.

The films' wholesome nature - for a company that has made its name on family-friendly fare for generations - is a big part of its success. Parents can relax with their children watching, knowing it won't make for any uncomfortable questions.

Gabriella and Troy coo, they make googly eyes, they barely kiss. Gabriella would doubtlessly blush at the idea of a young actress posing for nude photos.

If Disney executives had cut ties to Hudgens, not wanting the company's name associated with anything not G-rated, they would have run the risk of upsetting a formula that has made the company millions upon millions of dollars.

How would parents explain to the show's young fans that the old Gabriella was being replaced by another actress?

"That's her private life, not her public life. That picture got leaked by somebody who broke a trust with her," said Michele Smith of Westborough, Mass., whose 8-year-old daughter Kathryn is a devoted "High School Musical" fan.

Dropping her from future movies or other "High School Musical" projects would not only be unfair to Hudgens but to fans such as Kathryn, Smith said.

"If Vanessa is not in the movie, my daughter would not be so excited to see it," she said.

Smith said she hopes that Kathryn doesn't hear about the photo but, if she does, she's prepared to talk about it. She'll say that it's something private for Vanessa that shouldn't have been shared.

The best thing for Disney was to do nothing, said Michael Levine, a Hollywood image consultant and author of 18 books.

"What they shouldn't do is make a bigger deal out of it than is necessary," he said. "The picture is not salacious."

Michael Sands, a publicist whose clients have included the divorce attorney for Britney Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline, said Hudgens should be commended for coming forward quickly and saying it was her pictures.

"She's very talented and this is a big cash cow for Disney," he said.

Headline: DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTER: Assistance provided for students with disabilities
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Disabled students who need a bit of extra help with academic tasks at FIU can turn to the Disability Resource Center, whose entrance is in the piano room on the first floor of the Graham Center.	

"We work as a liaison between the University and the students," said Assistant DRC Director Beverly Trott. "We deal with every type of disability known to man."

The DRC's mission is to provide students with disabilities the services they require to successfully graduate. 

The center services, on average, 500 to 600 students, according to Interim Director Amanda Niguidula. 

But Assistant Director Joanna Lindsay commented that despite the number of students in the DRC, they are given the best services possible.

"Its not about their disabilities, its about their abilities," Lindsay said. 

Among the core services the center offers is qualifying students and determining that a student has a disability. 

"Our primary reason for existing in the University is to be the eyes of our University community and the eyes of the law to say the person is qualified for the purposes of higher education as having a disability," Niguidula said.  

Niguidula also said that the DRC does not seek out students and that they must come to the center themselves before any service can begin.

"There is no master list or profile of disabled students," Niguidula said. 

If a student was recently made aware they have or might have a disability, the DRC can refer him or her to a licensed clinical psychologist at the Biscayne Bay Campus to perform psycho-educational testing, which can determine whether there is a disability in terms of a learning or attention deficit hyperactive disorder.  

The test is only available for FIU students and costs $250; taking the test outside of the University can cost thousands of dollars. 

After a student is registered with the DRC, the student's functional limitations are determined. 

Once that step is completed, the center works with the student's professors to make known any special academic accommodations the student requires. 

Accommodations range from extra time on tests, note takers and audio textbooks to lab assistants and other services. 

The DRC also has two assistive technology computer labs with programs tailored to suit the needs of the disabled.

Services aside, the DRC is about hard work. 

"This is not an easy out," Niguidula said in response to thinking that by registering with the DRC, disabled students gain some sort of an advantage. "Our students really have had to work harder if not as hard as other students."

Academically, disabled students perform the same work as any other student.

"When they first come to register, they will sometimes comment that they are concerned that their diploma or degree will be viewed as less then," Niguidula said. "We assure them that they have to work just as hard as other students." 

Trott said that registering with the DRC makes the difference between receiving a D or a C in a class to receiving a B or an A for a disabled student. 

According to Niguidula, one concern many students have is confidentiality. 

Any student registering with the DRC has the same level of confidentiality as with any doctor. 

Information on a disabled student is only shared with FIU faculty - an action that  first requires the student to sign a consent form. 

The DRC will be hosting several events throughout the Fall semester aimed at promoting awareness of the disabled. 

Oct. 17 will be the National Disability Mentoring Day. 

NDMD is sponsored by the American Association of People with Disabilities and started in 1999. 

Nov. 14 marks the start of the Spinal Cord Injury Awareness week. 

During the week, various presentations on spinal cord injuries and those who have them will be given as well as tips on how to avoid injuring the spinal cord. 

The DRC is also in the process of bringing the Flying Fingers club from BBC to University Park. 

The club promotes interest in sign language and lobbies for more campus events to have a sign language interpreter. 

Students interested in volunteering at the DRC need to visit the Center for Leadership and Service in GC 242.

Headline: Museum to open in 2008
Author: Susana Rodriguez / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
It began in 1977 as a 2,000 square foot student gallery in University Park's Primera Casa building. Now, the Frost Art Museum has grown into a 46,000 square foot building that stands on its own.

The new building's construction, from contract negotiations to completion, has been in progress for almost six years.

In a September 2003 interview with The Beacon, University President Modesto A. Maidique said construction would be "well underway." 

Later that same year, FIU Magazine reported the groundbreaking had taken place Nov. 16 and expected the building to open in 2005. 

August of 2006 saw The Beacon reporting that construction was due for completion in April or May of 2007, a picture of the building's taped and sheeted façade accompanying the article. 

The museum's membership Web page anticipated its opening in Spring 2008, three years past the initial estimate.

But it has been pushed up yet again to Fall 2008. 

"We wanted to actually open in November, December of 2008," said Patricia Frost, a member of FIU's Board of Trustees whom the museum is named after. 

"Why did we want to do that? Because it would give us more visibility at the Frost Art Museum with more people that fly into Miami for Art Basel; we wanted them to be able to come to us ... so it was an intentional decision."

Frost refers to Art Basel Miami Beach, an annual show drawing collectors, artists and other art aficionados from around the world.

The new museum building will offer over 9,000 square feet of exhibition space in nine galleries, three of which will be home to the museum's permanent collection, according to FIU Magazine's Fall 2003 issue.

"There's 6,000 pieces in the collection," said Carol Damian, professor of art history in the College of Architecture and the Arts.      

"The majority of those pieces are really works on paper - drawings, prints, posters - so 6,000 sounds daunting but once you eliminate that and place those in their own environments ... There's going to be a print study room where you can be able to pull open drawers and look at hundreds and hundreds of things because you can't put hundreds of prints on the wall. Obviously, that's just inconceivable."

The Saatchi Gallery online, the contemporary art museum's  Web site where other museums can post their own profiles, lists the Frost Art Museum's collection as having   5,153 print and paper works, 256 photographs, 673 Pre-Columbian objects and 857 paintings, including 45 pieces purchased from FIU studio program students over the past 27 years. 

Within these numbers are works by contemporary masters like Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, and Robert Rauschenberg. There is also popular Haitian and Brazilian art, Mayan and Incan cultural artifacts, as well as the fostered collections of the Cintas Foundation Fellows and the defunct Metropolitan Museum and Art Center of Coral Gables.

"I think that the most important thing is that, because of the space, we're going to be able to create a university museum with a study collection and have an exhibition schedule that's going to reflect the diversity of the community," Damian said.

Two exhibitions will inaugurate the new building: a Smithsonian Art Museum exhibit curated by Virginia Mecklenburg, according to Frost, and an orchestration by Damian that will focus on the figure as represented within the museum's permanent collection.

"Going through the images and trying to come up with some sort of a curatorial vision, how do you look at 6,000 objects and what do you see," Damian said. "I came up with a number of different ideas going through and finally realized that the figure is so universal - from a beautiful African fetish figure to a Mexican figurine to a sculpture by a great American sculptor or images that run the gamut from Andy Warhol working with the figure to nineteenth century and more traditional images of the figure."

There will be site-specific art commissioned to decorate the reception area of the new building in accordance with Florida's Art in State Buildings program. 

Yann Weymouth, the architect, envisioned banners that would hang down the walls of the three- story area and could be changed seasonally, according to Damian. 

The deadline for submissions was Aug. 31 and applications are yet to be compiled, according to Damian.

For Frost, who was involved with Weymouth and the building's design, it's seeing the museum in operation and the community enjoying it that excites her most.

"We hope that this is an encyclopedic type of art museum where it will offer to the community things that they might never have ever seen again, or will see or hope to see in the future," Frost said. "For us this is the interface with the community, the students and the faculty."

Headline: Iran needs to be taught a lesson
Author: Julio Ortiz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It's no secret that the Iranian regime is an insane collective of radical religious lunatics with a president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, intent on "wiping Israel off the map," which he said two years ago in a speech to 4,000 students.   

He publicly stated that he does not believe the Holocaust ever happened and hosted a conference last year to discuss the validity of the Holocaust as a historical event. This alone is enough to definitively prove the regime is utterly mad. 

Israel has not taken Iran's threats lightly and neither has the United States. Iran's nuclear ambitions for "peaceful nuclear energy" are as bad a joke as Bob Saget on HBO. 

Iran constantly says their efforts to produce nuclear power are simply for electrical purposes, not for military use. That would be a valid statement if it weren't for their abundance of natural resources. 

Iran ranks second in the world in terms of natural gas production, third in oil production and averages around 4 billion barrels of oil per day. 

Iran simply lusts to become a regional superpower and in order to achieve that, it needs big guns.Those big guns are nuclear weapons : weapons of mass destruction , or, as our very special president would call them, "New-q-lur" weapons.

 The reason Iran wants to acquire WMDs is simply to challenge the current role the United States is playing in the Middle East and the relations it has with the Saudi government and oil. The Iranians view the U.S. encroachment as a threat to their future plans and development of a regional empire.

If Iran were able to produce a nuclear arsenal, it would have greater bargaining power when dealing with the United States. According to CNN, Iran just recently reached its goal of activating 3,000 new centrifuges which can enrich Uranium for nuclear production. 

The United Nations retaliated to Iran's nuclear efforts with threats of new sanctions, in spite of the fact that Iran has been completely oblivious to any sanctions imposed on them in the past. 

Bush recently warned the world of the threat of a potential "nuclear holocaust" from Iran. Regardless of all the rhetoric from either the United States or the United Nations, only calculated military force can prevent Iran from attaining nuclear capability. 

Israel has been preparing their forces for a possible strike on Iranian nuclear production facilities, as well has the United States. which has sent several naval vessels and a battle group to the Persian Gulf.

There have also been rumors floating around the Internet on popular blogs, specifically the Daily Kos, a liberal political Web site, which claims to have inside information from a sailor stationed on a U.S. aircraft carrier, that contradicts what the government tells us about Iran. There has definitely been some debate on whether the United States will or will not strike Iran militarily - the lower decks of the aircraft carrier have been bustling around reminiscent of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. 

I've always viewed the world as a big classroom. There are good students who come to class, pay attention, and are respectful to the teacher and other classmates, and then are the bad students. Some are just misguided and can be helped and then there are some students who piss everyone off. Even if we reprimand them they're still as reckless and idiotic as Lindsay Lohan in a sports car or Michael Vick in a dog kennel. Sometimes the teacher can only do one thing. Slap them across the face with a ruler and maybe they'll rethink their actions. We should do the same with Iran.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Baptist Medical Plaza eager to serve FIU community
Author: Luis Bellmas / South Region Director / Baptist Outpatient Services 
&nbsp;
In response to Christina Veiga's recent article, "Health Services: Fees, services increase," I thought we'd clarify some details.

Baptist Health South Florida is very excited about offering our healthcare services to the FIU community, in addition to the services provided at the University Park General Medical Clinic. As you may have heard, our newest facility, Baptist Medical Plaza at Tamiami Trail, located at 14660 SW 8 Street, opened recently and offers urgent care from 11 a.m.-11 p.m. 

The goal is to offer the UP community access to quality healthcare provided by board-certified doctors, especially when the General Medical Clinic is not accessible.

In addition, we are working with Dr. Robert Dollinger and his staff to ensure that all students who are treated at our site have proper continuation of care, as all records and reports from the urgent care center will be communicated back to the General Medical Clinic for follow-ups. 

When the student discount agreement goes into effect, only the urgent care center at Baptist Medical Plaza at Tamiami Trail will offer a discount to uninsured/self pay students. Students with insurance will be billed through traditional processes. Tamiami Trail will serve as the pilot location, due to its proximity for student access, and it is possible that Baptist Health's other urgent care centers will follow suit.

Representatives from FIU and Baptist Health are putting processes in place to make this happen quickly (adding systems to verify student enrollment, etc.). University Health Services will assist us in spreading the word when the agreement goes into effect.

For more information about receiving urgent care, or to review its scope of services, visit us at www.baptisthealth.net. Thank you for allowing us to provide additional information. We look forward to offering top-quality care to a top-quality university community.

Headline: Editorial: Crist sacrificing South Florida's future
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
We've all known for a while that FIU - like all other state institutions - would have to make some sacrifices this year.

The facts are simple enough: Florida's economy is down, and, between that and property tax reform, tax revenues came short of budget this year. The only logical consequence is that state agencies should have to trim their budgets.

And we've heard plenty of words to that effect since the beginning of the year: much talk about belt-tightening and trimming the fat and such.

It's only natural that FIU and public universities throughout the state should have to make some sacrifices, but when Gov. Charlie Crist presented his proposed budget cuts, he may as well have spit in FIU students' faces. 

Of 250 line items, Crist proposes cutting from the state budget, four directly involve FIU. That's twice as many cuts as any other Florida university. 

Adding salt to the wound, one of those cuts would postpone funding for FIU's School of Medicine.

Besides cutting funding for the Med School, other cuts were especially painful for FIU. 

The $4 million cut in funding for enhancements to FIU's Life Sciences program and the $550,000 cut for a Hispanic Crime Prevention program were among the cuts that are not only at the disadvantage of FIU, but  also the South Florida community it serves.

That's where Crist's cuts become downright irresponsible; when he cuts funds for programs that conduct research and training meant to solve some of South Florida's deepest social and economic problems. 

The fact that 28 percent of Crist's proposed cuts are in higher education is disconcerting enough. 

By pinching a few pennies in the wrong places today, he's risking the quality of the education that is producing the professionals of tomorrow. 

In the end, what makes Crist's proposal most confusing is that, he's cut $227 million from public universities, but kept an $80 million appropriation for a genomics institute at the private University of Miami, plus $10 million for it's medical school. 

If these cuts are to go through, the University should take the initiative to get the Med School funded because many students' future may be compromised. The University should have a alternative in place if the Legislature agrees with Crist, and passes the cuts. 

If cutting from public universities' budgets is completely reckless, simultaneously giving millions in taxpayer dollars to a private university is simply unconscionable.

Headline: Commentary: FACE-TO-FACE: Second game will be tough but not violent
Author: Luca Messina / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Despite what many will expect, this Saturday's contest between the Golden Panthers and the University of Miami Hurricanes will lack the hostility that last year brought about.

Too much is at stake for both universities, so if something were to happen, the consequences would be of epic proportions. 

With this being said, it is extremely imperative for coach Mario Cristobal to have his men focused solely on the basics, and that is clearly the game itself. 

If the squad leans towards a stance of retribution, the FIU faithful should expect not only a blowout but a lack of respect as well. 

Last year's actions already tainted the program enough that if anything close to a vengeful act were to occur, it will lower the programs reputation even more. 

For starters, FIU is currently 0-2 and winless in its last 14 contests dating back to last year. 

Only Duke's futile 22 consecutive losses stand higher in Division 1-A football. 

Obviously, the continual losses should only focus the team on the game even more. 

Miami, which is coming off a 51-13 thumping at the hands of Oklahoma, will surely be determined to win as well.

UM head coach Coach Randy Shannon is a no-nonsense, dictator type of coach similar to Cristobal. 

One can assume that to UM, this is just another game on the schedule and too much is at stake to ponder the possibilities and different ways to go about payback. 

This approach, regardless if UM is applying it or not, is what FIU must follow for their own particular desired success. 

Despite the fact that UM has lost its dominant strength of the past, the program has and always will be considered a tough opponent. 

Their five national championships are enough evidence alone. 

From a technical standpoint, the Golden Panthers have not been playing particularly well in their first two games and this is not only the result of a tough schedule. 

Too many unnecessary and unacceptable mistakes have occurred to solely blame the difficult schedule on their winless start. 

Against Penn State, the intimidation surely did play a large part but the turnovers and offensive futility is what ultimately led to the 59-0 demise. 

It was the same story against Maryland as early turnovers and insignificant offensive production led to a 26-10 loss that was surprisingly close against a team that is above average (not at the stature of Penn State, but generally always competitive).

A knowledgeable fan can certainly assume that if FIU had both a productive offense and an even average defense, they could have come away victorious against Maryland and set a new standard. 

Fixing these flaws and looking to improve upon them against UM is what truly is another important objective the team should have. Improving against top tier talent like UM will do loads for the future.

If freshman quarterback Wayne Younger can continue to flash his blessed speed and convert it into points on the scoreboard against UM's solid defense, the game could be in reach. This is surely wishful thinking as last week was just the first time that he showed his talents in game-like competition. 

Also, if the turnovers are significantly lowered, fans should expect a close one going into the fourth quarter.

Again, this is all in a best case scenario, and FIU has not given any reason to speak that highly of it. 

The game against UM surely will be interesting in the sense that it will mark the second game of what was originally dubbed a "friendly rivalry." 

The Orange Bowl in the past has always contained boisterous surroundings and both schools will have their faithful in attendance. 

Last year's game did indeed bring out good numbers and that will probably will be the case this year. The incidents of last year are over, as this has been explained over and over again, but fans will be turning up and tuning in regardless.

There is a new attitude reflected in both programs, and it will be very intriguing to see how the focus has changed and how the two teams match up on the field. 

The hoopla will obviously be there but the team's focus and translations onto the field is what truly is the most important aspect of this game.

Hopefully, by next week many will be discussing what was both a very close and respectable game on both parts.

Until then, the anticipation amounts.

&nbsp;
FIU suffered yet another loss. The Maryland Terrapins won 26-10 after taking the lead early and never looking back. FIU showed signs of improvement by holding Maryland scoreless for more then two quarters, scoring on a deep touchdown pass and at one point even cut Maryland's lead to six.

The game did not start well for FIU. After the opening kickoff was returned to the 22-yard line, the Golden Panthers went three and out. The ensuing punt was snapped high over punter Chris Cook's head and out of the end zone, which meant that FIU was assessed a safety. The safety put FIU down by two less than 30 seconds into the game.

On Maryland's first two drives, running back Keon Lattimore ran for two touchdowns and gained 80 yards on the ground, all after less then seven minutes of play. Lattimore would finish the game having rushed for 111 yards. At this point FIU trailed 16-0.

In the second quarter FIU scored their first points of the season on a 49-yard touchdown pass off a play action fake to Moses Hinton from Wayne Younger. The catch was not only FIU's first score of the season, but was also the first career touchdown for both Younger and Hinton. 

"It felt amazing," said Younger after the game. "It was obviously my first touchdown and I have been looking forward to it." 

Younger finished the game having passed for 81 yards, completing 8-of-22 passes, a touchdown and two interceptions.

FIU held Maryland scoreless for the rest of the second quarter. After giving up two touchdowns to Maryland on the first two drives FIU managed to keep them off the scoreboard until late in the game. The teams went into halftime with a score 

of  16-7 with Maryland leading FIU. 

In the third quarter FIU punter Chris Cook set a new school record by kicking a 66-yard punt that was downed at the Maryland 8-yard line. The previous record was also held by Cook who kicked a 61-yard punt last season. Ironically, that was also in a game against Maryland. The third quarter ended with FIU driving into Maryland territory and A'mod Ned making some key plays. Ned, who did not play last week against Penn. State, gained a total of 47 yards. 

The fourth quarter started on a high note for FIU as kicker Chris Abed connected on a 42-yard field goal to make the score 16-10 and put FIU within a touchdown of tying the game and a PAT away from taking the lead. On the next drive FIU forced a Maryland punt. Defensive back Lionell Singleton signaled for a fair catch, but fumbled the ball and Maryland recovered the ball at the FIU 18-yard line. 

Following their recovery of the muffed punt, Maryland made a 36-yard field goal that put them ahead 19-10. FIU went three and out on their next drive and when Maryland got the ball back they put together an 11-play drive that lasted 5:38 before ending with a punt that was fair caught by Greg Ellingson at the FIU 10-yard line.

With 3:40 remaining in the game FIU started a drive that ended after only two plays on an interception thrown by Wayne Younger. Maryland got the ball back at the FIU 14-yard line and scored after five plays on a one yard run by running back Lance Ball.

"We were encouraged by the way we came back, bounced back and made it a one score game and certainly had the opportunity to take the lead with the team only down six." coach Mario Cristobal said. "We were a couple plays short, a couple of mistakes short. We got better, but it is certainly not a moral victory."

Headline: Volleyball: Team effort leads Golden Panther in Stetson Invitational
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Behind the formidable sophomore duo of Olga Vergun and All-American Yarimar Rosa, the women's volleyball team roared its way to its first tournament title of the year at the Stetson Invitational in Deland, Fla.

Together, the two offensive juggernauts led the way in what appeared to be an easy 3-0 (30-21, 30-13, 30-21) win over the host Stetson Hatters, in what was the encore to an impressive 3-1 (38-36, 20-30, 30-28, 30-22) win over Oral Roberts.

"We talked to Olga in the preseason about stepping up in more of a leadership role and playing how we knew she could play," coach Danijela Tomic said. "She has been very consistent which is a big difference from last year when she was a freshman, but I think you see that in a lot of freshman's. She committed to playing better and it is showing early on. She has been playing really well and we are happy to see another hitter step up."

In what turned out to be the championship game, the Golden Panthers seemed to be in for a difficult match. Thanks to the aggressive play of their clutch performer, Rebecca Orzechowicz, the Hatters jumped out to a slim 14-13 lead in the opening set - awakening the Golden Panther elite. Senior Anita Szymanska had a monster kill that ignited Vergun and freshman Ines Medved, the primary targets of senior setter Keila Oliveira early on. A quick 9-4 run was enough to cripple the confidence of the hometown Hatters en route to a first set win. The explosive Rosa came to life in the second set, and blended with Vergun and Szymanska to produce much more offensive firepower than the Hatters were ready for. 

Rosa put her stamp on her third double-double of the season with 16 kills and 13 digs, and Vergun smashed an impressive 14 kills. Szymanska had 14 kills of her own on the night and was extremely productive at a scorching .650 hitting clip. 

In the earlier game against Oral Roberts, the same core of scorers led the way for the Golden Panthers. Vergun was nothing short of dominant as she wasted little time playing the Oral Robert defense to the sweet tune 22 kills and eight blocks. The always consistent Rosa was just short of a double-double with 19 kills and nine digs and Szymanska did her part with 12 kills and seven block-assists.  Oliveira handed out a team high 38 assists despite splitting maestro duties with freshman setter Natalia Valentin, who was impressive with 28 assists of her own. Being able to interchange two quality setters has been a luxury early on, according to Tomic.

"Each one of them brings something different in different situations for us. They know that we will play the best players that we feel will be the best fit against the team we are facing," Tomic said. "Natalia did a good job the first two games, and we felt that we needed to make some changes. Keila came to me and said, 'Coach, I am ready if you need me.' That's what we need from our leaders. Leaders who step up and let us know they are ready.  It has worked out really well so far." 

Danijela Novakovic had 21 kills for Oral Roberts, while Jackie Oliveira delivered a strong 20 kill-12 assist performance in defeat.

The Golden Panthers occupied three of the slots on the All-Tournament Team. Rosa earned her second such honor in as many tourneys, Szymanska, who averaged 3.71 kills per game at a .465 clip was named to the squad along with the tournament's Most Valuable Player, Vergun.

The Golden Panthers (5-2) will return home for the Alumni Match Sept. 14 at 7:30 pm at Pharmed Arena. Tomic says that the team will spend time fine tuning their skills and watching video to correct some in-game mistakes before embarking on a tough, three-game road trip in New Orleans Sept. 21-23 where they will face Louisiana-Monroe, New Orleans and Louisiana-Lafayette.

&nbsp;
Following 11 days off, the FIU Golden Panthers (0-1-1) commence their home schedule against Bringhamton Sept. 13. This game will mark the first of three consecutive home games. Head coach Thomas Chestnutt counted on the extended break to rest his players as the team will eventually play three games in the span of one week.

The Bringhamton Bearcats have played twice as many games as the Golden Panthers this season. Both teams are winless clubs and they have both recorded one tie. The Bearcats began the season with two double overtime games; therefore, the Bearcats team has been exhausted much more than the Panthers have.

The FIU defense should not have trouble keeping the Bearcat offense in check as they have not scored more than one goal the entire season. 

FIU's first and only loss of the season saw them engage in a shoot-out against the Florida Gulf Coast University. It is difficult for the Golden Panthers to keep up a consistent offensive attack because it hurt their defense. 

After the game-long offensive game, all it took was two minutes for the wasted Golden Panthers defense to give up the game-winning goal to the Eagles. 

The first home-stand of the season may improve the Golden Panthers' chances of mustering more energy on the field. Theirtie and loss came on the road.

Missed opportunities plagued the Golden Panthers this season. They were able to dominate the University of North Florida Lady Ospreys for two overtimes by running away from their defenders, but they could never finish.

Despite the winless season, Chestnutt notes the improvement the team has made game by game. His intensive practices are meant to improve the conditioning of the team. 

The Golden Panthers will have to use their stamina to outlast the Bearcats in a defensive battle if they want to win.

&nbsp;
The FIU Golden Panthers (0-3-1) dropped back-to-back games at the UConn/Adidas Classic against the University of South Florida Bulls (3-0-0) and No. 14 ranked University of Connecticut Huskies Sept. 7 and 8.

The two-game series was marked by offensive struggles and defensive prowess. Despite the Golden Panthers only allowing one goal in each game, they were not able muster a goal in either game. In four games thus far this season, FIU has scored just one goal.



USF 1, FIU 0



The Golden Panthers' great defensive performance was nullified by the team's inability to score a goal. Goalkeeper Kyle Thomas logged in six saves. The Bulls had 13 shots on goal versus the Golden Panthers' three.

Thomas allowed the game-winning shot basted from 30 yards by the Bulls' Kevon Neaves in the 36th minute of play. Senior Simon Schoendorf placed the ball at Neaves' feet to record the assist.

However, the single goal was enough to put away FIU 1-0 as the team's lack of fitness is a cause for concern according to coach Munga Eketebi. 



UCONN 1, FIU 0



The Golden Panthers could not escape the weekend sweep against the No. 14 ranked UConn club. With just nine seconds left in the match, the Huskies' Akeem Priestly launched the game-winning goal.

Goalkeeper Kyle Thomas had 25 shots fired in his direction by University of Connecticut players. Despite the 25 shots, the Golden Panthers managed to allow just one goal. Thomas recorded five saves, tallying up eleven saves for the weekend.

The Huskies were 1-for-25, but the number of opportunities gave them a chance to record the game-winning goal. The Golden Panthers shot a mere four times the entire match. 

The Golden Panthers were also outmatched 11-1 on corner kicks. The team had barely any opportunities against the Huskies, in this game.

The 1-0 victory was the Huskies' head coach Ray Ried's 150th collegiate victory.

The Golden Panthers recorded the first shot of the game, but once the Huskies' defense found a rhythm, they dominated.

In the 89th minute of play, O'Brian White passed the ball to Priestley as he cut to the middle of the box and defeated the Golden Panthers 1-0.

The team plays next against Michigan State Sept. 14 at home.

Headline: FIU-UMTeams prepare for showdown notebook:
Author: Chris Towers / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Following a painful loss to the Maryland Terrapins last saturday, the Golden Panthers face their third consecutive tough test when they travel to their home away from home and take on the University of Miami Hurricanes.

Beginning with one of the toughest early schedules in the nation has not been easy for the Golden Panthers, as they have been outscored 85-10 so far this the season, with the offense and special teams proving to be big problems.

While the Golden Panther offense has appeared anemic at times, there have been signs of life, from a beautifully executed 49-yard touchdown pass from Wayne Younger to Moses Hinton on a play action reverse, to junior A'Mod Ned comingin and ripping off a couple of moderate runs in the 3rd quarter.

Getting the offense going early will be key against a UM team that was torched for 51 points last week against the Oklahoma Sooners. The secondary, which was the best in the country as recently as 2 seasons ago, in particular was weak, allowing 6 touchdowns through the air. 

Cornerback Lionel Singleton has thus far not shown the special teams skills that made him a pre-season All American candidate, as he muffed a punt that sealed the game for the Terrapins on Saturday. Coach Mario Cristobal has said that the team will look for other options in the return game, with sophomore reciever Jeremy Dickens and running back Daunte Owens being the leading candidates.

Fortunately for the Golden Panthers, the problems on special teams appear to be mostly mental, as Singleton had a big game on the defensive side of the ball, shutting down the entire right side of Maryland's offense with key pass breakups and several nice open field tackles.

While, much of the national attention on Saturday's game will be focused on last season's brawls, Cristobal and new UM head coach Randy Shannon are going to be sure to let their players know the reprecussions for a repeat of last season's ugly mess. 

The Hurricanes have more experience at quarterback with senior Kyle Wright, Younger may be able to better his counterpart if the offensive line is able to hold back a UM defensive line that has 7 quarterback sacks already. 

Possibly the biggest key to the game will be putting pressure on the Wright. Cristobal and his coaching staff may look to stack the box early in the game to attempt to stop UM's two headed running attack featuring freshman Craig Cooper and sophomore Javarris James. If they can keep those two at bay, the secondary, which bounced back following a tough game against Penn State, should be able to do a good enough job against the Hurricane's inexperienced recieving corps.

With both teams struggling to move the ball, this should be a low scoring, physical game which should have even more drama than last season's brawl marred contest.

Headline: FootbaLL COMMENTARY: Mental lapses doom team despite offensive progress
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The bleeding may be slowing, but the wound is deep and the pain still sears the body.

The Golden Panthers delivered a valiant effort against Maryland Sept. 7, but a brutal first quarter and several questionable decisions throughout the game doomed the team, which have now gone 644 days without a victory.

The first quarter could best be described as forgettable and the team can only wish that will end up being the case. 

Giving up a safety on the first possession on a snap that nearly cleared the goal posts, the team dug themselves into yet another early hole, falling behind by 16 before even seven minutes had cleared the clock. 

Several highly questionable decisions were made in the first half, most notably wasting all three time outs in the first quarter. 

Also, there was a total lack of outside containment that led to Maryland running back Keon Lattimore scampering untouched by the front seven and tallying up 89 yards going into the second quarter.

In an almost perfect encapsulation of the program's recent struggles, a perfect pass delivered by quarterback Wayne Younger went straight through tight end Moses Hinton's hands, bounced off his helmet and landed into the hands of Maryland linebacker Adrian Moten, which would lead to a Terrapins touchdown and the 16-point deficit. 

Younger managed only one pass for positive yardage the entire first half, on a brilliantly called and executed double play action that had Hinton streaking down the sideline nearly untouched for a 49-yard touchdown reception.

Far and away the biggest question mark for the game, however, was the coaching staff's refusal to insert running back A'mod Ned for much of the game. 

When Ned entered the game late in the first half cutting and dicing on his first carry of the season, a collective gasp could be heard from every Maryland reporter in the press box.

 It wasn't until the third quarter that Ned saw action, averaging 5.3 yards per carry and showing a pulse that's been missing from the running attack as of yet.

As any casual observer can point out that the decapitating blow to the Golden Panthers was once again self-inflicted, as kick returner Lionell Singleton coughed up his fourth fumble of the season. 

That turned what should have been the start of an FIU drive with a six-point deficit into a Maryland field goal and a nine-point Terrapin lead. 

Though it is almost mundane to draw positives when a team has gone so long without a victory, some noticeable improvements were seen from the second quarter on. 

Pressure was continually applied to Maryland quarterback Jordan Steffy, and only 82 more yards were allowed on the ground after the explosion in the first quarter. 

The team seems to have found its place kicker in freshmen Chris Abed, converting both a 42-yard field goal and an extra point, seemingly pedestrian to many but a remarkable improvement for this desperate special teams squad. 

The Golden Panthers will prepare for the most anticipated game of the season against the University of Miami in a game where they must erase the events that transpired last year from their memories. 

The Hurricanes will be look to start where they left off last season, but FIU demonstrated that they can hang with a big ACC school and, for that matter, one that shows much less discrepancy from the Hurricane squad than in former years. 

A healthy 12,201 fans attended the game, but the hallowed stadium felt like a mere shell of itself. 

The team can continue to improve every game, but until the average fan begins seeing victories, be it against an ACC power or Division 1-A cellar dweller, the team will fall under the curse of all Miami based teams and trudge on without the relevance or income the program so desperately desires.

Headline: University unfazed by cuts
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Despite proposed budget cuts by Gov. Charlie Crist, FIU is proceeding with its plans to open the new College of Medicine by 2009. 

John Rock, dean of the College of Medicine, along with other top FIU administrators, believe that the Legislature will not reverse itself by cutting funds for the medical school.

"I think Gov. Crist is fulfilling his judiciary responsibility to the citizens of the state of Florida," Rock said. "These are simply his suggestions for reducing the budget.  But respectfully we disagree with the governor's assessment." 

When asked about the University's other alternatives if the Legislature does agree to the proposed cuts, Rock said he believed that all would go on as scheduled.

 "I don't discuss hypothetical [situations]," Rock said. "We are confident that the Legislature will, in fact, keep its commitment to the citizens of South Florida."

Rock also said that any discussions at the state level on reductions in higher education should not affect students considering FIU's College of Medicine.

"I think it's premature to have any judgement on how this would affect the students because we're in an accredation cycle," to allow us to consider students for admission in the year '09," Rock said. "Our medical school must first get put on an accreditation from the [Liason Committee for Medical Education], then, once we have that accreditation, we're allowed to recruit our students."

If approved by the Legislature, FIU's College of Medicine is slotted to lose $5.4 million - the money to be allocated to pay the salaries of the faculty already hired for the College of Medicine, the administrators and staff.

Pre-med student Carolina Veronese has been planning to attend the College of Medicine for the last four years. She was angry after learning about the proposed cuts to medical schools she considers affordable. 

"It's not only the money, but the idea of the medical school serving minorities and under-represented groups," Veronese said. "Not many medical schools are minority-oriented and as a minority I feel it's very important."

While the administration maintains its confidence in the Legislature, the Student Government Association is preparing to rally in Tallahassee Sept. 20. 

The rally will be free and open to all FIU students, according to Viviana Jordan, director of legislative affairs for SGA. 

"We want to get students out there as soon as possible," Jordan said. 

Busses will leave from the University Park campus Sept. 19 at 10 p.m. and arrive in Tallahassee the next morning.

Breakfast and refreshments will be provided by SGA, Jordain said.

The rally will start at noon and end at 1 p.m. 

"It's going to be short, sweet and to the point," Jordan said. 

To participate in the rally, students must sign up in the SGA office located in the Graham Center, room 211, by Sept. 18 at 5 p.m.

SGA will not limit the number of students who can attend to the rally. Anyone interested will be allowed to attend.

"I'm hoping to have a great amount of student support," said SGA Vice-President Arthur "AJ" Meyer. "The rally will give students an experience they might not have [otherwise]."

Students will return to FIU at approximately 10 p.m., according to Jordan. 

Breakfast will be provided the morning of the rally and lunch and refreshments will be provided on the return trip. 

SGA is also inviting Gov. Crist to attend the rally in an attempt to show him that SGA is not the only one concerned about his proposed cuts, but the entire student body as well, Meyer said.  

Talks are also underway with the University of Central Florida in attempts to have its students join in on the rally. 

UCF's medical school funding was also among the proposed cuts. 

"We want a strong presence in the capital that tells the governor FIU students fully support the medical school," Jordan said. "And to remind the Legislature that we know that they will be supporting us in securing the funding that is necessary."

Headline: High math failure rate under investigation
Author: María José Concha / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Not many students can claim College algebra as their favorite class - not with an estimated failure rate of 70 percent.

Pre-med student Caréa Robinson is one of them; she had to take the course twice before passing and says the professors are to blame.

"I don't think my professors were lenient - they didn't have homework to help improve your grade or extra-credit and the office hours weren't useful because I had other classes during their office hours," Robinson said. "One teacher would come in [at the beginning of class], write everything on the board and then she would explain it by whispering and you couldn't understand anything."

Julian Edward, chairman of the Mathematics Department, said there is no single cause for such a high number in college algebra failures. 

He says one reason might be that high schools don't require students to take math courses their junior and senior years. 

As a result, such students enter their freshman year of college without the necessary math skills needed to pass college algebra.

Brian Peterson, associate professor for the History Department, has been involved in educational policy analysis since 1978 and has a strong, continuing interest in FIU's lower-division program, which he had advocated for. 

Peterson said he has been told by math department faculty members that their adjunct instructors are not effective teachers.

 Unfortunately, Peterson said, the department cannot hire better adjuncts for the amount of money that the central administration gives them.

"Good math instructors are hard to find in Miami - especially at the adjunct pay rate of around $2500 per course," Peterson said. "The math department tells me that the situation is getting better because they have added some new, permanent, full-time instructors who are effective teachers."

The math department is offering over 50 sections this Fall, including some special sections of college algebra that meet six hours per week. 

There is a pre-algebra course that students can take to familiarize themselves with the concepts covered in college algebra.

Also, the department offers tutoring in Deuxieme Maison, room 409A. 

The math department hopes to relocate its tutoring center to a larger facility in the Green Library sometime this Fall, according to Edward.

For students who work or do not have time for tutoring, there is an online service available at the departmental Web site.

Edward believes students can help solve this problem by completing six hours or more of college algebra homework in the online tutoring program, but it all depends on their math skills.  

He said that doing the tutorials will have a significant impact in their performance in the class.

"Math is something you learn by doing, not seeing," Edward said.

Edward also believes students need to be careful when choosing their math courses because many people make the error of taking college algebra when it is not required in their majors. 

For non-science and non-business majors, Edward suggests that students take finite or social choice math.

"Don't fall into the false impression that this course will be easier due to the familiarity with the material from high school," Edward said. "We cannot leave any topics off because the syllabus is state-mandated."

Here are just a few of the different newsletters and magazines that students can find:

Gulf Stream Literary Magazine   

Published by FIU's Creative Writing Program and geared toward graduate students, Gulf Stream Magazine contains numerous stories, both fiction and nonfiction, from both rising and established writers. 

Poetry and photography are also featured in the magazine. 

According to Fiction Editor Joe Clifford, the magazine serves two purposes: it lets writers get a taste of the editing world and gives them a channel for their voices, which is often difficult for beginning writers.

"I feel that Gulf Stream, at least since I've been involved, has provided a home to many pieces that might have otherwise gone homeless," Clifford said.

The magazine is normally published twice a year, but this year, budget constraints have limited the periodical to only publication. The release date of the issue has yet to be announced.

For more information on how to write for the magazine or otherwise become involved, visit GulfStreamlitmag.com

Honors Web

Honors Web, one of two FIU Honors College newsletters, has published two issues this year encompassing different topics in the lives of Honors College students.

The young online newsletter will soon include a discussion forum and will incorporate more videos and other visuals, according to Juan Lopez, the coordinator of information technology services and one of the newsletter's advisors,

"Eventually, we hope to have discussions online because sometimes you walk out of honors class and you weren't able to say everything you wanted," Lopez said.

The newsletter is currently recruiting writers. For more information go to thc.fiu.edu/honorsweb,

The Speakeasies

Based out of the Biscayne Bay Campus, The Speakeasies is an upcoming literary magazine geared toward undergraduate students. It will showcase the works of aspiring writers and students.

According to Alexandra McAnarney, editor-in-chief, the magazine has encountered many obstacles and has yet to publish its inaugural issue. 

"There are no funds, only big dreams - mostly broken ego," she said. "350 copies would come out to about $1000."

The Speakeasies is still active by having poetry readings at the Amate Tea Lounge, 811 Northeast 79 Street.

FIU Magazine

This magazine, published quarterly, highlights various University events such as the FIU Torch Awards and profiles prominent alumni making impacts in the community. 

According to Deborah O'Neil, FIU Magazine Editor, the magazine's circulation is more than 120,000, which includes members of both the Alumni Association and the Student Alumni Association. Stories are written by professional writers, including some who have written for the Washington Post and National Public Radio, Free issues are available throughout the Graham Center and Primera Casa.

NATIONAL:

Congress passes financial aid bill

In the wake of budget cuts and looming tuition hikes, there is a silver lining for students. 

The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed on the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, a bill that promises to grant additional aid for low-income students and help students repay their debts.  

President Bush has said he will sign the bill, which was passed on Sept. 7, into law. 

Lowering subsidies to private banks will pay for the bill instead of passing the money on to students. This will create no additional costs for taxpayers. Instead, lenders will receive a reduced rate of return for offering federal student loans and a slightly reduced reinsurance rate from the federal government.

The new act will help low-income students by increasing the amount offered in Pell Grants. The maximum amount, currently at $4,310, will be increased over the next four years by $1,090. The grant will first increase by $490 over the next two school years and by $690 the following two school years. Currently, 5 million low-income students receive Pell Grants.

The act will also create an Income Based Repayment program that will allow indebted students to repay their loans as a percentage of their income. Interest rates will also be reduced for students receiving subsidized Stafford loans.

Headline: Golden Panthers offense falters in inter-city rematch
Author: Christopher Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A reunion took place Saturday afternoon September 15, in the Orange Bowl as former UM National Championship teammates Mario Cristobal and Randy Shannon stood apart on opposite sidelines as Cristobal's FIU team took on Shannon's UM squad in a rematch of last year's 35-0 UM victory.

Once the opening kickoff happened, though, they were back to being opponents, as the Hurricanes defeated the Golden Panthers 23-9. 

Although a fleeting feeling of delight surely ran through the coaches upon avoiding a rehash of last year's infamous brawl, it was dissipated by the penalties and sloppy play from both team's performances. 

The game started off with an interception by FIU quarterback Wayne Younger who, despite throwing another pick in the second quarter, is beginning to show his speed talents, adding another dimension to the attack with his effective scrambling ability and setting a school record for quarterback rushing yards with 67.

UM quarterback Kyle Wright followed Younger's interception with a pick of his own, as cornerback Anthony Gaitor picked off Wright's pass on the following drive.

In the beginning, it seemed as though the game would be a defensive struggle, marked by both team's struggling offenses, and at least one of those offenses lived up to their billing.

The story of the game, and the FIU season up to this point, is the inability of the Golden Panther offense to stay on the field and give the defense a chance to recuperate.

The defense held their own throughout the game, creating three turnovers and limiting the Hurricanes to 23 points, a significant achievement given that the UM offense started numerous drives within Golden Panther territory.

FIU was in the game for much of the first 35 minutes, as they were down by just 10 points at halftime, before allowing the Hurricanes to pull away in the third.

The Golden Panthers had a great chance to score early in the third as Wright put the ball on the ground and FIU scooped it up at UM's 20 yard line. However, the team was unable to punch it in, and had to settle for a field goal, making it 13-3 instead of 13-7.

The play that effectively drove the stake into the Golden Panthers' heart was an 80 yard touchdown reception to Lance Leggett that put the Cane's ahead 23-3 with just over 2 minutes to go in the third quarter. 

Penalties abounded for both teams, most notably a holding call that negated a fourth down conversion for FIU that would have given them a new set of downs in the Hurricanes red zone.

"[The penalties] truly hurt us and put us in bad situations, as they always do," said coach Cristobal.

All was not lost for the offense however, as junior running back A'mod Ned continues to assert himself as the centerpiece of the rushing game. Although rushing for a seemingly average 87 yards, much of it was done with an overmatched offensive line. That often resulted in Ned having to pick up yards after being hit 2 yards in the backfield and showing striking ability in simply getting back to the line of scrimmage.

Ned also turned in a 22 yard run in the second quarter, the longest ground pickup this season.

"We're getting better and better," says A'mod. "But we're not where we need to be.

	The Golden Panther's lone touchdown came from a double play action pass that Trenard Turner took 65 yards to the house, bringing the score to 23-9, but by then it was too little, too late. 

That specific play has been extremely successful thus far this season, as both times it has been used it has led to six points on the board.

The day's finest performer may have been punter Chris Cook, who twice pinned Miami at their own 1 yard line with kicks going out of bounds inches outside the end zone. He averaged 40.5 yards per punt, a marked improvement over last year's punting squad, which averaged less than 35 yards per punt last season.

"What a spectacular job by him," said Cristobal. "He's going to do a great job for us the rest of year."

This second meeting will be the last time that the teams face off for the foreseeable future, as there are currently no other games scheduled for the series.

The game also marked the first time in Division 1 history that two teams simultaneously played on their respective home fields, as the Golden Panthers call the Orange Bowl home this year while the Hurricanes have been doing so since 1937.

After the game, Cristobal met with his Shannon at midfield and the former teammates shared a hug. Despite the loss, Cristobal remained encouraged and made no secret of his intentions with the program.

"We're going to be a national championship team one day. We're just not there yet. Got to keep working hard," he said.
