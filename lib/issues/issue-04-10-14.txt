Headline: Final score does not justify football game
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The scoreboard at Homer Bryce Stadium lit up a 31-24 victory for the Golden Panthers over No. 5 Stephen F. Austin on Saturday Oct. 9. It wasn't that close. The seven-point margin doesn't do justice to FIU's performance in Nacogdoches, TX.

FIU tainted the Lumberjacks spotless 4-0 start and snapped their five-game home win streak in dominating fashion, piling up 434 total yards of offense and leading by as much as 21 points after three quarters. 

The Golden Panthers had yet to win a game against a ranked Division I-AA team in six previous tries and lucky number seven was by no means a guarantee. 

The Lumberjacks had already defeated No. 13 Northern Arizona and No.7 Northern Iowa this season. Despite the loss, they look like a team well on their way to a sixth consecutive winning season under Head Coach Mike Santiago. 

What we've learned after three games is that when this Golden Panther team plays to its potential and cuts back on mistakes and penalties, there isn't a team on its schedule it can't beat.

It's difficult to single out just one or two players after a win like this, but when Rashod Smith runs like a man possessed, hoarding up 199 yards and 3 touchdowns, FIU will have a chance to win. 

When Cory Mckinney and Samuel Smith are making plays and getting involved early and often, points will come in bunches. 

When the offensive line is keeping Josh Padrick's jersey clean and opening lanes for Rashod Smith, the FIU offense is as electrifying as any in Division I-A football. 

None of this was a surprise. FIU's offense has never been a major concern. The unit is averaging 414 yards and 29 points per game this season. 

It's the defense that fans look at with that show-me-something fold of the arms. That's where the acquisition of defensive coordinator, Bernard "Tiger' Clark", is paying off.

While far from perfect, FIU's defense did a great job of making SFA quarterback Michael Williams a non-factor throughout most of the game.

 SFA half back Derek Farmer, a transfer who led Texas A&M in rushing yards the last two consecutive seasons and is being considered for this year's Payton award, was held to 38 yards on 12 carries and kept out of the end-zone.  

The only thing tainting an otherwise great defensive performance is the three would-be interceptions FIU dropped, two of which resulted in touchdowns. 

Had those been made, the game would have been a blowout. But maybe that's asking a bit much. The win is defiantly enough.

What's not to be content about when FIU registered its second consecutive road win against a team that doesn't ordinarily lose at home? 

This was one of the most challenging schools on FIU's schedule. The team's progress is evident. With the Golden Panthers headed to Louisiana-Monroe this weekend, FIU may be a favorite on the road for the very first time.

Headline: Running back carries ball 37 times in victory
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU went into the game against Stephen F. Austin with the idea of stopping the run. Last season the Lumberjacks rushed for 337 yards dominating the Golden Panthers 35-13. 

Things reversed this season however, as SFA was kept under 100 yards and FIU rushed for 218, with 199 of those yards belonging to senior halfback Rashod Smith. 

With heavy rain falling down for most of the game, Coach Don Strock kept the ball on the ground, something that surprised the Lumberjacks defense that expected the Golden Panthers to come out throwing the ball.

Smith carried the ball a career high 37 times leading FIU to its second win of the season in three games. Smith carried the load for FIU scoring three touchdowns including an impressive 56-yard run early in the second quarter. 

After a two-hour practice on Monday that included lots of running, Smith took time off to sit down with The Beacon and discuss Saturday's game.

Q: How big was it for you to establish the run, something SFA was supposed to do on you guys?

It was real big because if you run you open up the pass, it gets the running game going which makes it all good for the offense.

Q: What type of things did Coach Don Strock tell you before and after the game?

Before he told us that they couldn't stop us on offense or defense and if we go out and execute, they won't stop us. After the game he told me good game but I don't think he even knew I got the ball that many times.

Q: How much credit do you give to your offensive line for creating holes throughout the game?

I love it; they blocked their butts off. Without them, I can't rush that much, they deserve all the credit.

Q: What type of confidence level does the team have now, especially after winning two games on the road, something the team couldn't do the first two years of the program?

We have a high [level] of confidence because we have two road victories. Our whole team is getting together and we just don't give up. If something fails we keep playing because good things will happen.

Q: What did you do the following day after the game and how sore did you feel?

I laid down and went to sleep when we got home and later woke up and got in the pool to relax. I was sore and I'm still sore now but we still have to practice and keep getting sore.

Subheadline: Team holds on to win first game against a ranked football team
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers traveled to Homer Bryce Stadium in hopes of picking up its second win of the season and first in school history against a ranked opponent-the team did just that as FIU was able to hold on and defeat Stephen F. Austin 31-24 on Oct. 9.

Rashod Smith led the Golden Panthers attack with a career high 37 carries for 199 yards against the Lumberjacks, a team that came in with four wins in as many games this season.

FIU dominated the first three quarters of the game and entered fourth leading 31-10. The Lumberjacks got on the scoreboard early in the fourth on a 24-yard pass from Mike Williams to Miguel Toulon captivating an 11-play 95-yard drive. 

After being stopped by the SFA defense, FIU once again faced another long drive by the Lumberjacks. Louie Runnels scored a touchdown on a four-yard run as SFA drove the ball 63 yards in a span of just over two minutes to put the score 31-24.  

SFA would not get closer than seven and managed to lose its first game of the season and fall to 4-1. The victory meant FIU defeated an opponent ranked No. 5 in the nation in Division I-AA.

Head Coach Don Strock was pleased with the way his team came out and won on the road for the second time this season.

"Obviously when you go on the road and you play a team ranked fifth in the country in I-AA in the third game [of the season], it proves to them that they can win on the road again, and play with teams that are highly ranked," said Strock of his team who improved to 2-1 on the season.

The Golden Panthers got on the scoreboard first as Smith ran a 1-yard touchdown run with just under six minutes left in the first quarter. 

 FIU used 5:56 minutes on the drive, the most time consuming in the game.

After a 23-yard field goal by Ryan Rossner of SFA, Smith exploded through the right side stiff-arming two defenders along the way for a 56-yard run, putting FIU up 14-3. With 1:58 left in the first half, Adam Moss kicked his longest field goal of the season, good for 45 yards, adding three points to FIU's score.

FIU however, would go up by double digits as Williams threw a 38-yard pass to Tong Tompkis on an 80-yard drive that took only 1:09 minutes.

FIU opened the second half strong scoring 14 unanswered points. Cory McKinney scored the first touchdown on an 8-yard pass from Josh Padrick. Smith followed by scoring his third touchdown of the game giving FIU a 31-10 lead.

FIU went into the fourth quarter with  a comfortable 21-point lead but the nationally ranked Lumberjacks finished close losing by only seven points.

Smith enjoyed the win after the game and praised the checks and balances between the running game and the passing game.

"It was real important because when you get the ground game going it opens up the pass, and we want to be an all around offense," Smith said.

Padrick gave credit to the coaching staff for laying out a terrific game plan for the game.

"The coaching put us in the best positions and the defense did a great job. Rashod did a great job running the ball by running great routes," Padrick said.

Last season, FIU was dominated by SFA as the team defeated them 35-13. The difference this season was the growth of the team.

"We're a different team we've grown up a bunch. This year we have gotten bigger and faster and we got Coach Clark who makes a big difference," said Haritan who is happy to have the knowledge of NFL and former Hurricane Bernard "Tiger" Clark coaching the defense.

Added linebacker and captain Lance Preston, "I give a lot of props to coach Clark coming in and changing things around. Even the way we practice is different and it showed during the game."

Another reason why the Lumberjacks looked puzzled on defense was because FIU's reputation as a throwing team and struggles that team had running the ball  against SFA last year.

"They might have been real surprised, because the last year and this year we've been throwing the ball a lot. That's the bread and butter of our team but when you have a running back it opens up the defense," Padrick said.

Haritan saw the SFA team was more laid back and unprepared for what FIU had to offer.

"I think they expected to come in and run away with the game. I think they expected it to be a lot like it was last year and they just didn't know they were meeting with a different ball team," Haritan said.

A few faculty members traveled with the team, including Dr. Paul Gallagher who was excited with the performance of the Golden Panthers.

"I think they are awesome. Obviously they are older and more matured. The coaching is real fine tuned and has brought the young man along plus I think they have the confidence," said Gallagher. "When you go out and beat the fourth best team in the nation in I-AA which can beat many I-A teams around the country you know you're beginning to arrive and with the exception of a fluke last week, we would be 3-0 right now."

The Golden Panthers will play their next game away at Malone Stadium against Sun Belt Conference opponent Louisiana-Monroe on Oct. 16.

&nbsp;
It was another tough weekend for the Golden Panthers volleyball team as it suffered 3-1 defeats to two conference foes, Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee State. 

The two losses, dropped its record to 1-14 (0-5, Sun Belt), adding to the woes the young team has encountered this season.

The first match versus Western Kentucky, on Oct. 8, 2004 at Pharmed Arena, was a hard fought battle where little mistakes turned costly for FIU. 

Junior Laura Vogel led the way with a valiant effort putting up a career high 15 kills and committing just two errors. Freshman Ruth Fleming added 13 kills and 13 digs to the effort. 

Junior Anna Dmowska also had 13 kills and freshman Alyse Santisi contributed with 17 digs.

In game one Western Kentucky took a late lead and practically never looked back in a 30-22 win as FIU managed six ties, but could not manage to take the lead. 

At one point in game two, FIU was down 27-22. A mini rally brought the team to within one at 27-26, but FIU was not able squeeze out any more magic as the Toppers finally put the game away 30-27. 

FIU won game three 30-26, but it was not just any victory for FIU, they were the first Sun Belt team to win a game against the Lady Toppers this season. In the game Santisi recorded another seven digs. 

FIU lost game four 30-19 after committing a game high 11 errors. In the entire match, the Golden Panthers committed a total of 32 errors. On the other hand, Western Kentucky committed 23.

The second match, on  Oct. 12, 2004 at Pharmed Arena, was more of the same for FIU as mistakes continued to cost the team. FIU committed 31 errors in the match. On the positive, Anna Dmowska continued her strong play recording an outstanding 19 kills and Alyse Santisi had 17 digs for her second game in a row. Sophomore Oksana Zabalueva also contributed with a solid 11 kills. 

In game one, MTSU took an early 7-0 lead as FIU never got close in the 30-19 victory. 

Game two had similar circumstances as the Blue Raiders again took an early lead and turned it into a 30-20 defeat. In the game, Zabalueva contributed with four kills. 

In game three, the most exciting game of the match, FIU  came back from a late 23-17, tied the game at 28, and eventually won 32-30. 

Freshman Dyionna Smith had 16 assists and added to the late rally with 4 straight points on her serve along with another 3 points from the serve of Jessica Jones. 

In the final game, FIU seemed to be running on fumes as they were quickly down 14-2. The Blue Raiders dominated the game with a 30-14 final score.

The Golden Panthers have lost nine straight games. The team's next game will be away on Oct. 14 against Louisiana Lafayette.

Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers came into the Oct. 8 game at FIU Soccer Field in an effort to get back to .500 and pick up its second conference win of the season. 

The team was able to do just that as Oneonta State proved to be no match for the quicker and better FIU squad. 

With a 2-1 victory, the Golden Panthers improved to 4-4-0 overall and 2-0-0 in the conference, while the Red Dragons lost their third consecutive game and dropped to 4-7-0 overall and 0-1-0 in ASC play.

FIU dominated and controlled the game throughout, out shooting the Red Dragons 12-3 in the first half and 18-7 overall. The final score however, did not validate FIU's complete command of the game. 

"It is difficult to play against a team that's just trying to prevent you from playing," Head Coach Karl Kremser commented.

Although the Golden Panthers scored first in the 10th minute of the match with Carron Williams' difficult header from Lucas Scudeler and Edgard Correa, they finished with only two goals and a final score of 2-1. 

"That's a team [OSU] we should beat by three, four goals easily," Kremser said.

The story of the game however, was the extremely physical and at times dirty play of the Red Dragons and the many missed opportunities for the Golden Panthers. 

The match included twenty-six called fouls and a total of four yellow cards. 

"With officiating, you're always going to be unhappy," said Kremser of the high number of foul calls.

After taking a 2-0 lead on Scudeler's goal in the 60th minute - which came on a free kick and was assisted by Correa, tempers began to flare and the play got more physical and intense. 

"They were trying to minimize what we can do," said Kremser of OSU who were playing the game in order to stop FIU but not necessarily trying to defeat them.

Following several altercations between opposing players, OSU got on the scoreboard in the 81st minute, when Miami native Chris Spence of North Miami Beach knocked in a penalty kick past FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe who played all 90 minutes and finished with four saves.

Despite a lackluster second half performance by the Golden Panthers defense, the team held on to the lead and prevailed to pick up a conference win.

"We didn't have the intensity in the second half that we had earlier. We've got to finish," Coach Kremser commented on his displeasure at the team's poor second half performance.

At one point of the second half, FIU played so poorly that the fans chanted and pleaded for substitutions and the return of the starting lineup. 

"We tried to give everyone an opportunity to play and it almost backfired," added Kremser.

The team will now hit the road for a three game road trip before returning to Miami for the FIU Invitational, which will take place Oct. 29 and Oct. 30.

Headline: College political leaders face off on second debate
Subheadline: Bush could not admit to mistakes made
Author: James Valle / FIU College Democrats President
&nbsp;
Once again, John Kerry demonstrated his mastery of the issues and showed the leadership qualities which George Bush clearly lacks. 			     Throughout the town hall style debate last Friday night, Kerry remained composed and level headed throughout the entire 90-minute debate, while George Bush showed his annoyance and became flustered in the face of difficult questions.

There were two telling moments in the debate. The first occurred when Bush flew out of his stool and charged towards moderator Charlie Gibson like a bat out of hell. 

He showed a complete lack of respect for the rules (no surprise there), and spoke over Gibson simply because he "had to respond" to Kerry's assertion that the Coalition of the Willing isn't a real coalition.  

The fact is that Kerry is absolutely right.  Although he cannot openly state it for political purposes, this coalition is a complete farce. As Americans, we have sustained 90 percent of both coalition casualties and cost.  

Of the 30 members of the coalition, only the U.S. and Britain have sent more than 2,000 troops. 

Do Costa Rica, Iceland or Afghanistan (coalition members) even have armies? Oh, that's right - we are Afghanistan's army! 

That's a good way to add countries to your coalition; just invade and conquer them! It's another bright decision by the Bush administration.

The second debate highlight came when Bush was asked to name three mistakes he made in the past four years.

This man had the gall to insist that his only mistake was making some judicial appointments with bad judgment. Bush could have provided a humorous answer by saying, "Well, eating that pretzel without washing it down properly was a pretty big mistake." 

Instead, he came up lame, as always, and wanted the American people to believe he was perfect and holy. 

 I'll summarize some of his mistakes for him: Rushing to war without a plan to win the peace, cutting taxes that provides that top one percent with an average of $79,000 while the middle 20 percent get $1,000, allowing five million people to lose health insurance, under funding No Child Left Behind by $27 billion, being the first president since Herbert Hoover to have a net job loss. I can go on, but I think you get the picture.

On Nov. 2, this country will make a change and we will elect the next president of the United States, Sen. John Kerry. Kerry will reverse the regressive policies of the Bush White House. 

It's up to you to let your voice be heard and you can do that starting Oct. 18 when early voting opens. As students, we have the most up for grabs this election. In the past four years, only three out of every 10 college graduates found jobs upon graduating. This is unacceptable, and we can and we will do better.

Subheadline: Kerry lived up to "flip flopper" title
Author: Juan F. D’Arce, Jr. / FIU College Republicans President
&nbsp;
The second Presidential debate was very encouraging for both candidates as it provided enough questions for Senator Kerry to flip-flop and for President Bush to showcase why he is our Commander-in-Chief. The truth was placed on the table and even though President Bush was not a debate team member, his message was clear, as well as timely.

Senator Kerry spoke about his plan to stop outsourcing. He spoke about bringing more jobs to the U.S., as well as stopping production of goods and jobs that are sent abroad. The fact is, when you stop outsourcing and bring those jobs back to the U.S., you increase the cost of the product being manufactured. That means that the price for many products in the U.S. will be increased. Many U.S. produced goods are already heavily taxed abroad and the added cost of bringing back jobs to the U.S. would make our products impossible to sell. 

In addition, this will make products and services too costly for the middle class and those at or below poverty levels.    

Furthermore, minimum wage will probably have to be raised, thus pushing  pricing on goods and services up to cover the wage increase. This would make us pay more for everything and definitely not enough to cover the gap that outsourcing would create.  

Senator Kerry kept talking about the war in Iraq, arguing that President Bush made a mistake and lied to the people of the U.S.. That the president should have known better. 

This seems more than hypocritical and almost hard to believe because he voted on the issue as did Senator Rodham Clinton. They both had the same intelligence information that President Bush had. It seemed as if Senator Kerry sees the Iraq issue as his meal ticket and will continue to push it on his wishy-washy attempts to be president.

Here is a reality check; you cannot be the Commander-in-Chief of this great nation when you call the war in Iraq a mistake.  It is sad that Senator Kerry calls this "the wrong war at the wrong time."

You are right, Senator  Kerry, it would sure be great to live in a country country where terrorism happens on a daily basis and nothing can be done to stop or contain it.

I guess Senator Kerry plans to stop terrorism and the war in Iraq with the help of his allies. Exactly which countries  from this coalition hold our best interest in foreign policy? Will Castro, Ortega, Arafat, Chavez and Kim Jong Ill be joining Kerry for our best interest?

On the issue of taxes, I want to know how Senator Kerry plans to pay for all the programs he aims at creating without raising taxes on everyone. He aims at creating more programs and salaries to alleviate the problems that many of these programs already created. Who is guarding whom here?

Lastly, I want to touch up on Senator Kerry's voting style. How do you vote "Yes" and then "No" as well as miss important votes that affect all Americans? I always thought that "No" meant "No." 

I am sorry Senator Kerry, flip-flops are allowed in most places, but they are not permitted in the White House.

As Election Day draws near, the media has been unflinchingly focusing on just a mere handful of issues: the mud slinging between the two candidates, tarnished war records and even overplayed references to their college years.

Although the Iraqi War has itself found high prominence as an election issue, other controversial topics dealing with the conflict have been hardly mentioned. The report by U.S. chief weapon's inspector Charles Duelfer, which proved that Saddam Hussein had not amassed weapons of mass destruction as assured by the Bush administration, was briefly spotlighted by the media before being trumped as second-rate news.

Other issues which should be receiving equal billing-issues that in the past have decided the outcomes of whole elections-have been hardly addressed. Among these are the growing controversies surrounding stem cell research, environmental issues and our relationships with countries not found in either Europe or the Middle East.

The media, traditionally seen as the watchdogs of society, have traded their respectability and become cultural show dogs, parading stories that will garner ratings more than truth. As a source of information, we need to open our resources to all issues and events, giving the public at large the chance to decide on its own which story is of utmost importance.

Headline: Second bananas take spotlight, bicker
Author: Danny Muela / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Like last week's presidential debate, the candidates for vice president bickered over trivial things, took pot shots at one another and  tried to make their opponent look like an incompetent fool. 

In other words, they acted as if they had just landed a spot on the Real World. 

These debates really need something new and refreshing or the American public is just going to tune them out and focus on something more important, like Poland.                	

For instance, the whole introduction part of the debate is not very ceremonial. We want to see some drama! I think the debates could learn a lesson from another forum of heated competition: professional wrestling. Nothing really stirs up emotion like a grand entrance accompanied by blasting music that really suits the person's character. 

Maybe Vice President Cheney could have strolled into the room with the "Imperial March" from "Star Wars," maybe that heavy breathing effect from Darth Vadar could be incorporated. It would really have set the mood. 

You could also have Senator Edwards hop on down the stage to Lynard Skynard's "Sweet Home Alabama" or something to that effect. Just by adding these we could really have our candidates pumped up and ready to smash some skulls. 

All I really want to see is Colin Powell come down an aisle with the theme from "Shaft" playing, but I've heard he's more a SuperFly guy anyway.

But, let's get back to the actual debate. After the debate we saw more of the same mindless praise for candidates from their respective parties. But, unlike the first presidential debate where Senator Kerry seemed to rock the house so to speak, the vice presidential debates were actually more of a tie. Both candidates really seemed qualified and prepared. And both got in really good lines, not sound bytes, but actual lines. 

Cheney's best attack was when he declared that despite Senator Edwards many years of service in the senate, he had missed so many meetings and votes that Cheney had never met the senator in person till they sat down for this debate. Even though this statement has been shown to be false by reports showing that Senator Kerry and Vice President Cheney have indeed met twice before the vice presidential debate, it was still a very effective attack on Edwards.

 As for Senator Edwards, nothing else showed how much brass he had, as when he looked Vice President Cheney in the eye and told him that this country couldn't take another four years of the current administration. Strong words and I don't know about you, but Cheney really scares me. So for anyone to just look him in the face and tell him that without wetting himself is brave man in my book.

   In this debate, we also got to hear something that hasn't been focused on the campaign trial: our own country's problems.      

That's right, they actually spoke about America for a change. They touched on topics such as Medicare, education, social security, the economy and the ever-popular gay marriage issue. 

This was a very interesting discussion to watch. As most know, the vice president's daughter is gay. You could see it in his face that he was a bit uncomfortable talking about gay marriage. The interesting part is that even though Cheney agrees that marriage shouldn't be regulated, he ultimately said that he had to stand behind the president, who in fact wants to regulate marriage. Of course you can't have the president and vice president disagree on such a hot topic so close to the election, but this shows how even Cheney can be limited by the fact that he's only second banana. Which is odd, considering that Cheney appeared just a bit more prestigious than his boss.

This debate might have been more of the same and it may have been very close, but the fact remains that facts are being thrown out the window. By checking an independently run web site by the University of Pennsylvania called www.factcheck.org. One can see that both Edwards and Cheney got their facts mixed up. 

The winner of last night's fact skewing award goes to Vice President Cheney. The figures and statements that both candidates presented could be argued upon, but Cheney really seemed to spin numbers from the casualty rate to the number of times Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted in the Senate.  

Even though the candidates did well on the debate, they really need to get their facts straight. The public needs to become better informed so that when a statement is handed down, the public can call them on it being either true or false.

 But hey, it was still a pretty good debate. Maybe it would have been better if both candidates would have just lost it and challenged one another to a cage match on PAY-PER-VIEW, but beggars can't be choosers. Senator Edwards really had a tougher job here than his running mate, but he really showed America what he could do. And of course Vice President Cheney did what he was expected to do, scare small children yet really make a good argument for himself and his less-than-stellar boss. 

This election is really going to be close, there's no question about that. The only question that remains is if the American public can really get up and find the facts to maybe broaden this gap a bit. 

And make sure to keep watching to see if the candidates can keep their game faces on, or face getting kicked off the island. I know I'll be watching, but mostly because I have this idea that Senator Kerry appears to be slowly melting, and I want to see if that comes into play, but I guess everyone has his own reasons.

Headline: Lawyers queue up around nation in preparation for Election Day challenges
Author: By John McCormick / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
In a cramped corner of the state Democratic Party headquarters here, David Sullivan and seven other full-time volunteers are franticly dialing lawyers to ask them to monitor Election Day polling places.

At a union office across town, another Democratic attorney is helping design a form for use outside Ohio polls that will record the identities of voters prevented from successfully casting a ballot on Nov. 2.

And in a cozy law office near Ohio State University there was last-minute research under way as lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit challenging the state's top election official on a balloting decision he made.

Like personal injury lawyers scouring an accident-prone intersection for the next collision, thousands of attorneys across the nation are gearing up for the first presidential contest since Bush vs. Gore and the Florida meltdown of 2000.

The legal work is taking place to varying degrees in about 20 states where the race is expected to be the closest. Ohio and Florida, both large states where it's now exceptionally tight, have received the most attention.

The unprecedented level of pre-election lawyering comes amid new and untested laws, surges in voter registration, and poll workers stressed by the need to learn how to deal with new ballots and voting equipment.

While no one is predicting the perfect storm of election mishaps and razor-slim margins that resulted in the last presidential election being determined by the U.S. Supreme Court, the potential for extensive court activity exists.

Democrats and Sen. John Kerry, vowing not to be caught off guard again, have crafted a legal response plan that includes five "SWAT teams" ready to fly anywhere a recount or other legal challenges seem warranted.

Legal command centers will be set up in some states, including Ohio and Florida, where top election lawyers will be armed with a variety of pre-drafted pleadings, should the decision be made to seek an emergency court hearing somewhere.

Republicans, meanwhile, are placing lawyers on call in battleground states, where coveted electoral votes could, theoretically, be determined by which side is best prepared to prove that voters have or have not been disenfranchised.

President Bush's campaign has said it is targeting about 30,000 precincts in 17 states, places seen as key to victory or where past election problems have arisen. Lawyers, law students and others will watch those precincts or be on call there.

But it's here in Ohio that experts believe there is the greatest potential for another Florida, primarily because more than two-thirds of voters will use punch-card ballots similar to those that produced the infamous hanging chad of 2000.

Several of Ohio's largest counties have already declared mutiny against the state's top election official and his recent ruling that provisional ballots must not be given to voters who appear at the wrong polling place.

Provisional ballots - new to some states, but not Ohio - allow voters with questions surrounding their registrations to cast special ballots that are reviewed after the election to determine whether they came from legitimate voters.

While reforms have resolved some problems witnessed in the 2000 election, they've created others, leaving this election still susceptible to under counting, over-counting, miscounting and some voters who won't be counted at all.

The American Civil Liberties Union has already challenged Florida Secretary of State Glenda Hood for a decision by her office to urge local election officials to discard voter registration forms where new voters failed to check a box indicating their citizenship.

And Blackwell, who has made several controversial pre-election decisions that have angered Democrats, acknowledged earlier this week that he expects Ohio will see "lawsuits fly," if the election outcome is close.

Volunteers are doing much of the legal work, Kerry's campaign has raised money to prepare for recounts, telling potential donors it doesn't want Democrats to be "outgunned, out-manned and out matched" again.

Headline: National talents shine at Fete
Author: By Christina Perez-Gurri / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The sun gleamed on the tops of the tents and bounced off the bright, orange and blue shirts of the Angostura promoters.

It was Oct. 2 and the fourth annual All Inclusive University Fete, a celebration of Caribbean culture, food, and music at the Biscayne Bay Campus, was about to begin, its proceeds used for FIU School of Hospitality Management scholarships.

The smell of barbecued chicken, curried potatoes, cured pork, jerk chicken and corn soup filled the air. 

To the side of the event, a large, blue and yellow tent housed the liquor supply for the evening, managed by Angostura, the event's main sponsor, and a premium rum company from Trinidad.

Claire Hutin, a junior in Professor Michael Moran's Culinary Events Management class, prepared cured pork tenderloin in her own booth.  

"Several other classes joined in to make this happen. We prepared enough food to feed 4,000 people," Hutin said.

Students from from the School of Hospitality Management came together to creat different themed booths, each preparing dishes they learned in their respective classes. 

The booths carried an international flavor but Caribbean cuisine dominated.

Many of the bands that performed traveled  from other cities,  states and generated much excitement.

Neri Torres and the Ife-Ile Dance Company performed first. Their music, a blend of salsa, Cuban congo and "sabor cubano" (Cuban flavor), played as choreographed dancers took the stage and interacted with the audience.

 Jonathan Persuade and Denesh Somwaru flew in from New York for the Fete. 

They said they most looked forward to the women, the dancing, the food and the music.

The event, which was opened to students as well as members of the community cost $75 a ticket. 

A heavy promotional campaign preceded the event, hoping to draw as many people from different backgrounds as possible. 

Kathryn Morris, a resident of Plantation, has attended the Fete four years in a row. 

Like every visitor there, she has a favorite part of the event.

"The end of the party is fun, the parade and steel band is a nice way to end the event," she said. 

While the stage was set for Roy Cape Band, another performer, a sea of red, black and white flags waved in the air. The band sang, "I love my flag." 

According to many bands, the event celebrated of  peace, love, music and overcoming five hurricanes.

"Being in a band like this, there is no need for drugs because music puts you on a natural high," said Dexter Stewart, one of three main vocalists for Roy Cape. 

Other performers included Roger George, a popular soca singer and Adesh Samaroo, with a final performance by King David Rudder.

Headline: French ban angers FIU students
Author: By Alenette Acuesta Opena / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The world's Muslim population has been in an uproar since early March of this year when the French government-with the support of President Jacques Chirac-approved a bill banning the display of religious items in public schools.

Though the law, which aims to completely remove religion from French schools, will prohibit the wearing of Jewish yarmulkes and Christian crosses, it is primarily aimed at stopping Muslim women and girls from wearing the hijab, or traditional head scarf.

As year long protests have raged from the streets of Paris to the shores of North Africa, students within FIU have been voicing their opinions on the controversial subject.

"I believe that this decision raises many issues regarding religious and cultural tolerance," History major Pablo Avendano said. "It is also an infringement on the right to religious practice...To enforce secularism on people is just as bad as trying to enforce certain religious or cultural practices on them."

Nour Kablawi, president of FIU's Muslim Student Organization, has been closely following the events in France and thinks that, although the law will be equally implemented against all religions, Islam will be the most targeted.

"This law is discriminatory against Muslims only and Muslims in particular simply because Christians are not required by their faith to wear crosses, nor are Jews required to wear the Star of David," he said.

Nour also stated that, since  wearing a hijab might be an obligation upon Muslim women, preventing them from  wearing it would be interfering with their right to practice their religion.

Although in recent years some Muslim women have chosen to discard their head scarves, those who still wear them find pride and meaning behind the cloth.

To Aminah Abdelhaq, an education major, the head scarf signifies modesty and a way to express her cultural beliefs.

"It's strange to think that some people find this practice weird when not too long ago, their ancestors used to cover their hair, wear long sleeves and skirts. A lot of people expressed modesty in their own way. This is simply the Muslim female way," she said.

Nevertheless, she also acknowledged the freedom of choice that comes with adopting the scarf; she is the only girl of four in her family to wear it.

Though discussions regarding the French events have taken place within FIU's Muslim organizations, the reactions within the Islamic community itself have become a prime topic.

The most controversial protest took place in late August when a militia group called the Islamic Army kidnapped two French journalists stationed in Iraq. When word of the hostage situation reached the large Muslim population in France, peaceful marches were organized to demonstrate the community's outrage at the drastic measures.

"We will not allow our head scarves to be soiled in blood," proclaimed Muslim women as they took to the streets.

Through these demonstrations of, many saw hope or an eventual peaceful conclusion to the ongoing religious issues in the French education system.

"I was quite proud as a French citizen when, after the kidnapping of the two French reporters in Iraq, the Muslim Commission declared...that they did in no way support the kidnapper's demands. To me, that shows it is possible for Islam's precepts to coincide with the republican ideal," said Marie-Claire Lochet, an international relations major.

Still, despite these organized efforts, the hostages remain in the hands of their captors.

The hijab issue has been debated since 1989 when two Muslim girls refused to remove their heads carves in class. Though the French Court of Appeals ruled in the girls' favor, the current administration's goal to completely secularize society has brought the issue back into international focus.

On campus Muslim organizations will continue to discuss the topic as long as it is relevant, welcoming students to contact them with any questions regarding the issue.

Headline: Dolce Vita highlight of film fest
Author: Jose Aparicio / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When you think of Italian films, one name that instantly comes to mind is Federico Fellini. His influence reaches beyond Italian film makers to film makers around the world. A consortium of sponsors with the group Italian Film Festival Inc. held an Italian Film Festival Oct. 9 through Oct. 13. to celebrate this past year's Italian films that have been critically acclaimed at Cannes and other such events. A screening of Fellini's "La Dolce Vita"  kicked off the event. 

The film is about Marcello Mastroianni. a gossip columnist who chronicles the sweet life of rich and famous playboys, models, actors, actresses and general aristocrats who pass through Rome. 

As we look at Marcello the actor we can see the two Marcellos (the character and the actor) come together as art and life imitate each other. Both were desperate men who dreamed of something better but were trapped in debauched nights and reborn in lonely dawns.

There are many of interpretations of this classic film. One is that Fellini shows the seven sins. Others think he shows us seven nights and seven dawns. Yet another theory is that the movie takes place on the seven hills of Rome. I believe that the heart of the movie is an allegory told to warn us of living a life devoid of a center or meaning. Each night as Marcello commits some kind of debauchery with whatever woman he fancies that night, he seems to be reborn at dawn. Marcello starts every morning anew, with new hopes and dreams for a better, more fulfilling day, only to have those dreams shattered with his first sips of alcohol and first flirtations of the night. 

As we begin to understand the film's structure better we see one of the recurring motifs. As Marcello goes through a series of nights and dawns, descents and ascents, he goes from embracing his life of debauchery to wanting to elevate himself to something higher with purpose and meaning. 

Fellini journeys through his character's moral life. Depending on your age and attitude it can be tragic or wonderful. Marcello is able to find some sort of happiness in this life without meaning full of drunken nights. You might ask, is there really anything wrong with that? This was a great film to watch, and I highly recommend it to any movie buffs. It was recently released on DVD in September. 

It was screened for free at the Cosford cinema at the University of Miami on Oct. 9.

The rest of the week was marked by multiple screenings of various Italian films at the Miracle Theater in Coral Gables. And, for those who had the means to indulge in la dolce vita, there was a closing dinner and awards ceremony, complete with a "tropical" bar, live music, a gourmet dinner with Italian wines. It will also featured a meet and greet with the stars of the recent films screened throughout week. 

It is always nice to broaden your horizons with films from around the world. This was an easy way to do so. The event had quite a bit of people in attendance but it was hardly difficult to get seats.

Headline: Theater season kicks off with classic thriller
Author: Angela Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
FIU will kick off its 2004-'05 theatre season with a bloody bite but in good taste. The play "Dracula" will debut Oct. 14 at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center's Black Box Theatre. "Dracula" originated from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same title. Playwright Leroy Clark has crafted a new adaptation of the horrifying vampire story, which combines mystery and thrills. 

Leroy Clark is a professor and director of theatre, and chair of the Department of Theatre, Dance, and Speech. Dr. Clark has written more than 25 plays; 14 (including "Dracula") have been produced in 17 professional, community, and university theatres. With "Dracula," he explores why people hide their fears, true feelings and insecurities behind a social mask. Yet, people metaphorically become "Dracula" every time someone or something tries to take that mask off. 

"We all have that inner evil inside that we want to let out when people cut you off or drive you insane trying to know too much about you without reason," actor Michael Leone said.

"Dracula"'s 18-member cast is a mix of students with considerable performance experience and enthusiastic beginners. It is also a racially and ethnically diverse group with white, black and hispanic actors. 

"I want it to provide opportunities for black actors, as well as any other kind of nationality. I didn't want that to get in the way," said Clark. "I even had the black actors audition for the lead characters because I would have gone for  a black Dracula if it would have been the case." 

Clark also mentioned that the diversity of the group forced him to choose an exotic setting for the play. New Orleans seemed to be the perfect place because it embraces the French, Spanish, and black culture of the South and the Caribbean. 

The play is set there in the courtyard outside Dr. Seward's house, where the blood-thirsty vampire attacks his victims. 

Like the novel-based movie in 1992, Dracula's first victim is Lucy and then Mina, who is madly in love with him. Director Clark explained that the production is not focused on the end of the story because it is already well-known. This rendition of the play is focused on a suspenceful plot. 

"In this story the journey that gets you to the end is the fun and interesting part: Who gets killed or knocked off along the way, as well as the special effects and the great interaction among the characters," he said. 

Clark has also introduced voodoo rituals, drumming, Spring Carnivale revelers in masks and flamboyant customs to spice up the play and give new twists to an old story. 

"We want 'Dracula' to appeal to the public.  We want students to come and enjoy the modern version. We are getting close to Halloween so I thought it would be a fun show to do and make it very American, giving it a Southern Gothic flavor with the voodoo scene and the revelers engaging in rituals, praying and dancing," Leroy Clark said.

The cast of "Dracula's" has been rehearsing for more than three hours a day, Monday through Friday at FIU's Black Box Theatre  to ensure "Dracula" is successful.  

Actor Cyrina Fiallo said, "I think we've put a lot of ourselves into the characters and into the play, we have a pretty talented cast, and I'm sure we will definitely bring something really good to it." They hope the audience arrives with an open mind and is entertained by the production. 

"I'm hoping to get the couple of chuckles here and there, with the parts that seem [comedic] because we are hoping to pull the audience. We want everybody in this intense, intense, intense mode and then to drop the humor on them to keep everyone awake and entertained," actor Daniel Gutierrez said. 

 The play will run Oct. 14 through Oct. 24. Performances begin at 8 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Sunday matinees start at 2 p.m. Tickets are $8 for students and $10 for the general public. 

For more information, call the Box Office  at (305) 348-3789 on Monday through Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., or one hour prior to performance or visit www.fiu.edu/%7Ethedan.
