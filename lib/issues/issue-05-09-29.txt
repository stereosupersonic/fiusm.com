Headline: "Military Lies to Prospective Recruits"

&nbsp;
It is disappointing to read the editorial "Military Lies to Prospective Recruits".  This is a very biased and racially charged opinion article.  The writer demonstrates a lack of understanding and investigation into military demographics (by his own admission) but proceeds to offer antidotal comments as fact anyway.

The writer is tired of receiving unsolicited or unwanted recruiting or sales pitches and we say welcome to the club.  If you want to write about feeling "harassed" then simply say so.  We receive unwanted solicitations from insurance companies, window salesmen, auto dealers and the like.  Solicitation hasn't led us to write a diatribe about the evils of those organizations and to demean those in it as "low income or minority", "farm boys" and "uneducated"; duped by the evil "them" and "they".

Another issue the author has with the military seems to be related to involuntary "tours".  There have been troops involuntarily extended because of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but a large majority of personnel are still departing active duty "on-time."  A military contract defines an obligation as 8 years.  About half of this obligation might be active duty and then you can revert to an inactive reserve status. There is that infamous "needs of the military" language in the contract though. 

About 95% of military personnel have a high school diploma, compared to the overall national average of only 79%.  Since the overwhelming majority of people in the military have at least graduated from high school, we surmise that they can read contracts and make informed decisions about what they want to do with their lives.

There are millions of educated, articulate human beings who have served or are currently serving in the military.  About 5.6% of military personnel have a master's degree compared to 4.6% of the national average from little known universities like Harvard, MIT and FSU. 

The majority of military personnel do not routinely carry around weapons all day.  They do things like; repair aircraft, deliver logistical supplies, work with advanced computers and electronics, cook food, test equipment, educate, drive trucks, and lead people with tremendous attributes.  Don't we do these things in civilian life?  

Civilian employers and "head hunters" regularly canvas military installations, recruiting Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel out of the military.  Why? What could "carrying an assault rifle" do to prepare you for civilian life?  My glib response; apply to a police SWAT team. 

In reality it is not about the rifles, tanks, planes and ships.  It is about the people, male and female, of all races in statistical proportions that mirror the demographics of America at large. These people, through military service, demonstrate an ability to accomplish tasks and have a good work ethic. They have good discipline, seek responsibility, and manage themselves and others well. Shockingly, most employers in America actually perceive troops as humans that can learn to do other things after the military.

The military executes operations in over 60 countries and there are "exotic places." There are also jungles and deserts and they are full of repressed, oppressed, and starving people.  Most of the missions assigned to military have little to do with combat operations but modern Army recruiting posters show troops in desert uniforms holding weapons.  The military does a staggering number of missions, in support of humanitarian assistance operations, in Third World countries and recently the hurricane devastated gulf coast.  Often military goes to dangerous places to provide humanitarian aid because civilian organizations will not go.  

A profession doesn't operate perfectly and without fault.  A profession is expected to monitor and discipline itself.  The military is not the only noble profession in America but it is one of them.  From top to bottom, the members of the military deserve more respect.  In return, we concede, that the military should stop sending the writer invites to join.

Subheadline: Golden Panthers VS FAMU Rattlers
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
When: Oct. 1 at 6:00 p.m.
Where: FIU Football Stadium
TV: None
Radio: WKAT 1360 AM, WRGP 88.1 FM 
Record: FIU 0-3, Florida A&M 2-2

On offense, We know FIU can move the ball against tough opponents. They have amassed over 800 total yards in the past two game. However, they must overcome their horrid performance in the redzone, specifically with turnovers. They must hold on to the football, by grinding it out using their running game. 

On Defense, The Golden Panthers will need to stop at least one aspect of the FAMU offense, whether it be through the air or on the ground. Against Texas Tech, FIU allowed 518 passing. Against Arkansas State they allowed 304 rushing - including two 100 yard rushers. In order for a victory, they must  force turnovers.

Headline: Slow starts doom soccer on road
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team left for California on Sept. 22 with plenty of reasons to smile. The Golden Panthers had just entered the Soccer America national rankings at No. 25 and boasted the second-best record in Conference USA.  

Flying back home to Miami following participation in the SCU/USF Adidas Classic, the tables had turned on FIU. A pair of 3-0 losses to non-conference foes Santa Clara on Sept. 23 and San Francisco on Sept. 25 dropped the Golden Panthers' record to 4-3-0.  

"We lost both of those games in the first 20 minutes," said head coach Karl Kremser. "After that, we were fine."  

The Golden Panthers will strive to start stronger this weekend when they play their inaugural games in Conference USA competition. FIU will host Kentucky on Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. and then Marshall on Oct. 2 at 1 p.m. Both games will be played at the University Park Soccer Stadium.


SCU 3, FIU 0


FIU could not recover from an early deficit and lost its game on Sept. 23 to the No. 12 Santa Clara Broncos 3-0. SCU forward Hector Guzman, midfielder Peter Lowry and defender Jide Ogunbiyi each scored a first-half goal, leaving the Golden Panthers in a hole they could not dig themselves out of.  

Kremser was not surprised by the early attack put on by Santa Clara.

"We knew that was going to happen; we talked to our players about it," Kremser said. "We were very slow; we were hesitant. It's not that I don't think that our kids wanted to do well. For whatever the reason is, we were just not prepared to play."

Outshot 11-6 in the first half, FIU was also on the receiving end of two questionable calls. The first came when freshman Judah Hernandez was taken down in the penalty area. No call was made by officials, much to the dismay of Kremser.

"The goalkeeper should have received a red card because he was the last guy there," he said.

Then, prior to Santa Clara's second goal, officials ruled that a ball, that appeared to go out of bounds off a Bronco forward, was last touched by FIU, awarding a corner kick they never should have received and Santa Clara cashed in.

The Golden Panthers came close to scoring several times but Bronco goalkeeper Kevin Sweeney denied them with fingertip saves.  

FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe tied his season-high with five saves that night and defender Pierre HÃ³Sang led the team with three shots.


USF 3, FIU 0


Kremser started five different players in the team's second game of the SCU/USF Adidas Classic. Yet, the result was the same. The San Francisco Dons shutout the Golden Panthers 3-0 on Sept 25.  

The most noteworthy lineup change for FIU came at goalie, where Kremser started freshman Kyle Thomas in place of junior Shawn Crowe.

"Kyle actually did quite well," said Kremser. "He made some nice saves; he was good in the air."  

Following a goal by Dons' forward Brandon MacDonald in the ninth minute, Thomas and the Golden Panthers  fell prey to a bit of bad luck. In the 14th minute, Thomas made successive saves off Aaron Chandler and Ben Dessard and was about to cover the ball up when teammate Jared Rose attempted to clear the ball.

"Jared didn't know if he had control of it," Kremser said. "He wound up and really took a whack at the ball to clear it and hit Kyle in the hand, at which point the ball squirted loose and the guy (Matt Languis) kicked it for the second goal."

Thomas stayed in the game until the 21:04 minutes mark, when swelling forced him to the bench. Crowe replaced Thomas and allowed one quick goal before shutting out USF for the final 65 minutes of the game. Kremser is hopeful that Thomas' injury is not serious.

Offensively, the Golden Panthers struggled to get anything going. Forward Carron Williams, the leading scorer in Conference USA, was held shotless against the Dons and got off only one shot against the Broncos two days earlier.

"They did their homework on him," Kremser said. "I think he really got abused in those games, especially in the first one. He just got crunched. The officiating didn't help.

"They knew that he was dangerous and so they really watched him pretty carefully, and then when he did get the ball they let him have it," Kremser said.

Williams and the rest of the men's soccer team will look to rebound this weekend. They begin a stretch of nine consecutive Conference USA matches with home games against Kentucky (3-2-3) on Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. and Marshall (2-5-0) on Oct. 1 at 1 p.m.  

"These games are very important and I hope our guys realize that," Kremser said. "We have to come out and play, especially against Kentucky. If we've learned anything from this weekend, it is that we have to come prepared to play because Kentucky plays a lot like San Francisco and Santa Clara."  

Students can gain free admission to both games by presenting their PantherCard outside the soccer stadium before game time.

Subheadline: Mental mistakes cost team dearly in SBC opener
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The posture of senior linebacker Gerrod Bodie said it all as Arkansas State kicked to FIU with 4:56 minutes left in regulation. 

With hands on his hips and facemask facing the turf, Bodie represented what the entire FIU football family felt as the clock ticked down on their first ever Sun Belt Conference game. The Golden Panthers (0-3, 0-1 SBC) fell 66-24 on the road to hosts Arkansas State (2-2, 1-0 SBC) Sept. 24 at Indian Stadium.

 FIU turned the ball over seven times while giving up the most points in school history. Starting quarterback Josh Padrick threw four interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown and the Golden Panthers fumbled the ball twice. 

"We had opportunities. There was no doubt about it," said head coach Don Strock, following the loss. "But when you turn the ball over and give them a short field to work with, [Arkansas State] is an excellent football team who is going to take advantage of that. There are no excuses. We got beat today."

The Golden Panther defense was outmatched from the start and gave up 304 yards rushing, including 144 and 105 yards from Indian tailbacks Antonio Warren and Shermar Bracey, respectively. 

"One of the things that came back to bite us was our inability to stop the run," Strock said. "That's been a problem, basically since we started. You keep trying to improve there and we have, but obviously, it didn't show today."

FIU was unable to start up the running game, which allowed the Indians to control the game.

Padrick ended the day 24-of-37 for 270 yards and a touchdown; the turnovers and costly penalties made the difference. 

Right from the start, Arkansas State showed what they were going to put forth. On the first play from scrimmage, starting tailback Antonio Warren, who was coming in averaging 127 yards per game, split the Golden Panther linebackers and rolled down the field for a 50 yard touchdown. 

Much of the same was to follow. 

Warren, who only played the first half after being carted off at halftime with an ankle injury, broke 100 yards for the fourth time this season, rushing for 144 yards on eight carries. 

 Bracey, his replacement, showed much of the same in the second half, as he exploited the FIU front line rushing for 105 yards on nine carries.    

However, FIU did have bright spots in the game. With 5:01 minutes left in the first quarter, Padrick hooked up with wide out Cory McKinney for a 28 yard touchdown which cut the Indian lead to 14-7. The eight play, 85 yard drive, will go into the history books as the first points scored by FIU in the Sun Belt Conference play. 

Padrick's second interception of the first quarter would be a costly one. ASU walked down the field and went up by three touchdowns 28-7 as quarterback Nick Noce met up with Joe Smith for the first of two touchdowns. Smith was left wide open by the Panther secondary in the corner of the end zone for an easy catch.

Early in the second quarter FIU got back on the board as Padrick kept the football and reached the end zone capping off an 11th play and a 76 yard drive - in which the offense looked comfortable for the first time all day. Padrick completed 5-of-6 passes and brought the Panthers back to 28-14 down.

The following ASU drive was the dagger in FIU's chances of coming back. 

After the successful drive by the offense, the defense stepped on the field determined to stop the Indians for the first time all day. That is exactly what they did holding the hosts to a three-and-out. The next play, however, did not go as planned for FIU.

On the Indian punt the Golden Panthers were called for a roughing the kicker penalty giving ASU a first down. They took advantage scoring on a 49 yard touchdown pass from Noce to Smith for their second combination of the day. The hosts went up 35-14 with 6:33 minutes left in the half and inevitably put the game away.   

FIU would get three points back right before halftime as kicker Adam Moss connected from 29 yards out and entered the locker room trailing 35-17.

The second half did not get any prettier for the visiting Golden Panthers. After trading turnovers with ASU, FIU managed a second and goal from the ASU five. Padrick was then intercepted by Indian defensive back Tyrell Johnson at the one yard line; he proceeded to take the ball all the way back to the FIU seven yard line and setup a first and goal.

The Golden Panther defense once again stepped up in an effort to keep the score close, forcing a fourth and goal from the five. FIU was once again flagged for a personal foul during the field goal, a mistake that would cost them four points. 

ASU took the new set of downs from the one and Indian tailback Chris Easley punched the ball in from one yard out putting the Indians up 45-17.

FIU would go on to turn the ball over three more times in the fourth quarter, which all led to ASU touchdowns. 

McKinney fumbled for the second time which led to a 34-yard touchdown run; Padrick threw an interception at the 15 that was returned 85 yards for a touchdown by safety Koby McKinnon; and backup quarterback Tommy Kendrick, who would later get his first career touchdown pass, threw an interception that would eventually give ASU a 66-17 lead. 

Strock was clear with his words following the mentally tough loss. 

"I've been in tough games before and obviously, this is a tough one. We've got to look at a lot of people out on the field today who we think can help us down the road. But there's a lot of work to do, without a doubt," Strock said. 

FIU's season continues this Saturday, Oct. 1 with the Golden Panthers home opener against FAMU for the 69th annual Orange Blossom Classic. Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. at FIU stadium.

Subheadline: Online course fee not sensible in light of recent gas price hikes
Author: Cristina Ugalde / Senion Education Major
&nbsp;
The other day while browsing through The Beacon, there was an interesting article about classes being offered at FIU that are fully online. I thought this was great because I did more than half of my Associates in Arts degree online and appreciate the flexible opportunities this alternative way of learning is.  

However, I was totally surprised that FIU's charging an extra fee for these classes. I can't believe that FIU, being a public institution and Miami's first public research univeristy, hasn't researched that some of their competitors don't charge fees, or if they do, they're extremely minimal for the online courses. I came to FIU with the understanding that this is one of the best institutes for learning.  

My mother went here a few years ago. Back then, it was smaller, though parking was still a mission, the school did try to accomodate for all students. Now it seems as if the school just wants to accomodate financially and for recognition purposes.  

With the price of gas going up and tuition on the constant rise, why would you charge more for an online course? It's mind-boggling how it can be more costly for a university to pay a professor to sit in a room or cubicle to review students' work online versus having them in an actual classroom, with air conditioner, overhead projectors running, computers & lights on, maintainence and parking? I may not be a Math genius but the numbers don't add up.  What exactly is the purpose for these fees again?

Headline: Military lies to prospective recruits
Author: Ben Badger / Webmaster
&nbsp;
We have all seen and heard the TV commercials, internet, movies and radio ads surrounding our country's military. What do they all have in common? They all make the military look like one big picnic in the park on a Saturday afternoon. It's deplorable, yet the military, is a necessary evil. If this country did not have it, well then we would not have a country. 

We need to add fresh blood to our military every so often in order to keep it alive, but the manner in which our government acquires that new blood is what disgusts me.

All I ever hear is that if you join the military you will be able to see the world and travel places you have only dreamed of what they don't mention is that "seeing the world" actually means a desert somewhere in Iraq or Afghanistan. It's rarely ever any of the exotic places you see on television.  

But the real kicker is how long they keep you there. Best example would be how many recruits were only supposed to be given an assignment for, let's say, three tours. Well, those same recruits often stay for six. Is this scientific data? Of course it's not, I'm not an analyst. But is it the truth? Yes. 

The reason our government gives for keeping our men and women overseas for so long is that there are not enough troops so the ones they have they need to make last - not the government's exact words, but that's the gist of it. So if I have that little detail straight, the government kidnaps recruits against their will and forces them to fight? Wow! I thought the draft was retired a long while ago, but that's what this is - a roundabout draft.

And besides the whole "seeing the world" story, the government also likes to tell people that joining the military will give you valuable training for life back in the states - yeah right. How in God's name is knowing how to shoot an assault rifle going to help any person in any normal job? The answer is it won't. 

The truth is, very few jobs in the military can give you any real training for careers back in the U.S. There are only a handful of people who get those jobs, but the paradox is that only those who already know how to do the job (such as operating communication devices or a triage position) will get the job.  

If it is the other way around, would you want some farm boy with no real medical training stitching deep gash in your arm? I think not!

Basically, the military won't actually train you to do anything you don't already know how to do, other than fighting, of course.Besides lying to people in order for them to join, there is only one other aspect of recruiting that enrages me more. That is, who the military targets for recruitment. 

The people targeted for recruitment are the impoverished and the minorities.

On their part, it is a stroke of genius. Go to people who have almost nothing, lie to them, and then hold them against their will. It's genius! But just 'cause it's a smart business plan (because that's how our government looks at recruiting, as a business) doesn't mean that it's in any way acceptable. 

Ok, so not everyone in the army is of low income or a minority, but in fact, statistics seem to indicate there are a greater percentage of military officers in the military than the number of high ranking minorities in corporate and or academic worlds.I just can't get over the way the military recruits them. And they are relentless in their recruitment efforts.

Sometimes I feel as if the military is one big spam e-mail that does not stop. I continue to receive phone calls, emails, and pamphlets in the mail from the military, even though I am in no way medically able to join the armed forces.

 I made the mistake of not filling out a form in high school which would have prevented the military from gaining access to my personal information, which evidentially they got. And if a well-educated person like myself forgot to fill out this form, how many of the under-educated people forgot to fill it out or even knew what it was? 

Long story short, I hate when people are lied to on a grand scale by our military. We are the fish and the enticing offers of seeing the world and any other fringe benefit are the worm on the fishing hook. Our military is increasingly making bigger and bigger catches with the larger and larger worms.

FEMA, Carnival Cruise Lines Under Scrutiny 

Three days after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, FEMA officials contacted Bob Dickinson, the president and chief executive of Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines, asking if the agency could use three of their cruise liners as temporary housing for evacuees left homeless after the storm hit.

In two days, Dickinson agreed to provide the ships for $192 million. U.S. House representatives are now asking the Department of Homeland Security to provide documentation into the Sept. 2 deal and say they plan to order a Congressional investigation.

Apart from the $192 million, FEMA also agreed to reimburse Carnival for fuel and other costs through February - a total of $44 million additional fees. The House representatives say they estimate the cost for a family of five appears to exceed $20,000 per month. A cost, representatives say, that is far more than community-based housing and other options.

FEMA hopes to fill the ships with more than 7,000 people who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina.

Headline: Honors College celebrates with convocation ceremony
Author: Charlene Collazo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Lined up in a sea of white polo shirts and flags along the Betty Chapman Plaza of the Graham Center, Honors College students and faculty braved the Florida heat to celebrate the start of convocation week with a parade following a convocation program to honor the opening of the Fifth Annual Honors College Convocation.  

This year, Convocation Week celebrates five years of a tradition that recognizes academic excellence and promotes unity.  With its start in 1997, the Honors College has grown to reach almost 1,100 students.

The celebration began with the Parade of Nations and States headed by the FIU marching band. Student participants of the college had the chance to parade a flag that represented the students' place of origin.  

With many flags from distinctive places such as Canada, the Dominican Republic and Germany, not only was unity celebrated, but also the abundance of diversity that makes the college unique.  

"I was asked as a favor to be one of the student participants to hold a flag. I was happy to do it and be a part of something special," said sophomore Alex Diaz, who celebrates for the second time.  

Towards the end of the parade line, many students, not only from the Honors College but university-wide, followed the route that started from the entrance to the Graham Center, around the Primera Casa building until its final stop at the fountain located between GC and Deuxieme Maison.  

Enclosed in the fountain courtyard, the marching band was center-stage playing renditions of songs. To hype up students, a quick introduction speech was made by Nidia Cruz, Honors College representative, followed by speeches from Student Government Association and the dean of the Honors College, Ivelaw L. Griffith. 

"This parade is meant to show the prevailing excellence that the Honors College has because it started small and now it's huge," said freshman Kaila Wong.    

At the closing ceremony, new faculty fellows were inducted and awards were presented to winners of a student competition.  

With the ceremonies theme "Celebrating Excellence," academic talent was recognized by handing out prizes to winning entries submitted by Honors College students that included poetry, prose, essays, science and technology, art and multimedia.  

All entries were requested one month in advance and were submitted to a special faculty committee that judges the best work from each category. Prizes included cruises weekend resorts, computers and gift certificates to wonderful places.  

The invocation speech presented by Honors College fellow Joyce Peterson, defined invocation while reminding the FIU community to remember the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 

More than 300 students participated in this all-day event.  Sharon Placide, dean of Student Services for the Honors College, showed enthusiasm as she noted the high attendance at the convocation, which meant that the college's goals were being achieved. 

"We have a three-fold goal: provide opportunities for visibility of the college, student competition and recognition of faculty and finally, community involvement," she said. "We have achieved our goals as many university partners are involved and there is a bigger appreciation for the quality of students."

Headline: Jewish students strive for culture on campus
Author: Ian Nathaniel Cohen / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When asked their opinion of Jewish life at FIU, feedback from Jewish students ranged from mixed to negative.

"It's not exactly as overt or open as I think it should be or could be, but I think there is a Jewish presence," said sophomore Aaron Margolis. 

"Jewish life at FIU is almost non-existent," said freshman Samantha Robbins.  "I also don't think there's a large Jewish community on campus, so why would they cater to the minority?"

Those views may change soon, thanks to the efforts of various Jewish student outreach organizations such as Chabad, Hillel Second Generation and the Jewish Student Union. They plan to increase outreach efforts to Jewish students, attempting to provide more programs and activities for them.

"From what we can see so far, there's a lot of interest in expanding Jewish life on campus," said Rebeca Izquierdo, director of Hillel Second Generation, also known as H2G.  "There's a lot of room to grow, and I'd say that we're getting lots of positive responses with what's been done so far."

"I think that FIU is very open to accommodating Jewish students," said Rabbi Levi Friedman of FIU's Chabad Jewish Student Center.  "I find them to be very welcoming and helpful and willing to work with us."

Freshman Natalie Shamai, who frequently attends H2G events, shares that sentiment, citing the growing number of Jewish organizations on campus, as well as strong turnouts at events they have hosted this year.  

"There's a lot of buzz, and a lot of people are coming out who enjoy it," Shamai said.

Chabad and H2G share the goal of expanding Jewish life on campus and creating an overall community atmosphere for Jewish students, regardless of their affiliation or level of observance.

"We have no agenda," said Corrie Coff, engagement associate for H2G.  "We don't seek to form anyone's opinion for them. We seek to make available to them the resources that will enrich their Jewish experience in life, and if that's just cultural, that's just fine."

"We're non-judgmental," Friedman said.  "We welcome everyone equally."

In some cases, students who have become involved in various Jewish organizations at FIU have uncovered a strong Jewish presence.

"If I was not involved with Chabad, or even aware that Chabad existed, I wouldn't even think there were other Jews at the school," said junior Sarah Steinfeld.  "Hopefully, we'll bring a lot more people in through word of mouth."

FIU's Jewish Student Union is also gaining considerable momentum after it was established approximately a year ago and works frequently with H2G.

"Last year, we did some events on campus, this year, we're planning on doing a lot more," said junior Maya Shamai of the Jewish Student Union. "The JSU being on campus is our way of doing that.  We table so we can find students and figure out what they want, and we make it happen."  

A major concern among FIU's Jewish student population is the lack of availability of kosher meals, an issue Chabad is currently addressing by trying to arrange for kosher meals to be made available at PantherStop.  

"So far, people have been receptive to it," Friedman said.

"Rabbi Friedman approached us and asked us about getting kosher foods in the convenience store," said Jim Brogan, general manager of the FIU Bookstore. "We're trying to find a distributor."

Another concern among Jewish students is the scheduling of tests on important Jewish holidays, a situation Margolis described as "Horrendous.  I have not one professor who takes that into consideration, even remote consideration," Margolis said.

At the beginning of the year, a printing error in the school calendar resulted in the dates of all holidays being listed on the wrong days, in some instances resulting in tests scheduled on the Jewish High Holidays, the most sacred days of the Jewish calendar.  

Rosh HaShanah is the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur is the day to ask forgiveness from God for their sins. Fasting is also required throughout Yom Kippur.

This year, Rosh HaShanah begins the evening of Oct. 3, and continues through the night of  Oct.  5.  Yom Kippur begins the evening of Oct. 12 and concludes the night  Oct. 13.

If students wishing to observe the High Holidays have a class conflict on these days, Rabbi Friedman said that Chabad will "provide students with a letter saying that for religious reasons, they won't be able to [attend class.]  Usually, professors are accommodating."

This semester will be the first time that High Holiday services for Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur will be available for students at the University Park campus.  

Chabad will be conducting High Holiday services at the Comfort Suites on 3901 117th Avenue (see the box below for a complete schedule).  

"High Holiday services is something we're very excited about. We offer free services and free meals.  You don't need any membership or affiliation: it's open to all. Services will be user-friendly," Friedman said. "We'll be doing some reading in English, and have explanations and commentary. We're trying to keep it very interesting, and make sure that it's relevant and practical and inspirational to all."

Throughout the year, Chabad offers classes on various aspects of Judaism. H2G holds a wide variety of events for students, such as Wednesday night study groups, poker and bowling nights and guest speakers. Both offer Shabbat dinners and get-togethers.

Students looking for additional information about Jewish events on both campuses can refer to Chabad of FIU's website at www.chabadfiu.com Rabbi Friedman can be contacted directly via e-mail at rabbi@chabadfiu.com. H2G's website is www.h2gonline.org.com, and Rebeca Izquierdo can be reached at rizquierdo@miamihillel.org.

Headline: Fiona Apple is extraordinary
Subheadline: After a five-year hiatus, the queen of angst comes back with Extraordinary Machine
Author: Michelle Santisteban
&nbsp;
Loyal Fiona Apple fans have waited years for this, and the day is almost here. On Oct. 4, her new album Extraordinary Machine, her first since 2000's When the Pawn, is finally being released to the masses. 

The buzz about Apple's new album has gotten around, and on Thursday, Sept. 29, there will be a listening party for Extraordinary Machine at the Starbucks in the University Park Bookstore from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. It'll be a chance to listen to the much anticipated album, and to also mingle with fellow Apple fans.

"I'm really excited about Fiona's new album. It's been a long time coming and I can't wait to hear it," said sophmore Matthew Morris, who is majoring in architecture.

The record was originally completed in 2003, but because Sony/Epic, her record label, felt it wouldn't sell enough copies to justify the cost of distributing and promoting it, the album was shelved until now. Although it is not disclosed why they have decided to release it after so many years, it is none-the-less exciting to finally get a chance to hear Apple's new material.

The album was produced by an unlikely person, Mike Elizondo. Elizondo has worked with artists such as Dr. Dre, Eminem and 50 Cent, so it is surprising that Apple would work with a producer who's musical background is so different from her's. The difference between influences produce an interesting outcome, if not an odd one. Of what can be heard on her official www.myspace.com page, the music seems to be trademark Apple, but with a bit more whimsy and swing. She has not lost her touch for creating unique music and eloquent lyrics, that much is evident. Songs like "Oh Well" recall her older material like the song "Get Gone" - Apple seems to still be fighting off the same deadbeat boyfriend with her usual snarky remarks.

Instruments like a bassoon, bells and a mandolin are mixed with synthesized beats and distorted guitars all throughout the album and make for a quirky landscape. But true to her roots, Apple includes in Machine a piano ballad titled "Parting Gift" which gives the record a much needed break from the norm. It's slightly reminiscent of "Never is a Promise," a track off of Tidal, her debut album. Her voice is still crystal clear and vocal skills are still intact, as though she never took a break from the music scene.

All-in-all, Extraordinary Machine is entertaining, as most of Apple's music is. Even though the years have passed, she has changed only for the better. 

Her music is richer sounding, as is her voice, and each track on the record is different from the last. As she says in one of her songs on the CD: "Here's coming a better version of me" - it sure is.

Headline: Band sends a postcard from the world of pop
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you enjoyed Backstreet Boys, N*Sync and 98 Degrees, Click Five might have something for you. 

"Suck" is the pop/rock epitome of the nature of  Click Five's debut album Greeting From Imrie House. It's all of the old pop you love mixed with the new-wave influence rock of today. 

There's a saying in Spanish that roughly translates to "a monkey dressed up in velvet is still a monkey." Click Five dressed up in Italian suits and salon-styled hair is still just your run-of-the-mill boy band. 

Not to say that it's a bad thing at all. Who wouldn't pay to see a monkey dressed in velvet, right? The handsome lads of Click Five - not one of which is older than 23 - have a sound that's often compared to the Beach Boys with a twist of the contemporary mainstream pop/rock of today. 

Proud synthesized guitars, a playful key board and persistently catchy chorus one-liners push through this album in all of its pop-rock glory.

Hailing from the Berklee School of Music, the Boston-bred and educated band has no qualms about being pigeon-holed as pop, as they readily admit that they write "love melodies." 

You might have heard their current single, "Just the Girl." It's a basic rock song about a girl, infused with an eager sing along chorus and excited guitar riffs. 

Lyrics are irresistibly simple and playful. Eric Dillman, the band's front man, does an apt job of delivering the lyrics with his upbeat enthusiasm and you can hear it coming through the speakers: "She's a mystery/She's too much for me/But I keep coming back for more/She's just the girl I'm looking for," sings Dillman on the single. The album kicks up a feel for the 60s teen rock to 80s new wave and it sounds like they've been doing it all their lives. 

Click Five started out their career playing cover songs at the local club scene in Boston. 

Tipping their hat to their new-wave influence, they include a cover of "Lies," which was originally sung by the Thompson Twins in the 80s, onto their album. Usually, cover songs don't do the original any justice, and rarely ever improve upon it,Â but Click Five does a great job at ushering the song's seamless transition for today's audience. 

Don't let the fact that the band has a keyboard player throw you off. On the keyboard melodies of the song "Friday Night," Ben Roman helps make the song charming - just as feel good music should be - and you can't help but want to bounce along with it.Â 

Suffice to say that his talent as the band's lyricist and keyboard player is a helpful addition to their music.

Greetings From Imrie House stands out most because of its hard-to-forget choruses.Â 

It could be Dillman crooning "Baby, I'll take my chances with you," or giving the warning: "Well she's hotter than hell and she's cool as they come/And she smiled and she's wild all rolled into one"  on "Angel to Me/Devil to You," but Click Five's debut album sticks in your head long after you stop the CD.Â Depending on how you feel about this genre of music, it may or may not be a bad strategy.Â 

But one thing is for certain: F	rom the warm ballad "Take My Chances" to the promising popularity of "Pop Princess," Click Five give their mainstream soccer mom and daughter listeners music that is good, clean rock 'n roll. 

Neither too pretentious, nor esoteric, what really works for the band is that they embrace one of the biggest reasons we love music - because it's fun.

Headline: Tim Burton's "Corpse Bride" brings clay-mation back to theaters
Author: Ashley Capo / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Almost 13 years after the enormously popular release of "A Nightmare Before Christmas," the incomparable Tim Burton came back this fall with his second all-clay animation motion picture, "Corpse Bride." 

Audiences are sure to be tapping their toes to this magnificent tale of "a murder most foul."

Leading the story is a man named Victor Van Dort (voiced by a Burton favorite, Johnny Depp) who is arranged to marry the shy beauty Victoria Everglot (voiced by Emily Watson) by his nouveau riche parents. They've arranged the marriage because of the Everglot's great reputation as a rich family. In fear of being forced to marry a woman he hardly knows, and the inability to properly say his vows, he strolls in the woods to practice them. 

In the process, he places his wedding ring on what looks like a dead twig and out comes the corpse bride (voiced by Helena Bonham-Carter) who, in placing the ring on the "twig," has accidentally married this heartbroken dead woman who was murdered before her prime. In-so-doing, he has to find a way to get back to Victoria without breaking the non-beating heart of his new bride and make it out of the underworld alive.

In proper Burton animation style, this story of true love is explained mostly through song. Although no song is sung by Victor, which is quite sad to Depp fans, the songs are sure to enrapture the audience in this dramatic tale - while adding a few comical lyrics and characters along the way. Even the voice of Danny Elfman, who voiced the character Jack Skellington in " A Nightmare," appears as Bonejangles, the charismatic singing skeleton who tells the young deceased bride's tragic story through his own musical number, which is perhaps one of the best in the movie.

The versatility of Depp, who's starred in other Burton classics such as "Edward Scissorhands," "Ed Wood," "Sleepy Hollow" and as Willy Wonka in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the exceptional Carter, who previously starred with Depp as Mrs. Bucket in "Charlie," bring life to this otherwise dark tale.

By comparison, this is an amazing feat that Burton embarked on, considering the reputation of the memorable "A Nightmare." Many newspapers and magazines even commented on Burton's apparent struggle with making both "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "Corpse Bride" at the same time, but he doesn't fail to dazzle audiences with this cryptic myth.

One qualm with the film would have to be its comparability to the famous "Nightmare Before Christmas." Both share the same kind of gloomy love story, although "Corpse Bride" is significantly more grotesque in story line, and both have the same ill-fated character stereotypes that Burton enjoys to place on-screen. 

Now, if one is not a Burton fanatic, then this film is not for you, for only true fans of the famed director see the difference between all his films' underlying demented tone. Burton is not a happy-go-lucky love-story kind of movie maker. 

His use of dark elements, such as lighting concepts, setting and tone of the characters' skin are all rather alarming to what would be assumed to be a family film, but as afore mentioned, he's just not that kind of guy. Burton fans would be proud to see that the master of the tragic hero doesn't let his crazed audience down with this new edition to the Burton collection.

It is as much of a story of betrayal and love beyond the grave as it is a cartoon with musical numbers and funny clay personalities, this movie has something for the hopeless romantic in all of us. 

If you enjoy a story about princes, castles and princesses with blonde flowing hair, this isn't your kind of movie, but give this film a try anyway. 

You never know what love awaits you beyond the grave.

Headline: 11,000 Parking Spaces for Over 35,000 Students
Subheadline:

11,000 Parking Spaces for Over 35,000 Commuter Students

I was warned of two things before coming to FIU: computer programming classes are conducted without computers in front of students, and the parking is terrible. The former is unbelievably true and the latter is the understatement of the millennia. The parking is not terrible, it is a racquet!  Students are charged $62 per semester for cripplingly insufficient parking.  Add to this the high cost of gasoline wasted while circling or stalking other students for an hour before class to secure a parking spot. Then the cost of the tickets when you must decide if a $20-30 dollar ticket is worth it in order to arrive on time for your test. 

Where is all this revenue from parking fees and tickets going to if not to provide for enough parking? Is it going into the money pit of the millions of dollars in construction of more colleges to attract even more students to the FIU University Park campus? Or reportedly toward the $26 million dollar bill to add a mere 2,800 spaces (that's $9,300 per slot)? According to the President Newsletter in February 2005, with the addition of two parking garages' (III & IV) 2,800 spaces that brings FIU to a grand total of 11,000 parking spots - for BOTH CAMPUSES.

FIU seems to be run much like Miami Dade County is run - an insensible free reign on building to attract more population while blatantly ignoring the need for adequate road system - or in the case of FIU, enough parking.  With no consideration whatsoever for the lack of balance of parking spots to number of students, this creates a heated situation that makes people regret attending FIU just as more people every day are regret living in Dade County any longer. 

A Beacon article date September 12, 2005 addresses the severe parking problem, saying that this has been an ongoing and laborious issue that has not been seriously considered. The article says that recently even though two parking buildings were constructed, this year's freshman class is also 10% larger. So they dropped a bucket of water into the rising tide? Although informational, the article proposed no resolutions. No wonder this is a repetitively dead issue! And administrators cannot say this is unexpected, as a Miami Herald front page article on October 2, 2005 demonstrated the study increase of local/commuter students attending FIU and other universities. Students from four surrounding counties (Broward, Palm Beach, Monroe, and Miami-Dade) has increased from 18,400 in 1989 to a total of 35,061 for last year.  That means that this year we have more than 35,000 commuter students vying for 11,000 spaces on both campuses.  "It's kind of like a flood. You can see the water coming, and you're not sure whether to put sandbags up or divert it" said FIU Provost Mark Rosenberg of the increase in over all attendance. Instead of band-aiding the problem with sandbags, try a proactive approach! If you know it floods, build on higher ground - if you know attendance is increasing, build more parking facilities!

Here's a solution - there is a lot of open land around the University Park campus that could be used for parking. Normally I would say save the land, but face it, we're in South Florida where everything is on its way to being developed anyway.  For a commuter university, that $62 per commuter student per semester comes to a small fortune and I can only imagine the ticket revenue is at least double - that income should go toward expanding the existing parking lots out to 8th street and other perimeter streets. If you take half the total number of commuters (for University Park campus), 15,000 at $62, for just ONE semester that is $930,000. For $930,000 I will come out and pave the land and make a parking lot! And here is the way to demand a solution: If you are sick of paying (without a choice) $62 a semester for the dubious privilege of driving in circles for an hour before class, send an email to the president and let FIU know you want resolution in a timely manner. That email is: Modesto.Maidique@fiu.edu
