Headline: Zaharia overcomes illness to win medals
Subheadline: Olympian set to lead FIU's 
Author: Pete Pelegrin
&nbsp;
There are some things in life that cannot be taught, some things that a person is just born with.

For example: determination.  A person either has it or doesn't.
Gatorade asks the question, "Is it in you?"  For Noemi Zaharia, the new FIU women's swimming coach, it is.

Zaharia grew up with an unquenchable thirst to compete in the Olympic Games.  It was her dream since she first started swimming at a young age.

Nothing was going to stop her from realizing her Olympic dream, or so she thought.

In October of 1987, Zaharia was fine tuning her training for the 1988 Olympic games when she suddenly started feeling very tired and worn down with no strength to swim.

She went to the doctor and discovered she had kidney stones and a urinary tract infection.  

The doctor prescribed medication to treat the infection and get her back on schedule with her training.  It got worse.

The medication started to attack the liver and confined her to a hospital bed for the next six months.  Zaharia felt so much pain that she started "turning yellow."   

The doctor told her she could not partake in any more physical activity and, if she did, it could prove fatal.

She had to give up her life-long dream of swimming in the Olympics.  At least that's what the doctor and everyone else, except Zaharia, thought.
"This was my dream and I was going to follow it," Zaharia said.  "You're going to have tough times in life, but it's how you deal with them that counts."

Zaharia didn't just deal with this tough time, she dove headfirst into it. 

"I knew I had to do some sort of out-of-the-ordinary things to reach my goal," Zaharia said.

She became a stair master.

When the hospital hallways were clear of any doctors or nurses who may see her, Zaharia would sneak out of her room to train by running up and down the sixth floor hospital stairs and jogging around the hospital to stay in shape.

Eventually she was caught by her doctor, who became "angry as hell."
"He says to me, 'do you know you can die?" Zaharia said. I said, 'I don't care, I have to go to the Olympics.'"

Zaharia was released from the hospital in April of 1988.  Again, she was told that she couldn't participate in any physical activity, but it fell on deaf ears.

"She is as stubborn as she is normal," Zaharia's husband, Cristian Zaharia, who also competed in the Olympics in team handball, said.

Time was rapidly ticking away with less than five months left before the Olympics.  Yet Zaharia kicked her training into second gear and got ready to fulfill her dream.

In September 1988, the dream became a reality.

Zaharia, swimming for her native Romania, won the silver medal in the 400 individual medley and bronze in the 200 IM in the Olympics at Seoul, South Korea.  She also competed in the 1992 Olympics.

"I consider it a huge achievement," Zaharia said.  "The doctor said I couldn't do it and you can't tell me I can't do something.  I went back to the doctor's office and showed him my two medals."

"I knew I was taking a chance with my life, but I had to go with what I believed in," Zaharia added.

Don't tell Zaharia the FIU women's swimming program will fail.

"Being named the FIU swimming coach is an unbelievable opportunity," Zaharia said.  

"I get a chance to set a tone, a philosophy from day one.  It gives a chance to show who you are as a coach."

Zaharia describes herself as a dedicated, competitive, straight-forward coach.

"Your reputation as a person leads to your reputation as a coach, and that leads to successful recruiting," Zaharia said.  

"When I say something, that's the way it is."

Part of her coaching philosophy is punctuality and honesty.   Zaharia plans to be upfront with her swimmers and expects them to be able to handle that.

"I do what I ask my swimmers to do," Zaharia said.

Zaharia, whose maiden name is spelled Lung, but pronounced loon-g, hopes to bring a breath of fresh air to FIU swimming in the winter of 2003.

"We need to get the word out about FIU, the school's achievements and its swimming program," Zaharia said.  "I want to start a tradition of FIU as a swim school and be competitive with the UM's, UF's and FSU's and not accept mediocrity.

"Wins are important, but not the most important when starting out," Zaharia added.  "I want to develop a very strong, positive, competitive and tight-knit team.  [I want to] go out and get the best swimmers and build from there."

When she finally does go out and assemble her first team, Zaharia, who's also a part-time motivational speaker, can impart some wisdom swimmers.

"If you have a dream, don't let anyone stop you," Zahaira said.  "Not everyone is an athlete, but we all have our own personal Olympics.  Go out and find your Olympics, your biggest dream, and achieve it."

She did.

Headline: Early runs lead to victories over state rivals UM, B-CC
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU entered the week on a two-game losing streak, but turned its fortunes around with wins over state rivals Miami and Bethune-Cookman, using early leads to propel the team to victories.

FIU 9, Miami 7 

The Golden Panthers (33-14) wasted no time in the team's third match-up of the season with the Miami Hurricanes as FIU scored six runs in the first inning and held off a late surge by the defending national champions (22-22) to win 9-7 Thursday night at Mark Light Stadium. 

Freshman Derek DeCarlo was as dominant as he has been all year, improving his record to 9-0 and going seven strong innings. 

Tommy Dueñas went 4-5 at the plate and recorded four RBI's. Brad Eldred, who owns FIU's all-time homerun record at 35, hit his 20th on the year, a solo shot in the seventh. 

Hurricane starter TJ Prunty was belted by the Golden Panther bats and quickly removed from the game after FIU scored six  runs and the starter failed to record an out.

Alex Ansoleaga walked and scored on an RBI single by Solomon Frieder. Dean Adams scored off a bases-loaded walk to Hector Nuñez. Frieder scored when Adam Summerell was hit by a pitch. With the bases loaded once again, Dueñas connected with a pitch for a homerun. His double to right center field scored Eldred, Nuñez, and Summerell. 

But Miami would not go down without a fight. The Hurricanes' Danny Figueroa singled and scored after Brad Safchik tripled. Safchik came home on a single by Kevin Howard. The FIU lead had shrunk to 6-2 after the first inning. 

Miami once again chipped away at the FIU lead with two runs in the bottom of the second. Greg Dini hit a solo home run off DeCarlo and Paco Figueroa scored on a Safchik sacrifice fly. 

The Hurricanes continued to trim the lead as Jim Burt doubled and scored on a Dina RBI double in the third inning. 
Eldred added to his homerun total by hitting his 20th on the year. This gave the Golden Panthers the 7-5 lead and ended a span of 10 games without a homerun. 

Eldred needs one more to tie the single season record which was set in 1998 by Luis Fernandez. 

Derek Taylor replaced DeCarlo in the eighth. 

In the ninth, FIU added to its lead with two more runs when Duenas hit an  RBI single, once again scoring Eldred. It was Duenas' fourth RBI of the game. 

Skip Adams' RBI single brought in Summerell and gave the Golden Panthers the 9-5 lead. 

Trailing by four runs, the Hurricanes rallied with two of their own in the ninth. Danny Figueroa reached base when FIU shortstop Dennis Diaz committed an error. Figueroa would later score. Taylor walked Howard and loaded the bases with no outs. He was replaced by Arthur Santos. 
Matt Dryer knocked in Safchik when he hit a sacrifice fly. Santos struck out Danny Matienzo and got Dini on a force out at second to end the contest and secure his first save on the season. 

The win means FIU won the season series against the Hurricanes for the first time since 1999. It was also the Golden Panthers' fourth consecutive regular season win at Mark Light Stadium. 

FIU 10, Bethune-Cookman 3

FIU (32-14) ended its two-game losing streak by defeating Bethune-Cookman (34-18) 10-3 on Wednesday night. 

Michael Baluja started the game for the Golden Panthers and earned his first win since March 23rd. He improved his record to 5-3 on the year by pitching six innings and allowing three runs on five hits. Josh Banks pitched the final three innings in relief and collected his first save of the year. 

Alex Ansoleaga led off with a walk in the first and later scored on Brad Eldred's RBI single. It was Eldred's team-leading 49th RBI on the year and it gave FIU the 1-0 lead. 

For the Wildcats, Sylvannah Dean led off the second inning by stealing second and third base and then scored on a wild pitch by Baluja. 

FIU responded by scoring three runs in the fourth inning. Junior Solomon Frieder doubled to left field and scored when Adam Summerell hit a single for the go-ahead run. Summerell and Freshman Dennis Diaz scored on an error by Wildcat second baseman Pedro Pichardo committed an error. 

Summerell hit his fifth homerun for the year in the fifth inning, which gave FIU a 5-1 lead after five innings. 

In the sixth, Bethune-Cookman cut the lead to 5-3 when Alberto Meran hit a two-run single that scored Carlos Vara and Jose Vasquez. 

FIU's lead was increased to 6-3 in the seventh inning when Frieder reached on a fielder's choice and was later brought home when Diaz hit an RBI double to right field. 

Dean Adams scored in the eighth and Dueñas hit a two-run double down the left field line. Nuñez and Eldred both scored. Skip Adams scored the tenth run of the game for the Golden Panthers when the Wildcat left-fielder committed an error on a fly ball. 

It was the 23rd consecutive win against B-CC for the Golden Panthers. FIU has not lost a contest to the Wildcats since 1994.

Headline: Tennis to play Miami in NCAA's after reaching SBC semifinals
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After failing to defeat South Alabama in the Sun Belt final for the fifth straight year, the No. 25 Golden Panther tennis team received an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament, which begins May 10.

FIU will travel to Gainesville for an all-Florida regional. The Golden Panthers (18-6) will meet cross-town rival No. 32 Miami (14-6) in the opening round. Top-ranked Florida (19-1) will play Central Florida (11-11). The winners will meet the following day and the regional winner will move on to the Sweet 16 on May 16 at Stanford.

"It is really exciting to be selected again to the tournament and keep the tradition alive," head coach Ronni Bernstein said. "But its been tough the last couple of weeks waiting and we had been keeping our fingers crossed."

The reason for the waiting game came courtesy of conference rival South Alabama, who defeated FIU in the Sun Belt finals, 4-0.
South Alabama 4, FIU 0

Entering the Sun Belt Conference Tournament as the No.1 seed, FIU (18-6) exited the tournament as second best after South Alabama put an end to the Golden Panthers' hopes for the program's first Sun Belt title.

The Jaguars won the team's eleventh straight Sun Belt Tournament title with a 4-0 win over FIU.

Despite FIU's No. 40 ranked doubles team of Anneliese Rose and Cristina Campana's 8-3 win over South Alabama's Josien Boverhof and Nienke Scheltens, the Jaguars won the doubles point with wins at the No. 2 and 3 positions.

The match came down to a battle between two All-Sun Belt Conference players.

The Jaguars' Boverhof ended the match and clinched the Sun Belt title for South Alabama by defeating FIU's No. 2 player, Mei Ly.

Earlier in the season, FIU defeated South Alabama 4-3 at home to hand the Jaguars their first SBC loss in over ten years.

Rose, Campana and Ly were named to the All-Sun Belt Conference Team following the team's trip to the tournament finals.

FIU 4, New Orleans 2

The Golden Panthers advanced to the Sun Belt Championship match for the fourth consecutive year after they defeated the No. 69 New Orleans, 4-2.

FIU took two of the three doubles matches to win the doubles point.
Rose and Campana had little trouble with New Orleans' Laetitia Zembski and Lucie Mazinova 8-4 at the No.1 spot.  Maria Montoya and Rosenberg took care of Liselott Hedenberg and Inge Veerman 8-5.

The Golden Panthers secured the match with three wins in singles.

Rose defeated Patricia Osedumme 6-3, 6-3.  Campana beat Celine Azais 6-4, 7-6 and Raic took Veerman 6-2, 7-5.

The win marked FIU's eighth win this season over a ranked opponent.

FIU 4, Denver 0

FIU opened the Sun Belt Tournament with a 4-0 tune-up over the Denver Pioneers.

The Golden Panthers dominated the doubles matches.

Rose and Campana won their match over Yanikc Dullens and Barb Kowin 8-4 and Ly and Raic easily defeated Steph Ginsburg and Thomas 8-3.

FIU needed only three singles matches to clinch the first round match.Raic nearly shutout Naru Attamirano 6-0, 6-1 at the No. 5 position.

&nbsp;
FIU ended the four-game weekend Sun Belt series with Western Kentucky (37-20, 8-8 SBC) the same way it began, tied for second place in the conference.

The two teams will begin the Sun Belt Tournament against each other again at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, May 9 at the FIU Softball Stadium.

Western Kentucky 4, FIU 0

In the final game of the series, WKU's Rockie Castillo knocked out the Golden Panthers (38-32, 8-8 SBC) with her fifth shutout of the season.
Shelly Floyd delivered all the offense Castillo needed with two hits and two RBI. 

Leah Barnes (5-9) took the loss despite pitching well for FIU, allowing only one earned run in four innings of work while striking out three.

With a 2-0 lead, Floyd capped off the Hilltoppers' scoring with the fourth consecutive single off reliever Kendra Laminack that brought home two more runs to make it 4-0.

FIU leads the all-time series 9-4.

FIU 3, Western Kentucky 1

Vanessa Preston (13-10) continued her impressive pitching on the weekend by recording her second win of the series in a 3-1 FIU win.

Preston, who felt a little shoulder tendonitis earlier in the week, pitched 4.1 innings allowing one hit and struck out five.

Preston pitched 8.2 innings in the series surrendering only two earned runs and struck out seven.

Amanda Nealer again was lights out coming out of the bullpen to nail down her sixth save of the season.

Preston and Nealer gave up only four hits.

The Golden Panthers batted around in the third inning against Allison Silver (17-9) to take a 3-0 lead.

Dubovik laid down a bunt single, stole her 27th base of the season and scored on Lindsay Tippings' RBI single to put FIU on top 1-0.

After Tippings scored on an error, Jennifer Owens (2 for 4) delivered another run scoring single to make it 3-0. len's single brought home Wolter to give FIU the early lead.

WKU rallied with a four run third inning highlighted by Jessie Richardson's home run off Kendra Laminack (8-8) who took the loss.  

FIU 3, Western Kentucky 2

Relying on one of its strengths, pitching, FIU began the four game series with Western Kentucky on a high note with a narrow 3-2 victory.

Preston, Laminack and Nealer combined on the four-hitter for FIU.

Down 1-0, Owens tied it for FIU with an RBI single in the fourth and 

Sabrina Smith's fielder's choice scored Gillen to give FIU a 2-1 lead

The Hilltoppers rallied in the bottom of the fifth to close the gap to 3-2 after loading the bases and threatening to take the lead.

But as usual FIU spelled relief, N-E-A-L-E-R as Nealer struck out Melissa Gomes with the bases loaded to end the rally.

The FIU closer went on to retire six of the final seven batters she would face to record her fifth save.

Western Kentucky 7, FIU 3

The Golden Panthers out-hit the Hilltoppers 13-5, but but fell 7-3.
FIU jumped out to a 3-0 lead, but five walks by Golden Panther pitching led to the defeat.

Relying on their running game the Golden Panthers started the scoring on a double steal by Marleah Stapf and Dubovik after they each reached base on hits.

Crystal Boyer's RBI single scored Dubovik and Lesley Gil

FIU 1, FAU 0

In their six previous meetings this season with the No. 10 ranked Florida Atlantic Owls, the Golden Panthers have scored only three runs.

To get one of their biggest wins of the season, FIU needed only one run as the Golden Panthers ruined the Owls Senior Night with a 1-0 win.

Saddled with a five-game losing streak and facing anupcoming four-game Sun Belt series at Western Kentucky, the Golden Panthers (36-30) pulled out all the stops to secure the win.

Locked in a pitcher's duel with FAU's three-time All-American Nikki Myers, Leah Barnes, who had a no-hitter into the fifth, kept her composure by allowing only one hit in 5.1 innings while striking out six.

Barnes, who didn't know she was starting until the last minute when Preston came down with minor shoulder tendonitis, relished the opportunity.

"I like starting games and I'm feeling better every time I've gotten the opportunity," Barnes said.  "Starting a game builds my confidence and I feel like my old self."

Catcher Sabrina Smith helped to manufacture the game's only run with both her arm and legs.

In the top of the fifth, with Smith second base and Stephanie Wolter at the plate, the Owls had its third baseman Rhianna Rogers pulled in close to protect against the bunt.

Faced with the possibility of pinch-hitting for on-deck slap hitter Kelly Nicosia, Gwydir noticed Rogers playing in and the Owls playing with a backup shortstop in Christina Thompson.

Gwydir gave Smith, who had only one stolen base on the season, the steal sign and Smithstole thid base without a throw when Thompson got confused on whether to cover third base or not.

"With Kelly being a slap hitter, it's a lot harder to get the runner home from second base," Gywdir said.  "And I didn't want to pinch hit for her (Nicosia) with her being one of our top hitters and all.  We had a better chance to get Sabrina home if she was on third."

Smith was on third and after Wolter struck out, Nicosia, who played her freshman season at FAU, barely got a piece of Myers' drop ball and top spun an infield hit towards first base.

"I never got a good piece of the drop ball," Nicosia said.  "I mis-hit it, but a hit's a hit no matter what."

Smith scored and FIU led 1-0.

Nealer quieted the Owls in the 6th, but ran into trouble in the bottom of the 7th. FAU got a couple of runners on in the seventh and brought their leading homerun hitter Myersto the plate.Myers walked for the fourth time in the game to load the bases.   

The game came down to pinch-hitter Jessica Fernandez versus Nealer.

Nealer jumped out in front of Fernandez with two strikes before she got her swinging on a high fastball to secure the win.

Headline: Feminism hindered by myth, fear
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
We've all heard the legends: crazed feminists burn their bras in a show of protest; crazed feminists become "evil lesbians" who want to castrate men, crazed feminist lop off one breast or dress like men as a sign of defiance. Who said mythology was a lost art?  There's so much myth surrounding feminism, that to many people, spotting a feminist that defies the myth is almost like spotting a unicorn: "There she is, don't make any sudden movements.  She may bite." 

Sadly, many people I've encountered, even women, in this city of ours immediately close their minds to even the word "feminism" almost as a reflex. You can't even talk to most people about it without having them roll their eyes 40 times in the conversation.  And I always wonder why.  

Why would you decide on something you know nothing about?  Why would many refuse to even learn anything about it? Is it because their minds have already been made up for them? This is probably not too far from the truth. Social myths control people and their thoughts more than they like to think. It's a sad fact, but the easiest way to silence somebody is not to force them to be quiet, but to label them a radical.  That's all it takes.  Label a group radical, tell people they're crazy, and people will refuse to listen to them from that point on.  And it's pretty hard to spread a message without an audience.    

But to me, it's sadder still to see women who are afraid of feminism, or women who have fallen for the myths and don't want to be associated with them. 

For these women, let me dispel a few myths:  First of all, being feminist does not involve burning bras or castrating men, and it doesn't mean you have to be angry at the world every waking moment.  

Feminists don't gather under the moonlight and chant around a bonfire thanking the Goddess for the great menstrual force that unites them and reading from the great Tomb of Empowerment. They don't go around yelling at random men on the street to stop oppressing their wombs. 

It doesn't make you cold and prudish. It doesn't mean you're a lesbian, because believe it or not, wanting equal rights for women across the board has nothing to do with who you fall in love. I know many of you would say that you're open-minded and don't have a problem with homosexuality, but consider the fact that fear of being called a lesbian still keeps many women from ascribing to feminism.  

Why would so many people who are supposedly okay with it, especially people confident with their own sexuality, fear it?  

The fact is that the same thing happens with feminism. There's no reason to fear it, yet people do. Where do these fears come from? Who or what instilled them in you? 

If I'm throwing out a lot of questions, it's to give you a taste of what feminism is all about.  One of those things is questioning. It doesn't mean you have to stop being "feminine;" it means you stop and think about what femininity is in the first place. 

The fact of the matter is that most women ascribe to feminist ideals and don't even know it.  If you think I'm way off here, consider these questions: Have you ever been thankful that you have the right to vote (even though many don't utilize it)? 

Have you ever used birth control or considered using it? Are you thankful to be going to school and to have job opportunities when you graduate? Would you like those opportunities to be greater and fair? 

Does it bother you that a woman is raped approximately every 45 seconds (and think about how much more would be done if men where the ones getting raped every 45 seconds)? Do you ever think about how terrible the situation must be for women in places like Afghanistan? 

Call me crazy, but I think if you think about it this way, feminism may not be as radical as many might think. 

So, consider these questions the next time somebody mentions feminism and you go running for the hills.  

Don't join the villagers lighting torches and brandishing pitchforks and talk to us.  Trust me, we don't bite – usually.

Headline: In Our View: Engineering students to benefit from building change
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Two months ago, Dean Vish Prasad and the students at the College of Engineering let the administration and the other students at FIU know about the conditions they had to put up with at their off campus building.

The Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences, located at the corner of Flagler St. and 107th Ave., is the home for the college and lacks some of the refinements the students at University Park and Biscayne Bay know all too well.

Engineering students complained of a lack of study areas,  of a lack of variety in the food choices in their cafeteria, of the difficulty they experience in trying to enter and exit the campus during Miami-Dade's infamous rush hours, paralyzing traffic on the two main arteries feeding CEAS.

Two months after their complaints were made public, the university's soon-to-be engineers are getting the help they wanted.  They already enjoy a breakfast menu at their cafeteria, and plans are already in the works for study halls and a traffic light at Flagler St. and SW 105. Ave. to let them get to and from home with greater ease.

Promises have also been made to engineering students to help advertise campus life related events on bulletin boards in CEAS and designing pamphlets to let engineers know of other FIU programs.

While the administration must be commended for acting on the complaints of the dean and the students, they should have realized these problems were there earlier.

A simple drive down 107th Ave. would have made the traffic concerns clear, a lunch visit would have shown them their limited choices and would have showed them how few study areas engineering students have.

To avoid problems like these from accumulating over the years, the administration should stay in touch with students.

Headline: Societal ideas on beauty too centered on body
Author: Lena Hansen
&nbsp;
Beauty seems to be a requirement for success nowadays. Image is often seen as important – more so – than talent. Beautiful women and men rule the fashion and entertainment world. We are bombarded with the ideal of beauty everywhere we look: on sultry magazine covers, on television, on giant billboards, on the bottle of a body lotion or hair product – even on the streets. But what is beauty and who is to judge it? Is it only skin deep or does it go beyond physical appearance? 

The fact is, there are many different kinds of beauty. Mother Theresa's was very different from a Victoria Secret model, and yet no one can deny her inner beauty. Singer Macy Gray may not fit everyone's notion of a supermodel, but her incredible voice and radiant smile are enough to snatch our attention. Our ideal of beauty has changed throughout the years and has adapted to fit our current standards of living. If we were still upholding Greek principles, someone with perfectly chiseled features like Angelina Jolie would be at the top of our worshipping list. The voluptuous Marilyn Monroe – a size 14 – was idolized as the ultimate mold of beauty in the '50s, when excess and indulgence were not only allowed, but also revered. 

However, "The skinnier the better" seems to be the motto of the new millennium. Outrageous sizes like zero and two rule the runways and movie screens, making Jennifer Aniston a mold of perfection.

But is beauty simply about bust sizes and waist measurements or is it more about personal style and confidence? If beauty is sometimes difficult to define, sex appeal is even more challenging to put into words. Some people have that "je ne sais quoi" that can drive anyone within their square-mile-radius completely mad. 

Lenny Kravitz is the perfect example. His in-your-face sense of style, deep voice and bohemian attitude make him an instant chick magnet. He is not your typical Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt 'pretty boy' blessed with flawless genetics, but his charisma lingers over him like a magnetic aura. So can beauty really be judged or ranked from one to 10? 

Magazines like "People" have attempted to achieve the impossible with their "Most Beautiful" celebrity lists. Askmen.com, a racy website, also came up with their infamous "50 Most Beautiful Women" list. As usual, Latin beauties rocked the charts. Surprisingly, Jennifer López – the girl with the world's most famous "asset" – did not even make the top 20. She came in at 45, something that many of her fans would argue against. 

Her rival, Salma Hayek, the spicy Mexican actress, beat her at this race, coming in at 38 on the list. Other Latin sirens included on the list were Cameron Diaz at 43 and Victoria Secret model Laeticia Casta, who was crowned as the "most beautiful," winning the coveted top spot on the list. 

We may not agree with all the ratings, but as the saying goes "beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder." Sadly, It's still a man's world, and unfortunately beauty is many times (mis)judged by shallow standards and measured by inches instead of allure.

Headline: Gracie's grill pond  polluted cesspool
Author: Javier Ruiz
&nbsp;
So, did you know that the Gracies's Grill pond resides on the corner of Camilo and Ponce de Leon in Coral Gables?  Neither did I, but it does according to the concrete street corner sign beached on the shore of the pond. There's a stray street sign in it. Yeah, that's how filthy that pond is. 

I remember a time when I sat with my friends and drank beers in the sweltering Miami heat and argued about books and movies, and Greeks. 

Back then you could almost see through some of that water, and gaze on the ghostly wonders of The Beacon issues past and random articles of furniture at the bottom of that pond.  In those days I thought to myself "Jesus, that is filthy!"  

Today, I saw a turtle peek its head out of the surface before submerging again.  It disappeared from view after diving only 6 inches deep.  Six inches.  I could see bubbles rising from below, where I assume other turtles might have been.  But it might have been an alligator for all I know.  I sure couldn't see that far down.  That's how filthy that pond is. 

Relatively speaking, the Gracie's pond of my freshmen year – three years ago – seemed a crystalline, white sanded beach, complete with Hawaiian Tropic models.  I'd have drunk that water compared to this muck.  

It's not even water anymore.  It's mud. It's greener than our lovely football field.  And it looks about as solid. What effort those turtles and ducklings must exert to break the surface tension of that swill. 

The building of the adjacent bookstore expansion has resulted in all kinds of Styrofoam and cardboard materials drifting into the pond.  Now, I don't work for the EPA, and I'm not a member of Greenpeace, but that cannot be good for whatever lives in there.  That much has to be obvious.  

But I won't go down that route too far.  It's a road too easily traveled, that whole tree-hugger argument.  I'm definitely not one to harp on environmentalism – I am after all, a shallow Miamian. But, let's be honest: it looks nauseating. 

There is a layer of what appears to be – at least in my unprofessional opinion – sewage.  I'm not saying that it is sewage, and I'm not so sure that I really want to know what it is, but that's what it looks like, It's, well for lack of a better word, gross.

It seems to me an inconsistency of logic that we have a "nature preserve" on this campus, and yet we allow the condition of a very visible pond deteriorate to this.  Isn't it somebody's responsibility to look after these things?  

I'd like to personally invite President Maidique for a beer at Gracie's on the condition that he checks out this pond.  Oh, remember to bring ID, 'cause I'm not 21 until August.  How's that sound?

Headline: Council organizes Hispanic clubs
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Last fall, the Student Organization Council at the University Park Campus decided to make a few changes in the way it is organized. As a result, three new committees were created within SOC. A Sports Committee, Engineering Student Council and Hispanic Organizations Council will now help UP clubs to improve the way they are organized and the way they operate.

In its two-semester existence, the Hispanic Organizations Council run by Omar Castillo has already helped strengthen the Hispanic clubs at the campus, something SOC Vice Chair Samir Qureshi believes is important.

"We wanted Hispanic clubs to work together and become a powerful entity on campus," he said.

Although HOC has helped out with a few events these past two semesters, Qureshi expects HOC's involvement to improve. 

"It'll be even smoother next year," he said. "Omar has done a great job so far. He laid the ground work and wrote the mission statement."

Castillo said he and some other students came up with the idea for an organization like HOC after attending a Hispanic leadership conference in Chicago, Ill.

"Student Hispanic organizations from across the United States were there," Castillo said. "We realized we don't have a single group to represent and tie up Hispanic clubs."

Castillo said HOC's main goal was not to take over the university's Hispanic clubs.

"We don't want to become a club," he said. "We want Hispanic clubs to improve and unite."

Castillo wants to help give the clubs a more powerful role and presence at university events.

"Our goal is to improve attendance and help clubs get organized," he said. "We're giving them as much help as we can by helping sponsor their events."

The Colombian Student Association, known as COLSA, has already received help from HOC.

"We brought a conference on Hispanic literature and HOC helped us with these events," COLSA President Luis Carlos Moreno said.
With HOC's help, Moreno said COLSA also participated in last spring's Culture Fest.

"We organized Latin American Day in the Spring Culture Fest," Castillo said. "It's all about representing clubs instead of being the actor."

Castillo said Latin American Day was originally set up to celebrate Hispanic culture from Central and South America. HOC felt clubs representing students from Hispanic islands in the Caribbean Sea were being left out and got them involved.

BOMBA, the Puerto Rican student group and the Dominican American Student Organization later joined. "The main thing we did was the Spring Culture Fest," BOMBA President Luisa Ramos said. 

She said HOC is quite beneficial for Hispanic clubs such as BOMBA.
"BOMBA itself was very small," Ramos said. "I wanted HOC to get involved so we can have our name out there."

Castillo said these past two semesters have been about getting HOC organized and letting the clubs know about the resources available for them and how they can take advantage of them. He plans on letting clubs know how to advertise in the university's student media outlets and how they can volunteer.

"We'll have a closer relationship with clubs, reminding them when their paperwork is due and getting them points to get funding," Castillo said.
So far, HOC has had what Castillo calls a "supportive role."

"We've sponsored the leadership conference in Chicago, two COLSA events, helped some organizations get involved with Hispanic Heritage and Spring Culture Fest events," he said. "We've increased communications between clubs and have created an e-mail list."

HOC is able to provide support for conferences and club events with the help of a $1,000 stipend from its parent group, SOC.

"In the spring we spent $800 that went to the clubs," Castillo said. "At least three of four clubs benefited from the money."

The bulk of the funds were spent during the spring semester because the group spent the fall semester getting organized and prepared to take over its duties in the spring. Getting more money from SOC depends on the clubs that fall under HOC.

"I don't expect an increase," Castillo said. "We might get it since you have more clubs joining right now. If we need more, SOC is going to be willing to help."

Moreno, who will leave his post at COLSA this semester to become the new HOC chair, sees HOC becoming much more active.

"We want to unite Hispanic organizations and try to get more cultures involved like Mexican and Chilean cultures," Moreno said. "[HOC will] make Hispanic organizations more involved in campus life so they can show their richness of culture."

Moreno plans on highlighting the cultures and clubs who have gotten little exposure so far.

"We should do more about Mexican culture," he said.

Moreno also wants more exposure for BOMBA.

Castillo shares Moreno's outlook for HOC's future.

"We want to make [all clubs] strong and active," he said. "HOC will help clubs have more representation and more active members."

Headline: New vice president, Castillo takes circuitous route to FIU
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
From the Dominican Republic to France to Miami. That was the unusual route student government's new vice president, Omar Castillo, took to get to FIU.

After graduating from high school in the Dominican Republic at the age of 16 back in 1998, Omar took part in a study abroad program that took him to Paris.

"Paris is in another state of mind from the United States," he said. "It was a whole process of adaptation."

Knowing only how to speak Spanish and English when he arrived in the City of Lights, Omar said he wouldn't go anywhere without his pocket dictionary.

"It's not easy to establish yourself in another country," he said. "That's why I associate with international students.

"It's not only a language barrier but a cultural barrier you face as well," Omar said of having to get used to life abroad. "The  first month is a blank. School is in French, television is in French and they even speak to you in French at the restaurants."

The key to adjusting was to accept and absorb France's culture. That would no doubt help him assimilate to life in Miami when he moved here two years ago.

Omar, now 20, says college life in the United States is different than what he got a taste of at the Dominican Republic.

"In the Dominican Republic, you go to class, you meet your friends, you go back to class and then you meet them again outside," he said of his one month experience at a Dominican Republic college. "Here you have everything, you have so many experiences."

One of the places where Omar chose to get involved was student government. Last year, he won a seat as a lower division representative. He earned the second-highest number of votes for the position, edging out seven other candidates.

After just one year, he decided to take the opportunity to run for vice president after  Jessica Morfi asked him to be her running mate.

"It wasn't a shock, but I wasn't expecting on running for president or vice president this time," Omar said.

Omar said he wanted to run for the right reasons, not just for the sake of running for the position.

"[Being vice president] is a great opportunity to make an impact at FIU," he said of his reason for running. "I had something to offer as a student and as an individual."

At the end of April, he and Morffi were declared the winners. They both took office yesterday.

Omar expects this year to be exciting, not something he would fear because of his year of student government experience. "We're going in and we'll have everything set up," he said.

Last week, Omar and Morffi were busy planning the transition between administrations so they could "become effective sooner rather than later."

He also chose to get involved in the Student Alumni Association. He is an executive vice president with  SAA.

His main role has been in trying to get more students to join the Student Alumni Association.

Early in the spring semester, the association organized a trip to Tallahasse to thank state legislators for the things they have gotten for the university.

"It was a real interesting experience and a great opportunity to speak to the representatives," Omar said. "We think in Tallahassee they don't care about FIU but they know FIU and they care."

Along with SAA, Omar has been trying to drum up support among students and alumni for the football team, which makes its debut in the fall.

Omar is planning on getting a degree in industrial engineering, a field he thinks will make the best of his natural abilities.

"I'm more of an analyst, a strategist," he said. "I'm more of a thinker. [Industrial engineering] is not that hardcore. It combines the science aspect and the management aspect."

Omar is convinced these two aspects of industrial engineering will lead to numerous job opportunities spanning different career fields.

"It's more open, I can work as a manager in a hospital or Lockheed Martin," he said.

Engineering isn't his only passion. Throughout his life, Omar has also fallen in love with international relations.

"[After coming to America], I had doubts about studying engineering because I wanted to study international relations," Omar said.

In the Dominican Republic, Omar said international relations and politics were majors people would choose if their families were well off. Others would take classes that would help them run and improve their family businesses.

After graduation, Omar sees himself working for a multi-national corporation if he can't land a job with the government.

"My dream job is at the Central Intelligence Agency – not being a spy, just analyzing data," he said.

No matter what, Omar says "I'll stay into politics. I'm real people-oriented."

Headline: Improving conditions at the College of Engineering
Subheadline: Changes already underway
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In recent months the future of FIU's College of Engineering has consistently brightened, College of Engineering Dean Vish Prasad said, citing plans for carpet and lighting replacement inside the college's off-campus building at Flagler St. and SW 107th Ave. and a traffic light right outside. 

Many plans for changes in the building are underway and once completed, they will be visible everywhere from the landscaping to the Engineering Information Center, a center designed exclusively for students, located on the second floor. 

The EIC houses over 150 computers available for student use. 
They, among other things, help students and faculty using the center install software, introduce new students to FIU's e-mail system and work on  3-D visualization and animation projects.

These changes will be facilitated by the help of two university officials, Provost Mark Rosenburg and Executive Vice President of Business and Finance Paul Gallagher. 

Over the past two months, Prasad has met several times with Rosenberg and Gallagher. Together, they discussed starting and eventually accelerating the rate at which the changes in the college will come about.

For starters, a much-needed traffic light will be installed on the corner of  SW 105th Ave. and Flagler St. Virtually everyone associated with the school is anxiously awaiting the arrival of this light since the traffic problem in and around the school is currently so problematic, Prasad said.

"Because we must deal with [Miami-Dade] county, I don't want to estimate how long it will take," he said.

In addition to the light, decisions about the traffic pattern and design will be made in order to make driving in and around the school easier and safer for everyone. 

Gallagher is heading up a team of administrators to plan the landscaping around the building, Prasad said. The essence of their plan focuses on coordination: first changes will be made to  improve the appearance of the west side of the building, then they will come to the south side. 

The lobby of the building is set to be completely reconditioned. The colors of the walls as well as the lighting will be changed. The security officer will be moved to the back and a receptionist will soon be hired to greet and direct visitors as they enter the building. 

In addition to improving the landscaping and traffic lights, Prasad wants to improve engineering student life: Plans for student lounges and study areas are currently in the works, as are plans for design labs in all six of the college's departments. 

"These labs will take a few months to complete," Prasad said.   

Computers are a particularly useful asset for engineering students.
Because of the nature of their work, "engineering students need to use computers much more often than than the others," Prasad said.

One feature of the College of Engineering that especially caters to this need is the Engineering Information Center, located on the second floor. 
 Prasad plans to replace the carpeting in this area and in the electrical engineering department as well. 

The College of Engineering, is a wireless building, Prasad said, which makes it the architectural equivalent of a cellular phone. 

"This provides engineering students with the unique oppurtunity of using desktop and laptop computers freely," he said. "No other campus-affiliated building is fully equipped with this feature."

The dining area, a previous cause for complaint at the school, has been considerably improved, Prasad said. In the past, students and faculty complained about the lack of choice. The cafeteria staff is currently trying to expand the menu and has already begun serving breakfast.

In addition to these physical problems, one of the major issues concerning Prasad and the rest of the College is their lack of inclusion in campus life around the rest of the university, due mainly to their location a few blocks north of rather than on, the University Park campus. 

Along with Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia Telles-Irvin, Dean Prasad has been brainstorming ways to overcome this problem.

Two potential remedies they've come up with so far include bulletin boards announcing upcoming events around the rest of the University and brochures on  programs engineering students might otherwise not hear about. 

Some problems have already been fixed. When the building was first purchased, linoleum had been placed on  the west side stairs to prevent people from falling over. However, with the passage of time, this linoleum slowly wore away making people once again prone to slipping. Recently, it was repaired.

Prasad's outlook on the College's situation is optimistic. While many of these changes will not occur overnight, he notes that some,  such as the west side stairs, are already visible. The support of high-ranking University officials helps the process along as well. 

"[President] Modesto Madique has shown great interest in improving the academic life of engineering students," Prasad said. 

The dean's sincerity in his willingness to help has been acknowledged by the Engineering Student Council, an umbrella overlooking twenty student engineering societies. Last month, they awarded him a plaque in recognition of his support and dedication to engineering students and the Student Council. 

This year for the first time in the school's history, students in various departments will be recognized for their efforts, academic and otherwise.
Awards will be given to the most outstanding students in the areas of civil engineering, construction management, electrical engineering, computer engineering, industrial and systems engineering, mechanical engineering, outstanding Master graduate, Ph.D. graduate and community service.

Headline: Tennis to play Miami in NCAA's after reaching SBC semifinals
Author: Robert Sens / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
After failing to defeat South Alabama in the Sun Belt final for the fifth straight year, the No. 25 Golden Panther tennis team received an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament, which begins May 10.

FIU will travel to Gainesville for an all-Florida regional. The Golden Panthers (18-6) will meet cross-town rival No. 32 Miami (14-6) in the opening round. Top-ranked Florida (19-1) will play Central Florida (11-11). The winners will meet the following day and the regional winner will move on to the Sweet 16 on May 16 at Stanford.

"It is really exciting to be selected again to the tournament and keep the tradition alive," head coach Ronni Bernstein said. "But its been tough the last couple of weeks waiting and we had been keeping our fingers crossed."

The reason for the waiting game came courtesy of conference rival South Alabama, who defeated FIU in the Sun Belt finals, 4-0.
South Alabama 4, FIU 0

Entering the Sun Belt Conference Tournament as the No.1 seed, FIU (18-6) exited the tournament as second best after South Alabama put an end to the Golden Panthers' hopes for the program's first Sun Belt title.

The Jaguars won the team's eleventh straight Sun Belt Tournament title with a 4-0 win over FIU.

Despite FIU's No. 40 ranked doubles team of Anneliese Rose and Cristina Campana's 8-3 win over South Alabama's Josien Boverhof and Nienke Scheltens, the Jaguars won the doubles point with wins at the No. 2 and 3 positions.

South Alabama continued its domination of FIU with a sweep of the singles matches.

Dominika Nemcovicova defeated Dominique Rosenberg 7-5, 6-1 at the No. 6 position.

Andrea Kusekova defeated Marina Raic 6-3, 6-1.

The match came down to a battle between two All-Sun Belt Conference players.

The Jaguars' Boverhof ended the match and clinched the Sun Belt title for South Alabama by defeating FIU's No. 2 player, Mei Ly.

Earlier in the season, FIU defeated South Alabama 4-3 at home to hand the Jaguars their first SBC loss in over ten years.

Rose, Campana and Ly were named to the All-Sun Belt Conference Team following the team's trip to the tournament finals.

FIU 4, New Orleans 2

The Golden Panthers advanced to the Sun Belt Championship match for the fourth consecutive year after they defeated the No. 69 New Orleans, 4-2.

FIU took two of the three doubles matches to win the doubles point.
Rose and Campana had little trouble with New Orleans' Laetitia Zembski and Lucie Mazinova 8-4 at the No.1 spot.  Maria Montoya and Rosenberg took care of Liselott Hedenberg and Inge Veerman 8-5.

The Golden Panthers secured the match with three wins in singles.
Rose defeated Patricia Osedumme 6-3, 6-3.  Campana beat Celine Azais 6-4, 7-6 and Raic took Veerman 6-2, 7-5.
The win marked FIU's eighth win this season over a ranked opponent.

FIU 4, Denver 0

FIU opened the Sun Belt Tournament with a 4-0 tune-up over the Denver Pioneers.

The Golden Panthers dominated the doubles matches.

Rose and Campana won their match over Yanikc Dullens and Barb Kowin 8-4 and Ly and Raic easily defeated Steph Ginsburg and Thomas 8-3.

FIU needed only three singles matches to clinch the first round match.Raic nearly shutout Naru Attamirano 6-0, 6-1 at the No. 5 position. 
Montoya defeated Ginsburg at No. 3 and Campana sealed the match with a win over Elizabeth Matthews.

Headline: Refreshing "Marce" bares soul
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
In a world of music dominated by studio-produced shams constantly forced down our throats, FIU's own Marcela Piñeros' first album, Marce, is a refreshing reminder of what true talent really is.  Like Jewel's debut Pieces of You, Marce is a collection of soulful folk ballads suffused with an underdog charm.  Substituting big studio glitter with raw talent, Piñeros puts together a solid album that reminds us why the independent music industry merits our support. (The album is available only through her site, www.marcesmusic.com.)

The twelve tracks consist mostly of vocals and guitar and demonstrate Piñeros' innate lyrical ability that despite an impressive debut, seems to have only broken the surface. "Imperfection," "The Critic's Song" and "Drowning in a Tear Drop," a one and half minute flash of precocious folk wisdom ("sitting high on the edge of madness/don't look up cause the sun will blind you"), are each self-reflective ballads with a somewhat conversational structure reminiscent of the almost rambling sagacity of Ani Difranco.  

In "D is for Denial," Piñeros deals with the issue of domestic violence and manages to pull off the use of the alphabet theme without sounding childish by coupling it with a good melody and poetic lyrics like: "In a dimly lit room you see her stripped down to the truth/Playing songs on a stringless guitar that reminds her of her youth." Rather than seeming sensationalist, the song creates an interesting parallel between domestic violence and stifled youth.  

Staying true to her folk style, Piñeros' becomes an avid storyteller in many of the songs, including "Lunch" and "Anyway" which are each brief tales of love &#8211; finding it, losing it, and all the baggage in between.  

Although not perfect (an idea which Piñeros seems to have no qualms about if the song "Imperfection" is any indication), Marce is an impressive debut and display of musical talent. But it's the fact that the album is not perfect that gives it so much of its charm.  We're so surrounded by packaged "artists" that we try to perfect someone until they become nothing but a shell of marketing tactics. Marcela Piñeros is not a packaged performer and Marce is no one else's but her own. It's refreshing to see someone take a chance and bare herself, her talents and her imperfections, so fully and sincerely that we can lose ourselves in something real and filled with the kind of hope that reminds us that anything is possible.

Headline: "Hollywood Ending" stumbles blindly
Author: Hansel Castro / Arts Editor
&nbsp;
Twenty-some years ago, when Woody Allen was romancing Diane Keaton in "Annie Hall," you couldn't quite shake the feeling that maybe she was a little out of his league. Let's face it: even when he was young and sprightly, Allen looked old and wizened. Now that he's really old and wizened, he looks like he should be given the titular role in "The Mummy 3," which makes it that much harder to believe that Tea Leoni, Debra Messing and Tiffani Amber-Thiessen would be fighting for his affection as they do in his latest comedy, "Hollywood Ending." Apparently, Allen is on something far more powerful than Viagra: self delusion.

Woody Allen plays, well, Woody Allen, the only role he's ever been able to pull off. This time around he goes by the name of Val Waxman. Val is an aging director in love with New York who has seen better days, knows it, but is deeply afraid of giving in to Hollywood demands. (Can you say "self-reflexive?") He is so close to hitting rock bottom that the most promising job in his future is a geriatric diaper commercial, so when producers Hal (Treat Williams) and Ellie (Tea Leoni) propose he direct a New York period drama called "The City that Never Sleeps," Val jumps at the prospect, even though Ellie is his ex-wife and Hal is the smooth Hollywood player that wrestled her from his side. Of course, Val's hardly mature about the subject and when he snarls at Ellie and says things like: "How could you leave me for him?" one feels tempted to say: "Well, for one thing, Hal doesn't look like he belongs in a taxidermy lab."
Forty-five minutes into the movie, and just before entering production of "The City that Never Sleeps," Val goes psychosomatically blind.
 
Ordinarily, this would be unforgivably late for introducing the movie's main joke, but "Hollywood Ending" meanders so much after those 45 minutes that it doesn't even matter; it still feels like an eternity before it ends. It's not that the movie is slowly paced, but rather that it's so poorly plotted that it feels like a New York City cab ride: You're not sure where the driver is taking you, and you can't understand a word he's saying anyway.

Can you grasp the irony? A movie about a director who's lost his vision made by a director who's lost his vision.Val tries to bluff it through the production of his movie, aided first by his agent Al (Mark Rydell) and then Ellie. He manages to drop his ditzy girlfriend, Lori (Messing), reject the advances of his main star, Sharon (Thiessen), and re-ignite the flames with Ellie, all this while blind. Even Val's estranged son (Mark Webber), a mock rocker who goes by the name of Scumbag X, sarcastically points out the obviousness of the plot device: "Blindness as metaphor. Great." 

Maybe I was supposed to care about the differences between Val and his son, (a subplot the movie barely lingers on and  is ironically the only relationship that feels real in the entire movie), but it was hard because I couldn't get past the fact that the three main male characters in the film are called Al, Hal and Val, and no one pointed it out at any moment. It's not used for comedic effect. There isn't even a funny scene where Al, Hal and Val converge and are introduced to each other. Nothing at all. It's like the set up to a joke that never comes, and it's infuriatingly lazy and careless.

I'm a big fan of Allen's work. Why bother denying it? I enjoyed most of "Hollywood Ending," chuckled at the inside jokes, smirked at the Hollywood jokes, laughed out-loud at the slapstick, but I also looked at my watch too many times, and winced whenever Allen groped younger co-stars. Ultimately, I was left disappointed, and a little sad, because even the good lines feel recycled from better work, like Allen's comments on masturbation: "What I like best about masturbation is all the cuddling right after." I can't quite anticipate his next project with the same optimism I once used to. Just like Woody Allen's character, "Hollywood Ending" bumps into walls but pretends everything is all right and it can find its way around. Sadly, it can't.

Headline: Graphic "Deuces Wild" revisits '50s gangs
Author: Joe Martel
&nbsp;
How many times have the youth of today heard their grandparents, the youth of yesterday, talk about the so-called good old days? They always say it was a better time for people to live in, that crime wasn't as rampant as it is now and gangs weren't as dangerous. I don't know who those people are, but one thing's for sure: They didn't grow up in Brooklyn. In "Deuces Wild," director Scott Kalvert ("The Basketball Diaries") shows us just how bad the good old days could get, especially with the gangs. It encompasses all the characteristics of classic gang movies such as "West Side Story,' "Rebel Without A Cause" and "The Outsiders," except the language and violence aren't as tame. This makes the film seem more realistic and worth watching.

The year is 1958. Elvis Priestly trims down his signature hairstyle for the army, the Dodgers pack up and leave for the city of angels and street gangs are as commonplace as malt milkshakes at drive-in movies. One of these gangs is a bunch of tough hoodlums from Brooklyn called the Deuces. Even though they're always causing problems and breaking the law, they're still the good guys. They protect their block with bats, knives, brass knuckles and a glare in their eye that would knock James Dean right off his motorcycle. They even have their own little mascot: a scrawny kid that calls himself Scooch (Frankie Muniz) who admires and looks up to them. Their top priority is to keep drugs out of their neighborhood. This is because, three years ago, their leader Leon Anthony (Stephen Dorff) lost his brother to an overdose. The drugs were supplied by Marco Vendetti (Norman Reedus), the head of a rival neighborhood gang called the Vipers. Compared to the Vipers, the Deuces are the lesser of two evils. Marco is caught and sent to prison right after, so he figures that it was Leon who turned him in.

Without Marco around, the neighborhood is a lot quieter. The Deuces and the Vipers still hate each other, but they have a truce and honor it as long as everybody stays in their place. The situation is relatively peaceful, until the local gangster, Fritzy (Matt Dillon) decides to open up a drug house on the block. What's more, he hires Marco, who just got released, to run it. This does not make Leon a happy man, but the Deuces and Fritzy's gang have been on good terms so far and if he tries anything, he'll start a war. To make matters worse, Marco and the Vipers keep provoking the Deuces by picking fights, destroying the neighborhood, and even threatening their loved ones. Leon tries to convince his gang not to loose their cool, but the Vipers don't make it easy. As if there aren't enough problems for Leon to deal with, Leon's other brother, Bobby (Brad Renfro) has fallen in love with a sassy little minx named Annie the Ice Cube (Fairuza Balk). This wouldn't be a bad thing, except for the fact that she's the sister of one of the Vipers. I smell another "West Side Story" rip-off. Father Aldo (Vincent Pastore), the local priest and Leon's friend, tells him to make peace with the Vipers before things get too out of control. Unfortunately, by then, the situation is well out of his hands and anything can happen.

Although it's not the best movie about gangs in the 50's, "Deuces Wild" gives a more accurate depiction than the average. For instance, the fight scenes are more graphic. When someone is getting the crap beaten out of him, the hits look and sound very real. Plus, when the fight is over, everyone is either cut, bruised, covered in blood, or all three &#8211; something not commonly found in the classics. 

Another difference is the use of vulgarity. When I first saw old movies that portrayed gangs as a kid, I noticed that even though they acted violently, none of them cursed. I assumed that that's how the gangs behaved back then, that they somehow managed to keep their mouths clean. I later found out it was just the censors keeping the scripts clean. 

The only part of the movie that was hard to believe was Vincent Pastore's character. It's difficult to picture a guy who plays a gangster named "Big Pussy" on "The Sopranos" as a Catholic priest. It just doesn't seem right. Otherwise, the film was fairly decent.

Headline: FIU honors playwright
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
With the opening of  "Fall of the Amazons" at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, more than a few preparations were made for what promised to be a huge event. FIU added this last play to its season in honor of the play's translator, Eric Bentley, who was receiving an honorary degree from FIU. 

The grand finale of this massive event came as Bentley himself visited FIU, straight from New York City, in order to attend the production and receive his degree. Bentley arrived in Miami Saturday, attended that evening's performance, and then gave a lecture on Sunday – after which there was a ceremony recognizing Bentley, as well as certain performers from FIU's production. Monday was the commencement exercises at which Bentley received his honorary degree. The 85-year-old writer has an extensive resume, with accomplishments ranging from original plays ("Lord Alfred's Lover") to critical analyses to books ("The Playwright as A Thinker") and much more. 
 
"Fall of the Amazons," is one-fourth of what Bentley calls the "Kleist Variations." "Variations" is a quartet of plays written in German by Heinrich Von Kleist. Bentley was working in the University Theatre of the State of New York in Buffalo when they asked him to translate these four plays into English. Verbatim, the translations would not have been clear, so Bentley took a bit of literary license with his translating – making the plays his own. 

Bertolt Brecht is one of the individuals who significantly shaped Bentley into the icon he is today. Bentley trained under Brecht as a fledging in the theatre business, and he has always greatly admired the playwright and his compositions. 

"I don't attempt to imitate his plays or follow his theories, but his impact upon me was great; it was the influence of a personality and a method of work," explained Bentley. 

Theatre has always been a massive part of Bentley's life; he is extremely passionate about the genre and feels that it needs to be an even larger part of society – especially today when "we live in an age where you don't meet with live theatre much – we meet with television."  
Bentley holds a strong opinion about television and the media. He feels that this generation is led too quickly by what is seen on our sets. Bentley advises that people should "not be drawn in so easily –we are surrounded today by talking heads; they tell us what to think and what to do." He suggests that society not give them as much attention as they are demanding, but try to have "independence and some distance from it. Have your own opinion, don't go with the masses." 

Bentley is "very flattered" with the honorary degree that FIU is bestowing upon him. After accomplishing so much already, he would now like to not only write another play, but also continue the work he is doing with the university's Associate Professor of Theatre and Dance, Phillip Church. 
When asked if Bentley possibly carried any regrets about his life, he turned to an element of theatre, yet again, for his answer: music. He spoke of the French song "Je Ne Regrette Rien" ("No Regrets.") He explained that, in one mood, he could certainly follow this spirit of bravery and pride – a spirit that is not unlike that of Frank Sinatra's ballad, "My Way," another favorite. 
 
However, in another mood, he could criticize his life in two ways: "I was not always smart, I did not always make the right decisions; and then, on moral grounds, I could have behaved better at times, or done things differently."  However, he feels that "dwelling on our regrets can be quite dangerous, psychologically." This is how Bentley lives his life – he goes on with the acceptance of every part of living and uses his experiences as lessons. Live your life, do the best you can, and never be ashamed of saying "I did it my way.."

Headline: "Spider-man" spins exciting web
Author: Jennifer Mosconi
&nbsp;
I have a confession to make. I'm a comic book dork. Therefore, my review of "Spider-man" may be slightly biased because I'm so glad to see it come to the screen after ten years of attempts. It was almost made by James Cameron in 1992, but now Sam Raimi ("The Evil Dead") serves as director, serving up a wonderful blend of live-action and CGI that ties together the different comic book versions of Spiderman that have popped up over the years.

The movie starts as the comic book does. We see Tobey Maguire, in a brilliant casting job as Peter Parker, abused nerd. He makes it through high school, where he is bitten by a spider and becomes Spider-man. Maguire does a fabulous job of portraying the insecurities of Peter Parker and the quick wit of Spider-man. Mary Jane, the love of Peter Parker's life, is played by Kirsten Dunst, in the worst casting job of the movie. When Mary Jane tells Peter that a director told her she needed acting lessons, we have to wonder if this isn't a tale taken directly from Kirsten's life. Her horrid acting is  one of the few dark spots in an otherwise bright movie. 

Other casting highlights include James Franco as Peter's best friend Harry Osborn, and J.K. Simmons as J.J. Jameson, Peter's gruff boss at the Daily Bugle. Although all the actors in the film, with the exception of Kirsten Dunst, are brilliant, they are all outshined by Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn (A.K.A. the Green Goblin). Dafoe as the Green Goblin wears a hard plastic mask that leaves only his eyes visible, but is such a brilliant actor that he's able to emote through his eyes, and his body language. He fits the role so perfectly that I cannot imagine that they thought of anyone else for it.

Exceptional casting cannot always aid the dialogue that occasionally slips into pure cheesiness, for example, the line "Goblin, how could you?" should have been thrown out, very early on. The best scenes are the ones in which the Green Goblin and Spider-man face off. CGI is very easy to overdo, and certain parts of the movie look pretty fake, but that just makes it look more like a comic book brought to life.

Certain items are changed from the comic book versions, but most of the changes are small, and fit in better with the film. Despite the arguments over the organic web shooters, Raimi has achieved what seemed like an impossible goal until "X-Men." He created a movie that can be loved as much by comic book fans as by ordinary people. Like "X-Men," "Spider-man" includes some small inside jokes for the loyal fan boys and girls, but not so many that the average movie-goer would feel left out. Raimi left some loose ends, but the movie is obviously going to be part of a profitable franchise that will at some point tie those up. If you are completely against comic books movies, and refuse to see "Spider-man" on principle, my advice is simple: Go to see this at least once, watch "X-Men" and hopefully they will erase memories of "Batman & Robin" (along with the idea that comic book movies are crap), right out of your head.

Headline: Ley de Dios versus ley del hombre
Subheadline: Alberto Luis Rivera Rullán
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Sultaana Freeman es una mujer estadounidense, residente en Orlando y que hace varios años decidió convertirse al Islam.  Como muchas otras mujeres musulmanas, Freeman utiliza una bufanda que le cubre su rostro.  Según Chukri, imam (líder de oración) en una mezquita de North Miami Beach, esta especie de velo es un ejemplo de la modestia que exige su religión y una opción que algunas musulmanas toman para protegerse de los males que la rodean.  &#8220;Al tener su cuerpo (incluyendo la cara) cubierto, logran que las conozcan y las valoren por su ser y no por su físico.&#8221;

Existen diferentes estilos de bufandas.  Algunas musulmanas utilizan el hijab,  que cubre la cabeza, los lados de la cara y el cuello pero permite que se vea el rostro.  Otras, como Freeman, visten el niqab con el que sólo se pueden ver los ojos. 

Ley del hombre

En febrero de 2001 Freeman visitó el centro de licencias de Winter Park en donde le tomaron una foto con el niqab puesto y le dieron su permiso para conducir.  Casi once meses más tarde, el estado de la Florida le informó a Freeman que le había revocado su licencia porque la foto no cumplía con los requisitos mínimos que exige la ley.

Freeman recibió una carta el 7 de enero de 2001 titulada &#8220;Orden de revocación, suspención y cancelación de licencia de conducir&#8221;.  El documento explicaba que su permiso quedaba cancelado inmediatamente por &#8220;no reportarse a la oficina de licencias de conducir para recibir un duplicado de su licencia sin velo&#8221;.

 &#8220;La ley FS 322.142(1) del estado de la Florida requiere una foto de cara completa&#8221;, declaró Robert Sánchez, portavoz del Departamento de Seguridad en las Autopistas y Vehículos de Motor.  Aseguró que no se trata de un caso de discriminación sino que simplemente se está corrigiendo el error que se cometió al expedir una licencia  que no cumple con los requisitos estatales.  &#8220;Somos parte de la rama ejecutiva y nuestra labor es hacer valer la ley&#8221;, aclaró.

Defensa religiosa

Freeman, de 35 años de edad, reclama que el estado atenta contra su libertad de culto.  Así que, en vez de sacar una licencia nueva, buscó asesoría legal con la Unión Americana de Libertades Civiles de la Florida (ACLU, por sus siglas en inglés) y radicó una demanda por discrimen religioso.  &#8220;Claramente se atentó contra la libertad religiosa de nuestra cliente. Y eso es lo que vamos a probar en corte&#8221;, manifestó Randall Marshall, representante de Freeman y director legal de ACLU.

Marshall alega que la licencia de conducir no es una identificación sino una prueba de que la persona que la posee cumple con los requisitos mínimos que exige la ley para manejar un vehículo de motor.  &#8220;Sánchez está mal.  La intención legislativa del permiso de conducir no indica que sea un medio para indentificar.  Además, para sacar la licencia ni siquiera se necesita mostrar una foto, solamente con el certificado de nacimiento la puedes obtener.&#8221;

La defensa de Freeman utiliza como base para su caso, tres decisiones jurídicas relacionadas a este tema.  &#8220;Hay tres casos previos donde la corte falló a favor de unos grupos de cristianos que, por sus creencias religiosas, se negaron a que le tomaran fotos para sus licencias de conducir.&#8221; 

Sánchez sostiene que el estado exige una fotografía de cara completa como requisito para obtener una licencia.  El estatuto 322.14 (1)(a) especifica que los solicitantes para permisos tipo A, B y C (conductores comerciales) tienen que personarse a la oficina de licencias para que les tomen una foto a color.  Sin embargo, la licencia de Freeman era clase E.  Este tipo de licencia es catalogada como no comercial y dentro de la ley 322 no se menciona que estos conductores requieran una foto. 

Libertad religiosa versus seguridad nacional

El caso de Freeman es el único que ha llegado a las cortes de la Florida. Según Sánchez, existe un desacuerdo entre los musulmanes sobre si el utilizar el velo es una tradición del Corán (libro que contiene las revelaciones de Dios y fundamentos del Islam) o es una costumbre del lugar donde viven.

Fawaz Al-Omeem, imam de la Asociación de estudiantes musulmanes de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida (FIU, por sus siglas en inglés), confirmó que el Islam exige que la mujeres utilicen un velo pero no especifica cuál.  &#8220;No es una obligación que utilicen el niqab pero el velo que cubre el cabello (hijab) sí es un requisito.  Nadie las obliga, ellas deciden cuando comenzar a usarlo.  Es una relación entre Dios y la mujer.&#8221;

Para Marshall este caso no debería establecer un precedente.  &#8220;No es que ahora todo el mundo se niegue a que le tomen una foto para la licencia.  Simplemente es cuestión de que el estado no viole las creencias religiosas de cierto grupo, como dispone la Ley de Restauración de 1998.&#8221;  Esta legislación asegura que &#8220;el gobierno no puede atentar substancialmente el ejercicio religioso de una persona&#8221;.

Sánchez dijo que el estado está dispuesto a llegar a acuerdos con las personas que no quieren descubrir su rostro en público.  &#8220;Le hemos ofrecido a algunas mujeres que vengan después de horas laborables y que una fémina sea la que le tome la foto para así respetar sus creencias religiosas.&#8221;

Por su parte, Marshall negó que ésa sea la solución para estos casos.  &#8220;Eso traería otros conflictos con la ley más adelante.  La única solución es que se le reestablesca la licencia otra vez (a Freeman).&#8221;  El abogado recalcó que las medidas de seguridad de los Estados Unidos no pueden poner en juego las libertades religiosas que garantiza la Constitución.  &#8220;Si la trajedia del 11 de septiembre no hubiese ocurrido, no estaríamos hablando de esto.&#8221;

Por medio de sus representantes legales Freeman dijo que está dispuesta a que le tomen huellas digitales y hasta que le hagan un examen de DNA para probar su identidad pero que, bajo ninguna condición, descubrirá su rostro para una foto.  Actualmente hay 11 estados que tienen excepciones en su leyes que le permiten a algunas personas que tengan su licencia de conducir sin necesidad de una foto.  Sultaana Freeman y sus abogados confían que en la Florida ocurra lo mismo.

Headline: De FIU a la Zona Cero:  el receso de primavera adopta nuevas formas
Subheadline: Claudia P. Davis
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Daytona Beach, Cancún, Panama City, Jamaica&#8230;¿la Zona Cero en Nueva York?   Increíble, pero definitivamente cierto.   Para un grupo de 15 jóvenes de FIU, encabezado por Alex Zarut, la Zona Cero se convirtió en el lugar predilecto este pasado receso de primavera o &#8220;Spring Break&#8221;.   Pero no se asusten.  La ciudad de Nueva York no ha convertido la Zona Cero en un área de entretenimiento con fines lucrativos.  No, el lugar sigue siendo aún el recordatorio del desastre más grande ocurrido en la historia de los Estados Unidos a manos de terroristas.  Entonces, ¿cómo se explica que un grupo de jóvenes estudiantes decida dejar atrás el sol y playa para visitar la devastación de la Zona Cero?

Alex Zarut explica, &#8220;Si pides a la gente que done su dinero ahora para la causa de septiembre 11, es probable que no te lo den.  Pero si les das la oportunidad de donar su tiempo para ayudar, enseguida lo quieren hacer&#8221;.  Las palabras de Alex se basan en hechos.  A dos días de haber anunciado al cuerpo estudiantil de FIU que la oportunidad de ayudar en la Zona Cero estaba disponible, el Centro de Acción Voluntaria recibió más de 60 solicitudes.    &#8220;No esperábamos tantas solicitudes.  Fue imposible llevar a todo el mundo&#8221;, dice Zarut.   De todos los estudiantes que solicitaron, sólo fueron 15 los escogidos.  Así emprendieron un viaje de &#8220;Spring Break&#8221; que los llevaría al corazón de la gran manzana; al lugar que ha despertado la sensibilidad de toda una nación y el mundo entero.

Las impresiones no se hicieron esperar.  Llegaron de noche, a la ciudad de Nueva Jersey, y lo primero que divisaron a lo lejos fueron dos rayos de luz opaca que parecían tocar el cielo.  Estas dos luces, paralela una con la otra, han sido de los primeros monumentos establecidos para conmemorar la gran pérdida de septiembre 11.  Para Alex, una vez en el area del desastre, la impresión fue de asombro.  &#8220;Parecía como si hubiera caído una bomba&#8230;los edificios todos rotos y una tremenda cantidad de escombros&#8221;.  La determinación y espíritu de los trabajadores fueron otras de las cosas que afectaron positivamente a este joven universitario.  &#8220;Los trabajadores de rescate no perdían nada de tiempo.  Comían su comida rápido y regresaban otra vez al sitio de trabajo&#8230;aún tienen tanto por hacer pues todavía queda mucha gente perdida que no han identificado&#8221;, dice Zarut con cierta melancolía.

Haber servido de apoyo a estos trabajadores incansables inspiró a todos los estudiantes que participaron en esta causa.  El Centro de Acción Voluntaria de FIU, en colaboración con el Salvation Army de Nueva York, hicieron posible hacer pioneros de estudiantes.  Estos valientes han sido el primer grupo universitario en participar como voluntarios en la Zona Cero.  Para Alex Zarut todo se resume en una analogía &#8220;Al igual que una persona gasta miles dólares en vacaciones para escalar el Everest y pasa hambre, frío y cansancio, así nosotros trabajamos durante nuestras vacaciones.  Sí, llegamos cansados.  Pero si nos dan la oportunidad de hacerlo de nuevo, lo volveríamos hacer&#8221;.  

La verdad es que los chicos no tuvieron que escalar tan imponente montaña, pero se enfrentaron a la difícil tarea en la que se ve envuelto el mundo de hoy: desafiar al mal contribuyendo con lo mejor de la calidad humana.

Headline: La difícil detección del plagio académico
Subheadline: Paola Guerrero
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
&#8220;John&#8221; llega casi todos los días después de las nueve de la noche a la biblioteca pública de FIU simulando ser otro estudiante más. Una vez se sienta, su actitud es no percatarse de lo que rodea y concentrarse en lo suyo. 

El es un estudiante de 27 años de origen británico, políglota y con tres grados, uno de ellos y el más reciente, en &#8220;Negocios Internacionales&#8221; que culminó en diciembre en Barry University.. Hace más de tres años que él y su hermano mayor se dedican a realizar asignaciones académicas para estudiantes de pregrado de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida (FIU) y de Barry University. Su experiencia es enfocada en trabajos con temas de negocios, economía y de vez en cuando, ensayos de diferentes temas que no le exijan mayor &#8220;desgaste mental&#8221;.

&#8220;Según lo que tenga que hacer, y el tiempo que tenga cobro por página, a veces cobro $30 por cada una, porque el investigar me toma tiempo y lo que hago es de calidad&#8221;, También se ha presentado en un salón el día del examen y ha firmado por el estudiante y ha realizado trabajos de grado.

Servicios de tutorías

Otro tipo de servicio también muy conocido a través de volantes, son los tutores o personas que ofrecen servicios de asesoría a diferentes asignaciones. Sin embargo las tutorías tambien se confunden con el servicio de elaborar asignaciones al estudiante. &#8220;Carlos&#8221; presta este tipo de servicio en FIU y con una página Web diseñada por él mismo en temas concernientes a Física, matemáticas y estadística. &#8220;La gente es libre de hacer lo que quiera. Mis servicios no los ofrezco directamente como una persona que vende sus conocimientos, pero muchas veces el estudiante no tiene tiempo, o realmente no se siente apto para realizar el trabajo y sin necesidad de ofrecerme ellos mismos me solicitan que les haga todo, obviamente pagándome más por mi trabajo&#8221;.

Tomando el caso de FIU, esta institución no tiene un programa instalado para detectar este tipo de fraude, pero orienta al profesor de manera preventiva. En caso de una sospecha de fraude, se debe recoger la mayor información posible antes de tomar acciones en el asunto, incluyendo:

- Entrevistar al estudiante e intentar puntualizar &#8220;el hecho&#8221; y posteriormente consultar el caso con el Chair o Supervisor, y llevarlo a consulta al Departamento de Academic Affairs.

- Una vez teniendo la prueba se intenta puntualizar los cargos con este departamento y resolver el caso informal o formalmente.

Generalmente existen tres tipos de sanción. Dependiendo de la gravedad del caso, o del tipo de fraude, la asignación obtiene la calificación más baja (F). Como segunda estancia la pérdida de la materia y como tercera, la suspensión y por último la expulsión. Esto dependiendo del tipo de exigencia en el reglamento de la institución. El año pasado FIU registró 11 casos de pregrado en los cuales los estudiantes fueron suspendidos. 

Detección del estudiante

Dr. Ken Johnson Ph.D Asistente de Vicepresidencia de Asuntos Académicos (Academic Affairs) de FIU  comenta que la mayoría de los casos reportados al nivel de pregrado en esta universidad se presentan por la Internet o porque estudiantes de semestres pasados, les venden las asignaciones a estudiantes nuevos, los cuáles son fácilmente detectados por los docentes. &#8220;Lo que más les repetimos a los profesores es que un buen estudiante se conoce desde el principio, por lo tanto si de la noche a la mañana, el alumno empieza a elaborar grandiosos trabajos eso es sospechable, ya que el cambio se presenta radicalmente&#8221;. 

Existen dos tipos de plagio categorizados por el Departamento de Academic  Affairs de FIU:

1. El de primer grado que es el plagio intencional, donde al estudiante se le comprueba que elaboró el fraude a conciencia o premeditadamente.

2. El de segundo grado, que logra comprobar que el fraude no fue elaborado premeditadamente y que por desconocimiento a las reglas no se reconocieron las fuentes.

El reglamento 

En el caso de FIU, el reglamento de estudiante define que: &#8220;El plagio académico consiste en el uso deliberado y apropiación de trabajos de otras personas sin ninguna identificación de la fuente, o que haga aparecer su información como propia. Cualquier estudiante que se apropie del crédito, ideas o materiales ajenos se consideraran culpable de plagio&#8221;.

De 1996 al 2000, FIU detectó 120 casos de plagio académico incluyendo trampa en los exámenes y falsificaciones de excusas médicas. Aunque  Johnson considera que lo detectado es poco, esta convencido que la cifra es muchísimo mayor. &#8220;Lo que sucede es que cada año existen más formas y tipología de plagios&#8221;.

Muchos estudiantes al cometer este delito, quedan &#8220;en archivo&#8221; en sus universidades. Posteriormente cuando el estudiante solicita el empleo, las empresas piden recomendaciones y al darse cuenta de este tipo de penalidad, la respuesta es negativa a la hora de una recomendación, incluso de la contratación misma.

Headline: Arrancó el Proyecto Chihuahua
Subheadline: Robert Valencia
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Después de casi dos años de negociaciones y preparativos, el Proyecto Chihuahua se puso en marcha para ofrecer a los estudiantes de periodismo de México,  la primera Maestría de su género en América Latina.  Dicho proyecto está organizado por la Universidad Internacional de la Florida con los auspicios del Instituto Tecnológico y Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), en sus campos de Chihuahua y Ciudad Juárez.

Mercedes Vigón, quien es la coordinadora del Proyecto Chihuahua de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida, aseguró que es una iniciativa muy bonita en el cual se ha puesto mucho esfuerzo. 

&#8220;El campus de Chihuahua fue el primero en acercarse a nosotros para iniciar este proyecto, aunque el de Ciudad Juárez también se interesó, a pesar de que la distancia entre estas dos ciudades es grande.&#8221; 

Uno de los propósitos de esta iniciativa es reforzar el nivel académico de los estudiantes para lograr un periodismo más profesional y que, al mismo tiempo, logre captar al público. Otra de las metas impuestas es exportar este proyecto a otros medios de comunicación, y también el de llegar a diversos organismos de la sociedad chihuahuense.  

A pesar de la crisis económica, ocasionada por los hechos del 11 de septiembre que amenazó gravemente la idea, y de la galopante tasa de desempleo en Ciudad Juárez, los organizadores del &#8220;Proyecto Chihuahua&#8221;decidieron absorber con recursos propios parte del costo de esta Maestría.  De acuerdo con los creadores del proyecto, México atraviesa por una severa crisis de credibilidad en sus instituciones, y es la prensa quien debe asumir buena parte de la responsabilidad para descifrar y explicar el presente del país Azteca.

Durante una ceremonia realizada en el campus del ITESM de Chihuahua, el director de la Escuela de Periodismo de la Universidad Internacional de la Florida, doctor Arthur Heise, expresó sus felicitaciones por la visión que se está demostrando, a pesar de la dura crisis por la que atraviesa el mundo actualmente.  De acuerdo con Heise, los estudiantes son afortunados por beneficiarse con una lección tan visionaria, algo que no es frecuente en los Estados Unidos ni en Latinoamérica.

Asimismo, el doctor Heise destacó los logros de la Escuela de Periodismo de FIU, como los ocho premios Pulitzer, máximo galardón del periodismo, conseguidos en tan poco tiempo. Igualmente citó el reconocimiento que recientemente se le hizo a Mario Diament, Profesor de la Maestría, quien fue nombrado Periodista Ilustre de la Academia Argentina, un privilegio vitalicio que sólo han conseguido cuarenta personas.

Para realzar los alcances de FIU en Latinoamérica y el Caribe, también se resaltaron los logros obtenidos por Charles Green, periodista quien durante 15 años perteneció al buró de la Agencia Associated Press (AP) de México, Centroamérica y parte de Latinoamérica.  

Por su parte, el director del ITESM de Chihuahua, Víctor Gutiérrez Aladro, alabó el dinamismo y el liderazgo de Osvaldo Rodríguez Borunda, el principal impulsor de este proyecto, quien logró que más de 30 periodistas se inscribieran en Chihuahua y en Ciudad Juárez. 

Uno de los puntos en el cual Rodríguez Borunda hizo hincapié es que la sociedad civil ha demostrado estar muchas veces por encima de las instituciones públicas y sociales, incluyendo la prensa; y partiendo de esa base, el Proyecto Chihuahua servirá para hacer parte de la tarea. Para estar a la altura de grandes exigencias nacionales.
