Headline: Universities struggle with minority ruling
Author: Jodi S. Cohen / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
Jessica Perlo arrived at Northwestern University early, one of 32 freshmen eager to get a jump-start on college by participating in writing workshops, campus tours and meetings with student organizations.

Launched during the Civil Rights movement, the orientation program was long reserved for minority students - not for whites such as Perlo, 18, who said she was lucky to get a chance to attend.

"Any other year, I wouldn't be here," said Perlo, one of the first non-minority students to participate in the 38-year-old Summer Academic Workshop. "You get to know the campus early so when school starts, I'm not lost."

Throughout the country, schools such as Northwestern are opening up minority scholarships, fellowships, academic support programs and summer enrichment classes to students of any race.

The change follows last year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that race can be considered in college admissions but only among other factors and that candidates must be evaluated individually. That landmark 5-4 decision preserved affirmative action in admissions, but found unconstitutional a University of Michigan program that automatically gave extra points to African-American, Latino and American Indian applicants.

In what some now say is an unexpected erosion of affirmative action, colleges are interpreting the ruling to mean they can no longer offer race-exclusive programs designed specifically to help minorities.

Critics argue that they remain constitutional because the court decision only addressed admissions. But some college officials, worried about potential lawsuits, are taking a different stance.

At Yale University in Conn., an orientation program for minority freshmen, along with two research fellowships, has been opened to all students.

And at the University of Illinois, a program for minority engineering students that provided internships, scholarships and tutoring was renamed and broadened to include non-minority students.

"Everybody has seen pretty clearly that the court is frowning on programs that are 100 percent race based," said Stephen Fischer, Northwestern's associate provost for undergraduate education. Of the students who participated in the university's early orientation program this year, five were white or Asian.

There is concern that including other groups will make it harder to create an early comfort zone for minority students, an original goal of the program.

Elise Boddie, education director for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, disagrees that the court ruling requires universities to abandon minority-only programs. She worries that schools have begun to relinquish their support of affirmative action programs despite a shortage of minority students at many of the nation's campuses.

"These programs have been critical to opening up doors of opportunity for students of color," Boddie said.

All of this is being hailed as good news by affirmative action critics such as the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia. Early last year, the conservative advocacy group began sending letters to about 100 colleges, threatening to file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights if their race-exclusive programs weren't changed.

"The point the court emphasized was individualized consideration," said Roger Clegg, the center's vice president and general counsel. "A program where a student is not allowed to participate for no other reason than skin color is not providing individualized consideration."

Even when programs are open to students of all races and ethnicities, the types of students who choose to participate may not change. At Yale University, a weeklong orientation program that focused on racial and ethnic identity included non-minority students for the first time this summer, but only one of the 97 participants was white.

Many school administrators are looking to see what happens at the University of Michigan, which defended its undergraduate and law school affirmative action admissions policies before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Some Michigan programs will continue, including speaking engagements and other outreach efforts at Detroit high schools aimed at African-American and Latino students. But officials continue to review and change the university's scholarships, recruiting efforts and academic support programs, said University of Michigan attorney Jonathan Alger.

Colleges appear most reluctant to reduce minority-targeted scholarships and financial aid that could make a difference in whether a student picks a school.

"What schools have done is expand the criteria so many of the same people are now included but it is not race-exclusive. Many of these achieve the same ends," said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an organization representing 1,800 college and university administrators.

Many campuses intend to defend their programs, at least for now.

Swarthmore, Haverford and Bryn Mawr Colleges in Pennsylvania continued their jointly run minority freshman program this summer for about 75 students who arrived on campus a few days early for leadership training and to learn about academic and extracurricular programs. The goal is to "prepare them for some of the challenges of being non-white in the white-majority context," said Swarthmore spokesman Tom Krattenmaker.

"That is among the programs we are reviewing to make sure they're not in violation," said Maurice Eldridge, Swarthmore's vice president of college and community relations. "I don't think one has to automatically assume that because there's tension in this area, one is automatically doing something wrong."

At Northwestern, about 120 of the 1,000 freshmen in the Arts and Sciences school were invited to this year's orientation program. Instead of sending invitations to every African-American, Latino and American Indian student as in years past, officials invited students who they thought could use extra help in writing.

"I'm glad it's open to everyone," said Lindsey White, a biracial student from Minnesota, "What we can learn is beneficial to everyone."

Headline: Socialist candidate lectures at BBC
Author: Pooja Sarma / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate Roger Calero spoke  to a mixed crowd of students, faculty and administrators at the Biscayne Bay Campus on Oct. 12 

Calero  began his lecture by stating that many people still think socialism is the best alternative to the American two-party system, which his party maintains promotes capitalism to the neglect of the working class. 

Throughout the presentation, Calero emphasized his belief that the SWP stands and fights for the rights of the working class. Its aim, he said, is to support worker's rights, to organize unions and to defend the laborers against the assaults of corporate bosses.

"The democratic governments are not interested in solving unemployment problems," he said. "[This problem] keeps up the competition."

Sonya Swanson, a freshman and education major, agreed with Calero's message, stating her dislike for current politics.

"Power is in the hands of a few, and others are being exploited," she said.

Calero also stated the party's goal to remain a vehicle of new ideas to those tired of the current system. 

"When people are finally tired of the unfairness of a capitalist society, they will have an option right in front of them," Calero said.

Born in Nicaragua, Calero moved to the U.S. in 1985 and has been a part of the Socialist movement since 1993.

In 1994, he helped mobilize support in Los Angeles against Proposition 187, a California measure intended to deny undocumented workers  and their children access to public education, health care and other social services.

Headline: Group hunts terrorists in chats
Author: BRIAN KLADKO / The Record
&nbsp;
Internet chat rooms aren't just great places for anonymous flirting. They're also a great place for terrorists to conspire.

At least that's what researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are thinking. And they persuaded the federal government to give them $550,000 to figure it out. 

On the face of it, a chat room seems like too warm  a place to hatch a plot.

But the professors at RPI, in Troy, N.Y., don't see it that way. They think chat rooms are well suited for terrorists because the forums can be easily accessed from almost anywhere in the world, users can adopt any number of identities and, most important, a group of people can camouflage their conversations amid all the other chatter.

"The security lies in its overtness," said Peter Chalk, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp., a think tank. "You're hiding in plain sight."

To communicate "under the radar," terrorists have been known to discard their mobile phones every week or so, or change their e-mail accounts just as frequently and log on only at Internet cafes.

When RPI professor Al Wallace began his research six or seven years ago, he didn't start out with the intention of ferreting out terrorists on the Internet. A 68-year-old professor of "decision sciences and engineering systems," he focused on how people come to trust each other on the Internet.

After Sept. 11, 2001, when finding terrorists suddenly became a priority, Wallace and his collaborators took that idea in another direction: If you can discern who trusts whom online, you also can discern who is conspiring with whom.

Wallace's group applied for funding from the National Science Foundation's "Approaches to Combat Terrorism" - an effort begun after Sept. 11 to tap the brains of the country's academics to assist in the war against al-Qaida.

NSF officials and the intelligence community, which includes the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, decide which projects to fund.

The research doesn't rely on what people say to each online. All that matters is who is messaging whom, and how often.

By ignoring the text of messages, a computer could process much more data. And it won't be thrown off by attempts at linguistic subterfuge.

And, in Wallace's view, this type of surveillance wouldn't violate anyone's privacy, because it's not monitoring what they say. He considers it less intrusive than the "cookies" that Web sites use to identify repeat visitors.

"I'm not going to be able to tell that it's a terrorist group," Wallace says. "All we're going to say is, `Here is a group of people that's been talking a lot, you ought to check them out.'"

That explanation doesn't reassure Mark Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. Although people aren't being targeted for using words such as "Quran" or "civil aviation," he says the research is based on another shaky premise: that people trying to disguise their communications are up to no good.

"I don't believe that secrecy is inherently suspect,"  Rotenberg said.

Headline: Court weighs whether juveniles can be executed
Author: Stephen Henderson / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
The Supreme Court's two centrist justices emerged during arguments on Oct. 13 as the key votes in a case that will decide the future of the death penalty for juvenile offenders in America.

While the court's more liberal justices and conservative stalwarts seemed firmly on one side or another, justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, who generally provide the court's swing votes, appeared torn over the moral and practical implications of the court's decision.

O'Connor, through her relative silence during oral arguments in Roper v. Simmons, left little clue as to how she'll vote. In his active questioning, however, Kennedy made it clear that he worried about the nation's near international isolation on the issue, but he also said he has deep misgivings about exempting all teens from ultimate justice.

At one point Kennedy suggested that sparing 16- and 17-year-olds from execution could result in their recruitment by 18-year-olds for murderous duties.

"Wouldn't that create a lot of 16- and 17-year-old hit men?" Kennedy asked.

The case offers the justices their greatest chance to make a strong social statement this term and follows several other cases in which the court has pared back the death penalty.

The justices have outlawed executions of the mentally retarded, cracked down on appeals courts that hadn't taken capital inmates' appeals seriously and stiffened requirements for defense attorneys.

The court last considered juvenile executions in 1989, when it narrowly outlawed the execution of offenders under 16 but preserved it for 16- and 17-year-olds.

Nineteen states permit executions for older teenagers, though very few still seek or impose death against teens and the trend is to move away from all capital punishment for juveniles.

The court's 2002 decision to outlaw executions of the mentally retarded gave immediate rise to Roper v. Simmons, in which the Missouri Supreme Court said the same logic would apply to teens. Their brains aren't fully developed, and so their reasoning, judgment and capacity to understand consequences are limited, the court said.

Even though Christopher Simmons kidnapped and bound a woman before tossing her from a railroad trestle into a river, the Missouri court said his juvenile status made it cruel and unusual to put him to death.

Prior to Wednesday's arguments, it seemed the case could be headed for an easy time at the high court, given that four of the more liberal justices (David Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer) had already stated their opposition to juvenile executions. Only Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist have generally resisted the court's trend toward more moderate death penalty policy.

In addition, the court was inundated with scientific studies in the Simmons case about the differences between adult and adolescent brains. Briefs from 48 other nations and more than a dozen Nobel Peace Prize winners also rolled in to sway the justices' decision.

But arguments revealed a court whose important center hasn't yet reached a decision, leaving open the possibility that juveniles won't be stricken from the ranks of the death-eligible in America's courts.

Seth Waxman, the attorney for Simmons, played up the scientific evidence, the growing national consensus and the nation's increasing international isolation on this issue.

"What's remarkable here is how robust the consensus is on this issue," Waxman said. "The constitutional calculus here favors outlawing the practice."

Scalia took issue with Waxman's logic.

"If the consensus is so clear, why can't legislatures handle it?" he asked. Scalia, Rehnquist and Kennedy indicated they'd like to see the studies about adolescent development tested in adversarial trials in lower courts before they accepted their conclusions as truth.

James Layton, Missouri's state solicitor, agreed with the conservative jurists and said this is a decision for legislatures to make, not courts.

Layton also pointed out what he called a fundamental difference between juvenile status and mental retardation. The court's 2002 ruling about retardation is about mental ability itself as a component of culpability, he said. Age is a mere proxy for mental ability, and so outlawing all juvenile executions would prevent states from giving it to teens who could be proved mature.

"Legislatures and juries are capable of evaluating these things and deciding for themselves," Layton said.

Ginsburg pounced on Layton's position.

"Eighteen is the dividing line for buying tobacco, for voting, sitting on juries or joining the military," she said. "Does it make sense for younger children to be death eligible but not eligible to be full members of the community? They're wards of their parents."

Layton said states have generally been free to set boundaries with regard to age-of-majority questions and pointed to differences in state policies on juvenile driving and marrying practices.

Kennedy asked whether the nation's "unusual" position internationally should have any bearing on the case.

Layton said no, not any more than if the nation were the only country that didn't execute juveniles and was being pressured by others to change.

O'Connor, who's normally an active interrogator, asked a single question about the national consensus about the juvenile death penalty. The numbers on that issue, she noted, were about the same as the numbers for mental retardation at the time the court outlawed those executions. "What's the difference?" she asked Layton.

The court's decision could come as early as December or as late as July.

Headline: Gay marriage viewed as defamed custom under hypocritical society
Author: Cesar Gutierrez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
A few days ago, I read in The Miami Herald that Spain has added its name to the growing list of countries that allow same sex couples to legally commit to each other until death do them apart. As we all know, this contract gives them full constitutional rights. The article also commented on the Vatican's reaction, which condemned Spain's decision.

That got me thinking, again, on the controversy that same topic has brought up in the United States. 

Some folks are deeply offended by just the thought of two persons of the same sex legally committing to each other. They argue that marriage was created exclusively for heterosexual couples. But they don't give any reasons for feeling this way.

Rather, their arguments are vague and based on personal opinions instead of facts. They share President Bush's simplistic view that no matter what, marriage is just for a man and a woman. He also says that same sex marriage is disrespectful to the institution itself and that it goes against society's moral values.

Along that same line, Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland stated that God created "Adam and Eve," and not "Adam and Steve." Uh, that's what I call philosophical thinking. And of course the Pope, rest assured, as if he had spoken to God, says that gays and lesbians are evil to begin with and that the creator has forbidden them to marry.

Fine. Even though these arguments are similar to those of a six-year-old child, I would give  these people credit if the reality of marriage were different from what we see today. Husbands kill their wives. Wives kill their entire families. Both husbands and wives cheat on each other, and the divorce rate is getting higher and higher. Now when they mention respect for the institution, well, I just have to laugh. I guess for them it is acceptable to go to Las Vegas and, after a night of tequila shots, martinis and drugs, get married in one of the famous drive through chapels, only to  wake up the next morning and say "Sorry, we were just having fun."

Have they condemned publicly celebrities such as Marc Anthony, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez or Angelina Jolie, among others, for not respecting marriage? 

My guess is that as long as we are heterosexuals, God agrees with us when we cheat on our spouses, marry as many times as we want to and have kids without giving them the emotional stability they need to grow up mentally healthy. Or what about everyday men and women who make a "lifetime commitment" in front of a judge so that one of them can receive 10 grand and the other one can become a resident of this country? Is that respect for the institution?     

However, when it comes to two people loving each other, these folks will have a problem, regardless of their gender, because they are willing to build a family and grow old together.

Shouldn't this government, which spends millions of dollars fighting for "democracy" here and in other countries, give  every one the chance to fulfill their dreams? Shouldn't we all let God be the one to judge and punish if there is something to be punished? This is just something to think about.

Headline: Football fans battle at Madden Challenge
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For those who were looking for solace from the miserable Miami Dolphins season, Bayside Market Place was the place to be on Oct. 9. 

700 people from all around South Florida went to forget about their home team's woes at the 2004 EA Sports Madden Challenge. 

512 people was the maximum number of contestants but there were still others on hand to lend friends their support and create a crowd type atmosphere, as if it were a real football game.

The Madden Challenge is a 32 city tour where one winner from each city has a chance to play for $50,000 in the finals. 

The winner from each city will be flown to Las Vegas where the final tournament will take place. For each city's winner, the trip to Vegas is all expenses paid with hotel accommodations at the fabulous Luxor Resort Hotel and Casino. 

The tour began on Aug. 14 in Minneapolis,  and will culminate on the weekend of Dec. 10-13 in Las Vegas.

 The Madden Challenge isn't just for the hard core gamers either, some NFL players join in on the fun.

 Players such as Dante Culpepper, Jerry Porter, Ahman Green, and Roy Williams join in on the fun, even though they barely make it past the first round. 

Walk-in registration began at 8:00 a.m. and to the dismay of many, the event was fully booked a little over two hours later.

 Competition was fierce from the beginning with people shouting at each other showing who the ultimate football player was.  

All the games were played on the PlayStation 2, which displeased many of the participants who primarily use the X-Box.

 "They need to hold this [expletive] with the X-Box," said one gentleman who referred to himself as Kill. "The X-Box is much better [for Madden 2005], the game speed is better, the controller, everything." He sites this as his reason for coming in last place statistically speaking.

Number of copies sold on PlayStation 2 was the deciding factor in which game system was going to    		  be used.

"The reason why the event is held with the PS2 is mainly because Madden sells a lot more copies on it than that of any other system," explains Charles Smith a.k.a. "The Solution" who was a finalist in the first ever Madden Challenge and is now one of the head promoters for the event. 

"We have seen the sale of Madden for the X-Box increase and for next year's tournament we might try to incorporate [The Xbox] in someway."

Many people used the event as an escape from ordinary life and a reason to play a football game console.

"If you love football, you love Madden. Coming here to play gives you a chance to have fun and represent your city," said Andre Oran a.k.a. 305 who uses the name 305 to represent the Miami area code.

With the Dolphins struggling, people were not using the Dolphins as much as in previous years. Popular teams included the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots, teams that are currently undefeated in the NFL.

"After Ricky [Williams] retired, I no longer use the Dolphins. I like the Eagles because they now have Terrell Owens," said Jesse Cuadra who used the Eagles in the competition but still managed to lose in the second round.

After all was said and done the contenders distanced themselves from the pretenders. In the end, however, one man stood on top on the mountain. Thomas "UCF Champ" Tsanadis from Wellington won his trip to Las Vegas despite being down 21-7 late in the game.

Tsanadis will now represent South Florida in defining the king of Madden football in the United States.

Headline: Track men struggle, women succeed
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In the final meaningful race of the year before the Sun Belt Conference tournament, the Golden Panther Women's Cross Country team fared well but the men's team struggled.

On Oct. 8, both the men and women's teams traveled to Kissimmee, Florida for the annual Walt Disney Cross Country Classic. 

For the men's team, it was somewhat of a struggle finishing mid-pack; the women on the other hand finished fifth overall in the competition.

Having struggled at last year's meet, finishing 13th as a team, both coaches and runners knew their strategy had to change. 

"[We had to] get out fast and run hard early, and that is exactly what happened," said Coach Steven Rubin.

From the opening gun shot, lead runner Amanda Howard ran at the front of the pack with the eventual race victors. 

She finished the race in 14th place with a personal record time of 18:30 in the 5K race [an average of 6:10 a mile]; over 1:25 faster than the time she posted at the same course in 2003. 

After the race, Rubin was proud of his star.

 "Amanda is doing what Amanda has to do...she is our shining star."

Howard was not the only Golden Panther to shine. Five of Howard's teammates also posted personal record times, en route to a top five team overall finish for the women. 

Freshmen Paola Reategui broke her previous record by almost 30 seconds, finishing with a  personal record 19:09.

 Her teammate Apryl Wall finished 11 seconds behind Reategui, beating her personal record by almost an entire minute. 

Deidra Witherspoon and Katherine Cardenas also both broke the 20 minute mark finishing with times of 19:29 and 19:33 respectively on the fast five kilometer course. 

Howard, Reategui, and Cardenas all set personal records for the second straight race. 

The men on the other hand struggled for the second race in a row, finishing 18th as a team. 

Coach Rubin described the men's performance as a stepping stone, acknowledging that the young team is just not there developementally yet. 

He also stressed that improvement is needed across the board by each member of the 8k team. 

Freshmen DJ Keller led the Golden Panther men, finishing 77th overall with an 8k time of 27:30 [an average of 5:30 a mile]. 

Junior Noel Delgadillo finished just two seconds behind his running partner. 

Freshmen Rene Rodriguez, Robert Castillo and Angel Fernandez rounded out the top five for the Golden Panther.

The University of Florida, University of Tampa, Florida Atlantic and Florida Southern defeated the women's team.  

Looking ahead to the Sun Belt Conference Championship meet on Oct. 30 in Little Rock, AK, one thing is clear for the women's cross country team: 

 "[We] have to run the race as hard as we can. We have to run smart and strong," said Rubin.

Only practice and final preparations are left now for the only meet that matters most this season.

Headline: 'Tiger' turns around Golden Panther defense
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
He is a player's coach. The term gets tossed about and hung around the neck of too many likeable coaches, but it fits Bernard Clark like a helmet. 

The former University of Miami and Cincinnati Bengals linebacker is now the Defensive Coordinator for the FIU football team. In case you haven't noticed, the defense is a whole lot better. 

Before this season the defensive unit was a liability, especially in the later moments of close games. 

In 2003, opposing offenses averaged just over 400 yards per game. FIU gave up 2,731 yards on the ground and the inability to stop teams from running had a lot to do with its 10 losses last season. 

Clark has imposed the "attack the ball mentality" on the team this season. When hired earlier this year, Clark saw a defensive team that was fast enough but not aggressive enough in getting to the ball.

"We yell 'swarm' when we break the huddle," said Coach Clark. "The main difference when you look at last year's film is we're getting players to the ball. Last year there would be one or two players on the tackle, now we got five or six," said Clark.

At Youngstown State, in the first game of the 2004 schedule, the Golden Panthers showed everyone this year would be different. 

FIU did what was previously unthinkable: they stopped a good running team on the road while playing from behind in the forth quarter. They did this by shutting down the Penguins offense in the second half, facilitating David Tabor's three touchdown comeback. 

The personnel on the field hasn't changed much in a year. The players are a little older and maybe wiser, but the primary difference is the attitude of the defense. 

"I give a lot of props to coach Clark," said captain and linebacker Lance Preston. "[He came] in here and changed things around. Even the way we practice is different and it showed during the game." 

'Tiger' Clark has given this team an identity. The players perform for him because they believe in his leadership. They buy into his defensive schemes and most have nothing but praise for him.

Added defensive tackles leader and safety John Haritan: "We're a different team, we've grown up a bunch. This year we have gotten bigger and faster and we have Coach Clark that makes a big difference."

FIU had not won a road game in its first two years of collegiate football until the win against Youngstown State. 

This season, the Golden Panthers have won both of their away games, due in large part to good defensive play. A good measuring stick is the performance at Stephen F. Austin. 

The Lumberjacks mobile quarterback rushed for 121 yards on 13 carries last year against FIU at FIU stadium.

 Halfback Derek Farmer, who transferred from Texas A&M after leading the Aggies in rushing two consecutive years to SFA this season, was also stopped.

 The pair was held to a combined 78 yards on 25 carries last week as the Golden Panthers dominated the Jacks through most of the game.  

Clark jokes around with his players by comparing football Saturdays to regular ones.

 "On a Saturday night, on the field, you can lay a half-back flat and all the referee is going to tell you is to get back in the huddle. You do that same thing on any other Saturday night, outside the field and you're going to go to jail."

The coach knows that his defense still has room for improvement. 

The Louisiana-Lafayette game could have been won if not for missed opportunities to grab turnovers and untimely penalties. 

"I'm happy with where we're at, but I'm not satisfied," Clark added. "My goal [on the field] is to be the best defense in the Sun-Belt. My goal off the field is to turn these guys into better sons, better fathers, and better men." 

With this aggressive defense to compliment Strock's high-flying offense, the Golden Panthers are looking for its first ever-winning season. 

The teams next home game will be against McNeese State on Oct. 23 at FIU Stadium.

Subheadline: Crowe returns with championship goals
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After sitting out the 2003 season due to ineligibility, goalkeeper Shawn Crowe waited anxiously for this season to kick off.

Last season, the team advanced to the NCAA championship under star goalie Roy Rosenberg.  Crowe sat out the season due to academic issues and used his time away from the field to improve his skills. 

Now as the starter, Crowe's academic issues have been resolved and he is looking forward to his opportunity in leading the team, the same way Rosenberg did. 

Crowe came into FIU as the back up goalie for the 2002 soccer squad. Crowe sat out the 2003 season but red shirted, giving him an extra year of eligibility and allowing him to be a sophomore this year.

  Knowing he still had a lot to learn and ground to make up, he stayed focused and rode the wave until finally, his turn would come.

"I wasn't really intimidated when I first came up I knew I had to work hard and accept my role," Crowe said.

As a backup goalie, Crowe had a lot of mentors to guide him in the right direction. Despite the competition during Crowe's freshman year, the biggest mentor Crowe had was FIU goalie record holder Rosenberg.

"The relationship between Roy and I was good.  There was never any controversy.  He made me into a better goalie by teaching me a lot of the mental aspects of the game; he always told me the game was 99% mental, and 1% physical," Crowe added.

Experience and knowledge from Rosenburg mixed with great mental preparations from assistant coach Reginald Pierre-Jerome (a former professional goalie), allowed Crowe to develop a formula that would allow him to succeed at the collegiate level...and that he did.  

In 2002, Crowe's freshman year, he played in six matches, four of which he started.  By posting a 1.25 goals-against average and a .762 save percentage in 360 minutes, Crowe helped lead his team into the crucial NCAA tournament.

Greatness is usually measured by how a player can respond to critical situations when their teams need them the most.  The average athlete will let the game moments and crowd disturb him; the good player will set it aside but the great player will rely on his inner resourcefulness. 

As the soccer team season is coming to midpoint, Crowe has shown that he can be a strong team leader.

Crowe was named Atlantic Soccer Conference Goalie of the Week for his four save performance in a 2-1 victory over Oneonta State.

Crowe was successful early in his freshman year. By shutting out Mercer and the University of Central Florida, Crowe was named ASC Rookie of the Wee.

"I would have to say that [shutting out UCF and Mercer] was my defining moment.  I feel as if I played great those days and somehow, I was being controlled by a higher power."

Crowe was born in Aurora, Colorado.  It here that he established a good character and love for the game of soccer.

"My parents always told me: never give up; keep trying and always have a positive attitude; if you work hard enough, you can accomplish anything you want," Crowe said.

In high school, Crowe was a master of his craft.  After being honored as team MVP, winning two league titles, and being crowned state champion his senior year, Crowe went on to being ranked an all-state goalkeeper and first-team all-conference.

When it came down to picking the right college, the rising star had many options, but the blue and gold of FIU was the color present in his eyes.

"I chose FIU because I wanted to take my game to the next level and I knew this program will prepare me to play overseas," Crowe said.

Crowe has aspirations of playing in Liverpool as part of the English Premiere League and will get his shot this January as he makes the trip oversees to enhance his soccer skills.  Crowe's ultimate goal is to win an NCAA National Championship.

"That [a National Championship] is the one thing I want to accomplish in soccer.  I feel as if this team is the best I've seen.  We are more experienced and get together better on defense.  They're a great group of guys."

Currently the soccer team is 4-4 and in second place in the Atlantic Soccer Conference.

Headline: Dave Barry lecture to raise fund
Author: Jackie Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
He's won the Pulitzer Prize, written twenty-five books, inspired a TV show and plays lead guitar in the "literary rock band," the Rock Bottom Remainders.

Taking time from his busy schedule, Miami Herald humorist, Dave Barry, will be the guest of honor at a dinner in FIU's Wertheim Performing Arts Center on Oct. 21 at 7:30 p.m. The purpose of his appearance is to raise funds for the College of Engineering's Leonard Kaufman Scholarship fund.

The $500 annual scholarship, founded two years ago in his honor by the family of Michelle Kaufman, a Miami Herald sports writer and Barry's wife, recognizes academic excellence in the field of industrial engineering.

Leonard Kaufman was an adjunct professor in the Industrial and Systems Engineering department who passed away from a heart attack in 2001.

Students of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering Professional and Honor Societies and faculty advisor Ronald Giachett are helping to coordinate the evening.

According to Avy Weberman, director of development for the College of Engineering, the fundraiser will consist of three events: a cocktail reception for special sponsors, the dinner itself and an hour-long presentation by Barry followed by a question and answer session. The dinner will consist of barbequed meatballs, baked brie croute, hot crab dip and fresh fruit, along with wine, sodas  and ice tea.

Besides Barry, other speakers will include Dr. Vish Prasad, dean of the College of Engineering and Michelle Kaufman who will speak about her father and his legacy.

Barry, a New York native, has had his articles published worldwide and in over 500 newspapers in the United States.

Over the course of his career, he has published countless books, including "Babies and Hazards of Sex" and "Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States." Some books have even been turned to movies.

He also had a CBS television series, "Dave's World," based on two of his books.

Though Barry currently lives in Miami with his wife and two children, he still manages to find time to tour the nation with his rock band, the Rock Bottom Remainders, whose members include such authors as Stephen King and Amy Tan.

Though the tickets for the dinner are $10 for students and $35 for faculty, an additional $15 will buy a copy of Barry's latest book, "Peter and the Starcatchers," a children's book about Peter Pan.

Additional tickets are $100 for sponsors and $250 for benefactors.

Headline: Schizophrenia tells Brazil's legacy of brutality through heavy music
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the early '80s, deep in the Amazon of South America, a savage sound arose from the grave in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The crushing of skulls, roaring of thunder, and howling of beasts traveled the land for many years, unknown to the world; This secret would soon take the globe by storm.

Members of the Brazilian Thrash-Metal band Sepultura were already considered local heroes by the time of their '87, second official release, Schizophrenia. To many, it is considered the rawest and most important album in the band's history. The addition of former Pestilence guitar wizard Andres Kisser (replacing Jario Guedez) and a more progressive, complex sound, showed a side of the band that had never been seen.

Schizophrenia was originally released only in the band's native Brazil. Due to record company conflicts, an estimated 30,000 tapes were bootlegged throughout the European and American underground metal scenes. Though the band didn't receive compensation for the counterfeit sales, they achieved a broader fame than any other Brazilian band at the time, quickly becoming one of the most legendary bands in all of Thrash-Metal. 

Schizophrenia explodes with 13 purely savage tales of endless down notes and riffs that are anything but forgiving. Opening with the theme from the horror thriller "Psycho," the band's trademark haunting acoustic intro, "The Abyss," easily sends shivers down your spine. Tracks like, "Escape to the Void," "Inquisition Symphony," and the thrash anthem, "Troops of Doom," are played with an intensity that will make your head explode.

Max Cavalera growls bestial vocals into the microphone while younger brother Igor stampedes the double-bass drum in the background, like crushing skulls, using fully grown trees as drumsticks. Paulo Jr. shakes the earth with powerful bass rumbles, beating the strings like a tell tale heart of doom. 

Andres Kisser brings a sinister and complex attack of euphoric notes to the band's already vicious sound. He is supposedly one of the many reasons that they ditched their previous Slayer/Venom-inspired satanic, metal sound, for broader, more technical guitar driven patterns and socially conscious lyrics about issues surfacing in Brazil at the time."To the Wall" protests against war, showing the band's concern about government and politics.

Along with a new progressive sound and new way of thinking, Sepultura matured as a whole. The extra time spent in the production booth editing and fine tuning increased the overall quality of the album. The sound is crisper. Their playing doesn't sound hollow and distant like on previous releases. The clarity of the vocals and strumming of strings is stronger. 

All of these changes, some skeptics might think, would retard the band's gritty thrash sound. This is not so, in fact they allowed for the addition of bonus tracks and demo mixes: "The Past Reborns the Storms," "Septic Schizo" and "To the Wall."

Sepultura has always had at least one or two instrumentals for the hardcore head banger. "Inquisition Symphony" and the rough mix of "To the Wall," get the adrenalin rushing. 

All coherent thoughts are thrown out the window as the volume is turned up all the way in a burst of chaotic frenzy. The album ends, kamikaze-style, into an empty swimming pool of down notes, only to pull up at the last minute.

Subheadline: Gadget: 'Wave' of the future or just entertainment?
Author: Richard Seven / The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
Ever get the feeling your body isn't quite up for today's scheduled workout? I feel that way almost daily now. But you must also have those days when you feel more capable than what your training regimen calls for. I get that once in a blue moon.

So when I learned of a high-tech gadget that claims to give athletes an inside peek into when the body is primed for action or in need of rest, I jumped at the chance.

The device, OmegaWave, tests your physiological systems in just a few minutes while you're resting on your back. No treadmill tests or blood draws. Just metal clamps on ankles and wrists, and a few electrodes fastened to your chest.

The test measures the functioning of the central nervous system, as well as cardiopulmonary, hormonal and detoxification systems. It monitors heart rates and slow brain waves and produces personal data in the form of graphs, charts and advice. Essentially, the process is like the diagnostic systems check mechanics would perform on your car's engine to make sure it's running smoothly.

Scientists of the former Soviet Union developed the OmegaWave. Some of them moved to Eugene, Ore., and began a company called OmegaWave Technologies. The device has been on the market about four years and is used by universities from Stanford to Duke, college, professional and international amateur teams, and individual athletes, like one who used it to prep for the Olympics. Researchers use it, as do companies developing sports nutrition.

Company president Allen Huffstutter said three systems are being used in Washington - two by athletic clubs. A Seattle-area doctor is using the system to do fibromyalgia research. Some potential users are still waiting for more independent testing.

The device can cost as much as $35,000. The Bellingham Athletic Club in Washington got one three years ago and uses it to screen new members, help plan and monitor training programs and complement programs targeting weight loss, says Cathy Buckley, club owner. "We've actually sent members to the doctor after we found abnormal heart and stress readings with the device," she says.

Joel Jamieson, director of EndZone Athletics in Kirkland, Wash., has administered the OmegaWave tests to former University of Washington football star Reggie Williams, kick boxers, Seahawks and other elite athletes. The system lets each assess how his or her body is responding and adapting to training. It can be used to shape protocol, too, including when the body needs recovery time.

"An athlete like (Seahawk fullback) Heath Evans, or any athlete, is interested in making sure their body is responding properly to their training and that their bodies are going to be in optimal condition when they need them to be during the season," Jamieson says.

But can it help us normal folk? My test wound up with several pages of graphs and colorful charts about my various internal systems. The stack included an overall evaluation: Central nervous system: sufficient resistance to physical and psychic loads. Gas exchange and cardiopulmonary system: early indication of hyperfunction. Detoxification system: tendency toward overload. Hypothalamic-hypophysical-adrenal systems: Insignificant hypofunction. It also assessed my reactions, which was my only mark that gave me pride.

Jamieson explained it was just a snapshot of what was going on that particular day. Such results, he says, provide a baseline for future testing and for developing individualized training_also based on goals, lifestyle and training experience. That individualized method is safer and brings faster results, he said.

He typically charges $100 for the first consultation, which includes interpreting the results and setting up a training plan. Pricing for follow-up tests varies, but generally cost about $25.

Is such a device necessary? Some think so, some not. Is it something we civilians could gain from? Huffstutter says yes. The OmegaWave measures and interprets adaptation and reaction to stress, something many of us don't have a feel for. And we lack the body-awareness, time and even-keel approach that true athletes have. 

In fact, the system is being used in Holland by a researcher who is studying corporate burnout.
