Headline: Coaches meet to promote cross-town rivalry
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Coach Don Strock and University of Miami coach Larry Coker met July 27 at Bernie's Steakhouse to promote the first football game between the two schools. The newly minted cross-town rivalry will be played on Oct. 14 at the Orange Bowl.

"I think it's going to be a great game and the start of a great series for both schools as well as for the City of Miami," Coker said at the media event. "It gives us a seventh home game on our schedule and it will be one for the fans of FIU. This is a positive in so many ways for local football fans and it will only get bigger and better. We are very excited about it."

The Golden Panthers enter their fifth football season, as well as their first as a fully bowl-eligible Division I-A program, and the excitement is spreading throughout the FIU Community.

"I can't begin to tell you the amount of excitement this has caused among FIU alumni and our students," Strock said. "And it is important for the entire community to understand the value of this game as to the promotion of college football. We both have players who competed with and against one another in high school. To these kids, it's already a tremendous rivalry."

Strock also believes that the game against Miami, along with other games against top Division I-A programs, will be valuable in the recruiting process for FIU.

"Our schedule over the next several years features some of the top teams from around the country," Strock said. "But when you talk to a lot of the recruits we are pursuing, the one game they all really look at is the University of Miami. That shows you the important of having an elite program like them on our schedule."

UM also announced that the Oct. 14 match up will be "High School Day" at the Orange Bowl. High school students and athletes will receive free admission to the game.

"I want to thank the University of Miami for giving FIU the opportunity to play an elite football program and one of the most respected programs in this country," Strock said. "The potential for local and national exposure surrounding this game is amazing."

Headline: BLINDED BY PASSION:
Subheadline: Fans fail to realize the realities that sports bring
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
They are our modern day gladiators, we cry and suffer with them in their defeats and cheer and celebrate in their victories as if they were ours.

Our society has an infatuation with sports and athletes that can be considered border line obsessive. 

I bet a lot of people in Miami had their hearts ripped out when Allan Houston hit that game-winning, running jump shot against the Heat in the 1998 playoffs. 

The night Ohio State defeated Miami in the 2002 Fiesta Bowl (and I still believe till this day that Ohio State stole the game from Miami), all of Miami wanted to kill the referee who called pass interference on Antrel Rolle.

How many times on Real TV have you seen soccer fans in Europe or South American go bonkers after a player missed the winning kick? 

It's insane, yet we want our athletes to be just as passionate as we are.

Remember now, I don't think running sprints and dills in the 100 degree weather half of the year is all that fun. Imagine if someone at your job got upset at you because you weren't passionate at your job like they are.

Come on now, let's try and put all of this into proper perspective. 

Too often in sports, ours eyes and hearts deceive us into thinking of what is happening even though it is not really happening.

Many would say that Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath was one of greatest at his position. Among all of the quarterback in the Hall of Fame, he has some of the worst statistics. In his career, he threw more interceptions (220) than touchdowns (173). Yet the only memory of Broadway Joe that everyone remembers is him guaranteeing a victory in Super Bowl III over the Baltimore Colts and actually delivering.

Then there's the overused phrase of players being called clutch. 	

Everyone loves to throw the word around. How did we ever decide New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter was clutch, just because of a couple of plays? That's ridiculous. 

His career regular season batting average is .314 with OBP of .386 and slugging percentage of .461. Now compare that with his post season statistics: .307 batting average, 379 OBP, .463 slugging percentage.  Not so clutch anymore.

Why isn't A-Rod considered clutch as well? His regular season batting average is only ten points lower during the postseason. It boggles my mind. 

And for the Yankee fans and everyone to get on this guy makes no sense. I laugh every time I hear someone say A-Rod's having a down year, and that he's slumping. If slumping means I'm batting .280 with 22 homeruns and 73 RBIs a little over halfway through the season, I'll take it.

It ultimately comes back to the money and people's unrealistic expectations. How many can fans called A-Rod greedy for accepting a $264 million contract from the Rangers? I don't remember anyone putting a gun to the Texas Rangers owner Thomas Hicks to dish out that kind of money, why not call Hicks greedy; remember, owners are billionaires, while players are only millionaires. 

People cry bloody murder when they hear about athletes cheating, beating their wives or driving while intoxicated. Fans begin to rumble and groan and put those athletes up with the likes of Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Michael Jordan and so forth.

What they fail to realize that many of the greats in sports aren't great people. Detroit Tiger Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was considered a racist; Mickey Mantle would always drink and party the night before a game, Babe Ruth hung former New York Yankees owner Colonel Jacob Ruppert over the rail of a moving train. There are even stories about Mantle going into the clubhouse a little hung-over. For people to say that sports aren't pure anymore is ludicrous.  

News flash, never was. 

Baseball is one of the rare sports that encourages, cheating is almost part of the game. Fans and managers would often get on players for not trying to gain the "competitive edge."  Gaylord Perry was throwing spitballs for years until baseball outlawed the pitch.

In an article by David Sisler of Agape Press, former Florida Marlins' manager Jack McKeon was cited for outright cheating.  In a game against one of the Los Angles Dodgers farm teams in the Pacific Coast League, McKeon told groundskeepers to move first base back a foot. Thus the opponent had to run 91 feet instead of 90 feet to first.

"You have to maneuver things around so your club has an advantage," McKeon said to the Agape Press.

At least Grampa Jack see's things clearly.

Subheadline: Politics should not sacrifice education
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
U.S. District Judge Alan Gold's July 24 ruling may finally bring the Vamos a Cuba censorship debate to its long-overdue end. In his ruling, Gold established that the Miami-Dade County School Board "abused its discretion in a manner that violated the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment"' and issued a preliminary injunction ordering that the 24 books be returned the library shelves by July 31. 

This lawsuit, which has already cost the School Board an estimated $25,000, should be put to rest as soon as possible. 

It is an insult to the intelligence and judgment of the parents of Miami-Dade elementary students - not to mention the American tradition of free speech - that the question of whether the books should be removed from circulation was up for discussion at all. 

Juan Amador Rodriguez and the School Board's objections to Vamos a Cuba are grounded on allegations that the book misrepresents life in Cuba and contains inaccuracies about the political and social situation in that country. 

Such objections are absurd, given that Vamos a Cuba is one in a series of books intended for 5 to 10-year-old children and whose content is deliberately apolitical. The book contains descriptions of Cuban food, dress and traditions, but remains silent on social and political issues. 

The book's flaw, the School Board argues, lies in that it fails to denounce the hardships and injustices of life under Castro's regime. Their objection, then, is not related to the book's ideology, but rather to its lack thereof. 

The School Board's demands in this respect are unreasonable. Political indoctrination, whether it is pro or anti-Castro, is inappropriate content for an illustrated children's book. To include anti-Castro statements in such a book would be out of place. Now, we are all for sticking it to the leaders of oppressive totalitarian regimes; however, children's books are not the place for that.

 Even if ideology were present in Vamos a Cuba, that should not be grounds for its removal from school libraries. 

The principle of free speech is grounded on the assumption that each person - in this case, each student or parent - should be exposed to all sides of an issue and thus be allowed to make up his or her own mind

By banning objectionable political opinions, the School Board is aping the practices of the same regime it is criticizing.  Out of all the different ways we can react toward totalitarianism, suppressing free speech is the least appropriate.

The July 24 court decision allows us the opportunity for the Vamos a Cuba episode to remain a brief, though embarrassing, chapter in Miami-Dade's legal and educational history. This will not happen easily, however, if former School Board member and senatorial hopeful Frank Bolaños has his way. 

Bolaños has stated that he intends to lead the School Board in an appeal of the District Court ruling. His premise for doing so is that "a school board has a right to protect taxpayer dollars and not misuse them on a book that is clear propaganda." 

A cursory glance at the book is enough to establish that it contains nothing similar to propaganda, and his concern for saving taxpayer dollars is hardly sincere. The appeal process could stretch for years and cost the School Board an estimated $250,000. 

In appealing, Bolaños is more concerned with politics than with education. Earlier this month, he resigned from the School Board, citing his intention of running for legislative office against fellow Republican Senator Alex Villalobos. 

By championing the anti-Castro cause, Bolaños hopes to garner the support of Cuban-American voters in his upcoming electoral campaign.

If his concern were truly maintaining the integrity of the educational environment of Miami-Dade's schoolchildren, his willingness to pursue the appeals process would not be so worrisome. 

It is shameful, however, that he is carelessly willing to dispense with the School Board's time and money - and undermine the foundations of the First Amendment - in order to further his personal political aims.

Headline: Moral grounds for stem cell veto don't hold water
Author: Roque Corona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
After being in office for five and a half years, President George W. Bush has finally used his veto power to reject a Senate initiative that proposed opening additional federal funds for research on embryonic stem cells, saying that it "crossed a moral boundary." 

The advantages of federally funded stem cell research, however, far outweigh the moral qualms of those opposed to it, and the majority of the American public supports it. What's more, the logic behind Bush's decision to run contrary to the public's wishes do not hold any water. 

In 2001 Bush became the first president to make federal funds available for stem cell research. The funds were only made available, however, for research on stem cell lines that had already been opened prior to his decision. 

Despite Bush's good intentions, the 78 stem cell lines that were opened proved to be unsuitable for research. The new bill he vetoed would have allowed for federally funded research using excess embryos from fertility clinics - embryos that would otherwise be thrown out.

 With Bush's veto, embryos will now be exempt from scientific research, but they will still be destroyed.

There seems to be a pretty big logical problem in this situation - it's acceptable to conduct research on embryos that have already been destroyed, but unacceptable to conduct research on embryos that will eventually be destroyed. Wouldn't it be more logical to allow these embryos to be used for research than to throw them out as if they were trash?

The private sector has already donated a tremendous amount of funds towards embryonic stem cell research. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger even authorized a $150 million loan to fund California's stem cell institute. 

The private funding of stem cell research only helps to confirm the hypocrisy of Bush's position. The president has stated that his objection to embryonic stem cell research is that 'murder is wrong', though he has done nothing to prohibit or regulate stem cell research being conducted with private funds. So then murdering embryos is both right and wrong, it just depends who picks up the check? 

More to the point, it seems that the accusations of immorality in this debate are misdirected.  

Those opposed to embryonic stem cell research say that it would be immoral to destroy one life in order to save another. Embryos, however, may be alive from a scientific point of view, as a cluster of cells, but they aren't alive in the same way we are. They are not yet human life. Rather, they have the potential for human life.

In any case, morality is on the side of using embryos for stem cell research, as it would help save lives and cure disease. President Bush may embrace children born from frozen embryos, but he turns his back on the paralyzed and diseased that could benefit from those embryos that would otherwise be thrown out. If anything is immoral, it is to forsake the sick for the benefit of the unborn.

The president's veto caused uproar among affiliates of both parties alike. Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado called Bush's veto "a sad sidebar in a debate that has been about ethical scientific research and hope," in the Washington Post.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist told the New York Times, "I am pro-life, but I disagree with the president's decision." 

He also went on to say, "Given the potential of this research and the limitations of the existing [human embryonic stem cell] lines eligible for federally funded research, I think additional lines should be made available."

There are clearly supporters on both sides of the political arena, and the majority on either side is for federally funded embryonic stem cell research. 

Moreover, according to a recent ABCNEWS/Beliefnet poll, 60 percent of Americans support federally funded stem cell research as well. If this is actually the case, is President Bush justified in voting against federal funding towards stem cell research? Shouldn't the majority opinion out rule his desire to please the religious conservatives? 

If President Bush wishes to go against the wishes of most American taxpayers and dash thousands of medical patients' hope for a cure, he should at least come up with a more convincing reason for doing so.

Headline: Senior accountant retires after 31 years
Author: Reuben Pereira / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Marisa Rodriguez, senior accountant for the Student Government Association Activity & Service Fees Business Office, retired this week after 31 years of service to the University and Campus Life. The Beacon sat down with Rodriguez for an interview, on August 1, before a farewell dinner honoring her services to the institution.

Q: When did you begin your tenure at FIU?

A: I began working at FIU at the end of 1975. I had started here, working at the comptroller's office. In 1981, I was transferred to the Student Government Association and made in charge of funds. 

Q: Where did you work before FIU and why did you choose FIU?

A: I used to work in the state attorney's office before I came to FIU. Why FIU? Well, it was very close to my home and I didn't want to drive far. I love FIU very much and I felt very close to the students. Working with students kept me young.

Q: What did your position as senior accountant for the Activities and Services office entail?

A: As senior accountant, I was in charge of the Activities and Services business office and supervised four employees. I did the budgeting for departments based on student organization budgeting needs. When I began, the student government only had a $1 million budget. This year's budget stands at around $9 million. So as you can see, it has tripled over the years. As part of my job, I taught students how to work with financial forms and procedures. I developed ways to better serve students. I also created a web based program and workshops for students to help them get better access to the forms they require. 

Q: How has FIU impacted your life?

A: To sum it up in a sentence, FIU has been my home away from home.

Q: What did you enjoy best about your time at FIU?

A: During my time at FIU, I had the opportunity to work with many different students. What I really remember is watching them grow and then later return to visit me with their children and families. It's something that really meant a lot to me.

Q: Why have you decided to retire?

A: A few years ago, I entered the drop program, which is a state based retirement program from the state. You have to retire five years after you enroll in the program. 

Q: Now that you have retired, what do you plan to do?

A: I'm going to be working part time. I plan to take care of my children and my grandchildren. I also plan to get more involved with my church and I look forward to teaching catechism to young children.

Headline: Students, faculty speak out on Castro, Cuba
Author: Yesenia Forte / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Business major Richard Lopez joined thousands of people who flooded the streets of Miami July 31, beeping their horns and waiving flags.

But this wasn't another sporting event celebration. 

Joining thousands of Cuban exiles and Cuban-Americans, Lopez and his family banged their pots and pans in celebration of a possible change in Cuban leadership.

A statement read Monday night on Cuban television by Fidel Castro's secretary Carlos Valenciaga, confirmed that Castro, who took control of Cuba in 1959, temporarily ceded power to his brother Raul Castro after 47 years of absolute rule.

Valenciaga said Castro's condition was apparently due to stress from a heavy work schedule during recent trips to Argentina and eastern Cuba. 

The announcement of Castro's complicated surgery to repair a "sharp intestinal crisis with sustained bleeding" stunned Cubans in Miami, who, like Lopez, poured out to the streets.  

"Being a Cuban American living in Miami, I believe the transfer of power hit the hearts of many Cuban exiles," said Lopez, a junior.

For others, a change in leadership could lead to other things. 



Antonio Jorge, a professor who teaches political economy at FIU suggested that if Castro dies and it becomes a permanent succession Cuba's economy could change.



"There would probably be more foreign investment and an attempt to improve relations with neighbors," Jorge said. "They may very well allow more distribution and businesses to improve the economy and employment. But Raul Castro would not attempt any major political changes."

Many Cubans who were forced to leave the country and leave their families behind still live with the hope of someday returning to their homeland.  

"My grandmother, and most of my cousins, aunts and uncles still live in Cuba," said senior Gisela Castilla, a chemistry major. "I would love it if we could at least visit each other and travel back and forth freely"

Like many FIU students, Castilla was born in the United States after her parents fled from Castro's communist regime in 1979. 

Castro, who is a about two weeks away from his 80th birthday, has not made a public appearance leading many to speculate about the severity of his condition. Unlike Lopez, some students are not ready to celebrate yet.

"I'm not going to get too excited until I know exactly what happened and what is going to happen next," said junior Lindsay Knowles, an Advertising major. "I'm not going to miss him when he's gone though."

According to Cuban television, Fidel Castro released a written statement August 1 saying he was in stable condition and in good spirits. 

Raul Castro, the defense minister who turned 75 in June, did not appear on television either and has not yet made a statement.

"Some people think that because Fidel dies Cuba will be free, but his brother has a lot of power too, so, I don't think it will be that easy," said junior Jahaira Palaez, a Hospitality Management major.

No reports have yet confirmed or denied Castro's death and Jorge predicts that the Cuban government would not do anything to disrupt Castro's communist regime.

"In the very long run nobody knows what will happen, but I don't think that within the next 20 years Cuba will be a capitalist country," Jorge said.

FIU:
FIU hosts student government advisors' conference

Miami-Dade Transit hosted a design workshop for the proposed Metrorail expansion to the University Park. Most residents who attended the July 24 workshop at FIU agreed that the 10.5-mile project would improve mobility and accessibility between major residential, work and activity centers, according to The Miami Herald. The favored concept is an elevated track starting in the Le Jeune Road area and extending west to Southwest 117th Avenue, with five to seven stations along the way. Besides the airport and University, it would serve portions of Miami along State Road 836, Doral and Sweetwater and other unincorporated areas. It's estimated that this project would cost $1.5 billion and take until 2014 to build.



Local:
Controversial book returns to school libraries

Earlier this week, a federal judge ordered all copies of Vamos a Cuba and 23 other children's books returned to Miami-Dade school libraries.

U.S. District Judge Alan Gold said the School Board ``abused its discretion in a manner that violated the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment.''

Gold's ruling was not final, but the preliminary injunction will apply while the American Civil Liberties Union and Student Government Association continue their lawsuit against the School Board. 

The book was brought to the spotlight after the father of a student at a Miami Dade county elementary school found that the book inaccurately described life in Cuba under the Castro regime.

Teenager arrested in highway shooting case

A 17-year-old confessed July 25 to committing a series of highway shootings that killed one man, wounded another and damaged at least four vehicles in Indiana, authorities say. Blanton was arrested July 26 and was jailed in Jackson County. He faces preliminary charges of murder, attempted murder and criminal recklessness, according to prosecutor Stephen Pierson.

Headline: Tourism program attracts Irish students
Author: Samir Ahmed / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Before arriving in Miami last month, four students from the National University of Ireland Galway packed their suitcases and embarked a plane to Miami, where they would stay for six weeks.  

The group, which included Gillian Drake, 21, Shanna Kenny, 20, Carol Stephens, 21 and Edel Byrne, 20, came to Miami June 4, but they weren't traveling thousands of miles to soak up the sun. 

These students traveled to represent the Birr Convention and Visitor's Bureau, which is a newly formed association that deals with promoting tourism and organizing conventions in their hometown of Birr, Ireland.

"The convention models in Miami are among the best in the United States," Kenny said.

That's one reason the group picked Miami as their education destination. 

Another reason was FIU's Hospitality and Management School, which is ranked among the top five hospitality programs in the nation. 

When the students arrived at FIU, they had nowhere to go, but thanks to a fellow Irishman by the name of Professor William Quin, they were quickly moved to the Bay Vista dorm rooms, which overlook the Biscayne Bay.

Their accomodations are funded by  Ted Conrad, the financial advisor for the Birr Convention and Visitor's Bureau.

"Everyone's very welcoming here, and they have made it such a pleasurable experience," Drake said.

A typical day consists of everyone getting into the office at 9:30 a.m. and working a full day that sometimes goes on until about 7 p.m. 

Pay isn't exactly something they had in mind when joining the research program. The students work as volunteers.

Kenny and the other students have been extremely busy attending classes on Convention Management, Event Management and Convention Marketing. 

These classes are proving to be the foundation of their studies, which are supplementing what they've already learned about tourism in Miami.

Along with the study of all the conventions in Miami, these students are also in charge of collecting information that is then put into a database that holds over 300 associations. 

Their goal is to put together sales letters and get associations to come to Birr and host conventions held there.

Adding to the workload, the students are also responsible for getting together brochures and skimming through websites for research. 

Although much of their stay has been business related, they have also enjoyed much of the scenery. 

They've traveled to Key West, Orlando, Naples, Tampa Bay, the Bahamas and Orlando. 

They say these trips have proven to be very educational as they allowed for opportunities to meet with experts in the hospitality and management field.

Although these trips were very educational, they also gave the girls from Ireland a chance to go sightseeing. 

"The weather's great and the beaches are magnificent," Kenny said.

One thing that the students do miss most about their hometown is the relaxed atmosphere.

All four students are set to depart for Ireland August 15. When they arrive they hope to share their findings with friends and families. 

They also say they've taken a small piece of Miami back with them.

"Ireland is very relaxed, unlike Miami," Drake said. "There is a definite hustle and bustle in a city like this."

Headline: Journalism students create webzine
Author: Yesenia Forte / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On the first day of the 2006 Spring semester, Professor Allan Richards gave his students the task of producing a webzine - a news magazine published on the Internet. 

The result: PulseMiamiNews.com.

PulseMiamiNews.com is an online news magazine developed by students in the online news reporting class in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication.  

The class had three months to design a web page, write stories, take pictures and put it all together.

"I ran this class as a start-up magazine. Because I teach other writing courses in our track, I knew that this particular class had some of the finest writers I had seen pass through the school," said Richards in an article he wrote for "Annenberg's Online Journalism Review."

Seniors Joselle Galis-Menendez and Rochelle Oliver, both journalism majors, volunteered to be co-editors of the magazine.

"I don't know why, but I raised my hand and I'm glad I did," Galis-Menendez said.

FusedOnline was the first big project that Richards did with FIU and it ran for about 18 months.

"PulseMiamiNews is an even bigger experiment than I have tried before," said Interim Department Chair Richards.

The first issue was released April 22 complete with a South Beach launch party. 

All the students donated money to fund the location and Helen Berggren, a staff photographer and print journalism graduate from the school, put together press packages to hand out at the event.

"Our first issue focuses on the arts and politics and the people who make Miami what it is," said Oliver. "We try to write about issues that are especially unique because they can only happen in Miami. Still, many of those issues are international because Miami is international." 

The co-editors embrace individuality and want their staff to be able to express themselves freely. 

"We want each writer to stand out as an individual, which is why we have the blogs," Oliver said.

Next to each byline there is a link to the writer's uncensored blog. 

Each staff member also wrote his or her own bio and had complete control over its outcome. 

The website also has a separate blog section where readers can post comments or write about anything they like.  

Many bloggers have written about where to get bargains on clothes, books or drinks.

"Classes always panic when I say create your own blog site, but it's very easy. Things are getting more accessible and easier for them," Richards said.

Students with an appreciation for food can endulge in the website's Ocho section. Ocho features eight restaurants that serve complete meals for $8 dollars or less. The online newsmagazine is set to produce a new issue every three months.

The students involved with PulseMiaminews.com see this as more than a class project and hope to turn it into a money-making business. While the magazine does get some money from advertising, it hasn't made a profit. 

There aren't a lot of ads on the site because they don't want to overwhelm readers, and any money that is collected goes right back to hosting and marketing.

"I like to help prepare students for the journalism industry," said Richards. "Editors want them to be able to write really well, they want them to be able to think critically, and they want them to have some facility with the new technology," 

The online newsmagazine is set to produce a new issue every three months. 

Editors publishe stories in four different languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese and French.  Stories that are available in another language have a link at the end.

Co-editors welcome new writers and photographers and encourage interested writers to contact them  at LettertotheEditor@PulseMiamiNews.com.

Headline: Impact Movement club promotes God, religion
Author: Samuel Hyppolite / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Marline Polissaint-Vil first thought about creating the Impact Movement club, she envisioned a highly spiritual organization that offered students a chance to get closer to God. 

During the summer of 2001, Polissaint-Vil, the founder of the first Impact Movement in Miami, felt that students at FIU had been left out from such a spiritual club. The club is an evangelism and discipleship organization on college campuses around the United States and in South Africa and began as a conference in 1991. 

"The Impact Movements were held in some other states and cities around the United States, but there had never been one in Miami prior to this one," said Polissaint-Vil, now an alumna. "After I attended an Impact Movement event in Georgia, the messages inspired me to create one at the Biscayne Bay Campus."

Now, the organization encompasses the mission and vision of movement by reaching the souls of thousands of African American college students today including those at BBC.

Polissaint-Vil believed that an Impact Movement was important at BBC after reflecting on the existence of humans and the lack of an undefined and true meaning of life for people who don't believe in God.

"It is sad to see how many people die a couple of days or months after graduating," she said. "All their sacrifices are lost after death, but those who give priority to God's word will never lose." 

 Although Polissaint-Vil is no longer the president of the movement's BBC branch, the organization continues to exist under the leadership of senior Jamila Rauf and Bill Hansen, the club's advisor.

"The primary goal of the Impact Movement is to bring the Gospel to the campus, to the community, and to the world," Rauf said. 

Rauf highlights her work at BBC with stories from the Bible.

"Talking about Jesus is very important to BBC students because they may not have access to a church and may find fulfillment by coming to the meetings," Rauf said. "Their salvation is very important to us." 

There are currently about 25 members in the organization and there are three major factors that contribute to the club's low attendance, according to Vice-president, Jovan Rauf.

"Class schedule and pressures are probably the main reasons why some students don't show up or come inconsistently to the meetings," Jovan Rauf said.

A lack of religious belief or different religions may also be part of the attendance problem, according to Jovan Rauf.

"Different views about religion are also important to take into account when analyzing what may contribute to the lack of participation of students to the meetings," Jovan Rauf said.

In order to create a balance between religion and social life, the Impact Movement meetings are not entirely about the Gospel. 

Reginald Jean-Gills, a member of Impact Movement, said that many other beneficial subjects are discussed during the meetings in order to welcome all kinds of students.

Headline: Students can now access parking services online
Author: Yesenia Forte / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Department of Parking and Transportation now has a 24-hour online system, allowing students to renew their decals through the website.

"The new e-Business system will allow [students], hopefully, to stay away from having to go into the office," said Bill Foster, Director of Parking and Transportation at FIU. "Of course, they still have that option if they prefer dealing person to person, but most people don't." 

All student decals expire August 31.  The parking decal is necessary to park any vehicle on campus without being subject to ticketing.  

Students enrolled at FIU pay $56.50  as a semester for a parking and transportation access fee. The fee is included in each student's tuition. 

No additional charges apply when the decal is obtained through the website and the decal is mailed to the student. 

Students can access the website at http://parking.fiu.edu and sign in with their Panther ID and birth date to create a password and access all the features, which also include ticket appeals and payments.

"I think it's a great idea," said Wolfgang Acevedo, Student Services Chair for the University Park Student Government Association. "Every year there are 30,000 decals handed out to students. This is more convenient." 

About 85 percent of the students enrolled at University of Florida get their decals online, and at Florida State University, probably 90 percent go online to get their decals, according to Foster. 

"Fifty percent is our goal this year, and that would keep 15,000 people from standing in line," Foster said.

Some freshmen entering the school have attended orientation and have already gone online to order their decals after registering for classes. 

The new system, which was implemented in February, cost an estimated $150,000. The money was acquired through student fees, duplicate decals, parking meters and fines, according to Foster

Each student's information was transferred in order to link the system with all the information the University already had before e-Business became active July 17. 

"We had to learn how to use a brand new system and had to go through PeopleSoft and PantherSoft," Foster said. "It was a huge undertaking and a very collaborative effort with UTS, Admissions, the controller's office and many others." 

When students register through PantherSoft, the system will recognize them as registered students and they can then go onto the parking website and insert their vehicle and registration information to order a decal. 

Returning students' information will already be in the system.

Faculty and staff will not have access to the online system until next year, but they can still take advantage of the Department of Parking and Transportation offices to resolve any issues in person.  

At UP, offices are located in the Gold, Blue and Red parking garages. The Biscayne Bay Campus office is located in the Wolfe University Center 353. 

There will be a student Parking and Transportation Forum Sept. 13 in GC 140 at UP. Bill Foster will be there to take questions from students with any transportation concerns or issues. Food and beverages will be served too. 

"We really want a lot of students to come out and voice their opinions," Acevedo said.

Headline: Butterflies, plants found at University preserve

Orange and black striped butterflies flutter over a red-flowered Scarlet Bush. They slurp the flower's nectar for the energy needed to flap away from potential predators. But this isn't a scene from the local zoo, it's happening at the University Park's Nature Preserve.

The Heliconius butterflies, as they are called, can be found flying around the east entrance of the preserve between the Hardwood Hammock Trail and the Pineland at University Park.

To protect the Scarlet Bush from unwarranted intruders, a stonewall barrier runs along the Preserve. This butterfly garden attracts hundreds of butterflies everyday that float around the flowers and plants that make up the garden. 

FIU's latest project for the Nature Preserve is known as the Preserve Butterfly Garden and has been organized by the Department of Environmental Studies. 

"The Preserve is an amazing part of nature that this campus is fortunate to have," said George O'Brien, a professor from the Department of Education in Science and one of the preserve's volunteers.

Jack Parker, a professor from the Department of Environmental Studies, established the Preserve in 1978. He is affectionately known as the father of the Nature Preserve. 

However, the Butterfly Garden wasn't built until about two years ago. Michael P. O'Brien, a former student from Cooper City High School, along with other volunteers helped build the garden as part of an Eagle Scout project. 

With the help of his father, George O'Brien, he was able to build an addition to the Preserve, the Butterfly Garden.

"I immediately gave my son the idea of creating his project within the preserve," he said. "Since my 18 years of working at FIU, I have taken my students to the Preserve as an educational teaching."

Michael O'Brien and the volunteers removed exotic plants in order to plant butterfly attracting plants, such as the Scarlet Bush. 

Tom Pliske, a professor from the Environmental Studies department, helped as the "butterfly expert." Since the garden's establishment, he has observed about 45 different species of butterflies in the garden. 

At the garden, there are 12 informational points that are located next to a butterfly-attracting plant that is marked by a butterfly sign. 

These informational points are used as a guide to present an overview of the plants found in the garden. There are also booklets for visitors that can be used as an educational resource to learn more about the garden and its butterflies. 

"The booklets are really neat," said senior Eva Salazar. "I like going point by point and following along in my booklet. It gives me a better understanding of what to observe."

Students who volunteer, as well as advocates of the environmental studies department, whom are the caretakers of the garden, maintain the Preserve. 

Several of the plants have and continue to be donated by organizations such as Fairchild Tropical Garden and the Broward Chapter of the Florida Native Plants Society. 

"It's a beautiful, peaceful and  public site," said junior Rayxa Mendez. "I visit the Butterfly Garden every so often after my classes. It's a place I enjoy going to when I need to take my mind off of studies and I know I can enjoy the peacefulness of the nature." 

The Preserve is located west of the Panther Hall dorms and south of the Pharmed Arena. 

For more information about the Preserve Butterfly Garden or how you can become involved, you can either contact Professor George O'Brien at obrieng@fiu.edu or visit http://www.fiu.edu/~envstud/preserve/.

Headline: Mexican flea market offers authentic food, art
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Hurricane Andrew may have changed the face of the Homestead area, but that doesn't mean there aren't unique experiences to be had. Redland Market Village Bargain Town and Flea Market, looming over the bareness of South Dixie Highway, offers an authentic Mexican culinary experience coupled with the bustle of the flea and farmers market atmosphere.

This weekend-only market draws people from all walks of life all ready to immerse themselves in flea market buys, farmers market fare and flavorsome Mexican food. Cars creep into the parking lot all searching for parking at the busy Redland. Those who frequent this market suggest arriving early to beat the crowd.

The main flea market area houses hundreds of vendors selling anything from artisan and gold jewelry to clothing and knock-off athletic shoes. Prices are sometimes marked, but haggling is still a skill any patron should bring along.

Next door sits the farmers market where consumers can purchase fresh fruits, vegetables and even Mexican cheeses. 

This market is the perfect place to find items that are sometimes hard to find at your local supermarket. One may find themselves holding up vegetable oddities, like the hairy taro root or the wrinkly chayote gourd, while wondering what on earth they are supposed to do with them. 

One vendor devotes his product to an extensive array of dried chilies, everything from the mouth-searing habanero to the characteristically Mexican poblano and the mild cubanelle. Most of the produce is grown right in Homestead, making the trip from the farm to the market a short one.

They say that the heart of the home is the kitchen and respectively the heart of Redland Market is its row of food stands. These taquerias offer patrons authentic and tasty options such as soft shell tacos, tostadas and the traditional Mexican menudo soup.

Menudo, a soup made from chili, tripe and hominy, is a favorite among customers, especially those who are native Mexicans. This soup arrives at the table gleaming with its characteristic crimson red color and glistening fats from the tripe; a dish not for the health conscious but nonetheless carrying with it a distinct and flavorful quality.

If menudo is not your style other more mainstream choices are offered. Their soft shell tacos are a basic but appetizing choice. 

Although a variety of meats can be nestled inside these handmade flour tortillas, the barbacoa is a must-try. This beef, taken from the cheeks of cows, is traditional Mexican fare on Sunday mornings and at Redland can be stuffed inside their tacos. Steamed to perfection, the barbacoa offers an amazing slow-cooked flavor coupled with tender meat. 

Once at your table it can be crowned with a variety of toppings from lettuce to onions and freshly diced jalapenos. Don't forget to add their garden-fresh pico de gallo, a diced medley of onions, tomatoes, cilantro and peppers. A squeeze of lime juice polishes off these tacos.

These taquerias are not the only locations to get great food at great prices. Dotted among vendors are smaller stalls that offer customers foods that can be nibbled on while perusing for flea market buys. A popular choice is their elote asado or roasted corn. This corn is slid onto a stick and roasted with the husk still attached. It reaches your hands still warm while a variety of toppings are offered. Mayonnaise, garlic, butter and parmesan cheese all make excellent additions.

A healthy dessert option is offered at an array of stands. In the stifling Miami summers there is nothing more delectable than freshly cooled fruit. Watermelon, coconut, papaya and other fruit choices are chilled over ice waiting for you to enjoy as a remedy to a hot day. Freshly squeezed juices are also available. Their sugarcane juice is a popular option and is perfectly sweet and cool in the Homestead heat.

Flea market finds, Mexican food and farmers market fare are not the only reasons to enjoy Redland Market. Energetic Mexican music plays over speakers while friendly waiters and vendors happily attend to your needs. Redland Market may be far from the posh streets of South Beach but it will offer a genuine experience that is hard to forget.

Headline: Students sell books for quick cash
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Saving books related to specific majors is certainly a wise idea, but as much as you may have enjoyed that class in world religion, more than likely you won't be re-visiting the textbook's pages anytime soon. Instead, you can sell your unneeded books for some extra cash.

There are several ways to sell your textbooks, and some options are more effective than others in grabbing potential buyers' attentions. One method is handing out and placing flyers around campus. 

However, its effectiveness is limited in terms of attracting students' considerations.

Junior Johnny Betancourt finds he rarely looks at the flyers on campus advertising books for sale so he feels he should not put them up either.

"I don't put up signs because it's easier to sell [books] online since you get much better exposure," Betancourt said.

Better exposure, in fact, seems to be only one of the benefits of online selling. Not only do you instantaneously acquire potential buyers from around the nation and world, but also the percentage received of the original prices appears to be relatively high. 

However, selling on Amazon.com might not be the best option since the website withholds 15 percent of the selling price, plus an additional variable closing fee. 

However, students have been known to get hard-to-beat offers when selling on Half.com, which Betancourt can vouch for.

"I've gotten up to 70 percent of the original price of my books back by selling on Half.com," Betancourt said. 

Drawbacks of online selling include waiting for the item to sell, as well as time spent in packaging and shipping.

For students who would prefer a faster, hassle-free method, the two best options are selling back to the FIU bookstore or to Booksmart across the street from University Park. Many students make purchases from Booksmart at the beginning of the semester because of its reputation for reasonable prices on textbooks. But how do they compare to our school bookstore when it comes to selling back? 

Booksmart employee Jorge Guerrero calls their store convenient because it accepts buy-backs all year-round. 

"If students come right at the end of the semester, they can get up to 50 percent back," Guerrero said.  "If they wait, they can get anywhere from 5 to 25 percent back." 

Senior Reshma George has received good deals from Booksmart as well. 

"You get more money across the street than at the bookstore," George said. "Booksmart gave me $52 for my business book, instead of $30." 

Rumors have recently circulated that the FIU bookstore is now offering 50 percent back on all books, even after the immediate end of the semester. Even if this were true, George concluded after some thought that it would make little difference. 

"I'd only get a little more for the business book with the bookstore's new offer," George said. 

Such hearsay, however, turns out to be unfounded, as FIU Bookstore employee senior Mario Funk clarifies.

"When we offer 50 percent back, it's for books that we call 'adopted,'" Funk said. "When professors adopt books it means they've ordered them for the next semester … We have a budget to buy back an 'x' amount of books. If you're here Finals Week and the first two weeks of the next semester, usually you'll get your 50 percent back. It depends on the book, and the demand for the book." 

This policy has made the bookstore a stronger competitor, which students have begun to notice.

"I was surprised by how much I got from the bookstore just now," said senior Oriane Lluch. "The original price of my book was $50. I paid $30 for it online and got $25 back."

Headline: Miami Vice stylishly portrays city, but lacks substance
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assistant News Director
&nbsp;
The first thing I should mention about the film adaptation of "Miami Vice," the popular television series from the '80s, is its setting. The 2006 film isn't set in the '80s, the pastel jackets have gone and so has the fantastic soundtrack. 

In fact, the film barely resembles the television show. It just seemed like director Michael Mann was trying to distance himself from the show. 

Apart from the character names and the film's title, there isn't anything that reminds you of the show. Why call the film Miami Vice in the first place?

What's left is a dark, gritty action drama that is ironically all style and no substance. It's all style in regards to the beautifully shot locales, fancy cars and designer outfits. It's no substance in regards to the film having a run-of-the-mill plot that barely thrills and entertains. 

Where's the fun? Where's the excitement? Nowhere in this movie, that's for sure. 

The film is stylish, looks fantastic and has sparks of great action, but as the fim went on,  I just didn't seem to care about any of the characters or even the plot.

The film has a lame plot involving the "been there, done that" re-thread of cops infiltrating the underworld to catch criminals.

When we meet Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx), they're undercover at a Miami nightclub. Before long, they're called into work on an FBI case gone wrong. It involves a large drug trafficker from Colombia (how original!) who always seems to be one step ahead of everyone's game. 

It's up to Crockett and Tubbs to go deep undercover and drill him out from the inside. On the way, Crockett ends up falling for the drug lord's mistress/right-hand woman, which complicates things. Yawn! Haven't we seen and heard this story before? Yet, despite having a mundane and relatively simple plot, it is still hard to follow and keep track of. 

Michael Mann is a world-renowned director, known for his crime dramas such as Heat and Collateral. It's baffling how he could create a film this uninteresting. 

What's more disappointing is that he was the executive producer of the original "Miami Vice" television series. 

As one disappointed audience member stated as the end credits rolled, "The film was Bad Boys without the action, humor or fun." Yes, Bad Boys isn't what you would define as a top notch quality film, but at least it was fun to watch. If my memory serves me right, there wasn't a single laugh in Miami Vice, at least intentionally.

Not all of the milk is sour as Mann does bring his trademark gritty action and style to the film. The action sequences, short and distant from each other, are very well shot and are realistic, as one would expect from Mann, an auteur of crime films. One sequence involving a hostage situation is the film's most tense scene and is a highlight. 

The film boasts a lot of fast cars, powerboats and slick outfits that are second to none in the style department. The city of Miami is a star in itself. Never has the city looked so beautiful on film. Visually, the film is a stunner. Notch up another point for the case of digital filmmaking. 

Moving on to the acting in the film - although they were both solid in their roles individually, Farrell and Foxx had no on-screen chemistry. It was as if they were in separate movies; it felt like they didn't want to work with each other. Gong Li, as Farrell's love interest was the worst; she was barely understandable. 

That asks another question: What was Gong Li, a Chinese actress, doing in a movie that takes place mostly in Miami, Colombia and the Dominican Republic? There isn't any explanation. Her sole purpose in the film may have been accompanying Farrell in one of many pointless shower scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love shower scenes just as much as the next guy, but these scenes were a distraction.

End Note: Miami Vice has style and makes the city of Miami look gorgeous. However, it lacks substance with its boring plot and lack of action and thrills, thus killing it.

Headline: Miami
Subheadline: Entertainment Business flourishes in White hot city
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assistant News Director
&nbsp;
From the sunny beaches and the Art Deco districts of South Beach to its metropolitan downtown, Miami has always had its share of fun and thrills. However, the city's image as the 'Mecca of cool" has been greatly enhanced in recent years. 

With the current release of Miami Vice, Miami is once again in the Hollywood spotlight.

The list of films and television shows being filmed on location has been increasingly steady over the past few years with the wattage of stars, intensifying in frequency. Similarly, in the music industry, many musicians chose to record in the city and find it convenient to shoot their videos here as well. 



FILMS:
Over the years, Miami has played host to many popular and acclaimed films. Most notable from the long list being Brian DePalma's notorious Scarface (1983), starring Al Pacino. During the film's shooting schedule, the Miami Tourist Board refused to allow the filmmakers to shoot the movie, as they were afraid of the negative reception to the city of Miami and its Cuban immigrants. However, history proved otherwise, as the film became a massive cult hit, especially among the hip-hop community. 

The Bad Boys films, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as detectives, have also made their mark on the city of Miami, showcasing the city's nightclubs and golden beaches. The sequel - filmed in 2003 - was notorious for it's highway chase sequence, which required the temporary shutdown of the McArthur Causeway, which links Miami and South Beach. 

Another film that caused problems for Miami residents was 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), which featured Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes. The popular opening sequence involved two cars jumping over an opening bascule bridge in downtown Miami.

All these productions in Miami not only bring publicity to the city but also bring in income. According to the Miami Today, Miami Vice (2006) is expected to bring in an estimated $30 million in temporary jobs to the Miami-Dade county economy. Bad Boys II had also brought in an estimated $35 million in revenue. 

Other famous films that have been shot in Miami include Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) and The Birdcage (1996), two films shot mostly in Miami Beach. Ace Ventura was Jim Carrey's coming out film, which featured Miami Dolphins legend Dan Marino. In the film, Carrey's character was hired to find the Dolphins kidnapped mascot. 

The Birdcage, with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, was famous for being set at the Art Deco district of South Beach and for highlighting the gay community in the area.



TV:
Of the television shows shot on location in Miami, "Miami Vice" has had the highest profile and impact. 

The pastel suits, the soundtrack, and its reputation for being gritty, made it one of the most influential television shows of the '80s. In fact, the show is credited for giving Miami its tagline as the "mecca of cool." 

With most of its episodes being shot in or around Miami Beach and its Art Deco district, the city pulsed with energy through every episode of the popular Emmy nominated series.

Other notable shows that have been shot and set in Miami have included the highly acclaimed and controversial series "Nip/Tuck," involving two celebrity plastic surgeons and "CSI: Miami," a spin-off of "Crime Scene Investigation." Both shows reveal the seedy underside of Miami, with "Nip/Tuck" taking the cake for the bizarre factor.



MUSIC:
For the past two years, Miami has hosted MTV's highly popular Video Music Awards show. The Video Music Awards have a history of being controversial, unpredictable and wild and Miami's first chapter of the show had its moments. 

The show was almost postponed due to Hurricane Frances hitting the state only days prior. But the show went on as planned with a multitude of stars gracing Miami's AmericanAirlines Arena, many of who arrived via their yachts. 

Many singers and rappers have recorded and shot their videos in Miami. High profile producers such as Timbaland and Scott Storch have studios that attract many celebrities to the city. Artist such as Justin Timberlake, Diddy, Nelly Furtado, Ricky Martin and 50 Cent are among the many who have recorded in Miami.

With the Miami Heat being crowned NBA champions, a new adaptation of the '80s TV series "Miami Vice" in theaters and the city prepping up to play host to television's biggest event, the Super Bowl, in January 2007, Miami will continue to spend more time in the spotlight. Not only will all of this bring in more of the world's finest and talented, it will greatly benefit the economy and face of the city.
