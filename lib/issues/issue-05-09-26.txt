Headline: John G. Roberts nominated to succeed William H. Rehnquist as Chief Justice
Author: Christopher Necuze / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Every few years or so, a member of the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court, either passes away or retires, leaving a vacancy which must be promptly filled. Though the Constitution provides for no exact number of how many members the court must have, traditionally, nine men or women call this bench home. With the retirement of Justice Sandra O'Connor, and the recent passing of Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are now  two vacancies in the court which must be filled.

Nineteen days after Justice O'Connor announced her retirement, President Bush nominated Judge John G. Roberts, Jr. to succeed her. When chief justice William Rehnquist passed away of thyroid cancer, President Bush almost immediately re-nominated Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States; he has yet to nominate another candidate to replace Justice O'Connor.

 The politics involved in confirming another Supreme Court Justice are complicated, as the judge is likely to serve on the court for many years.  In case a vacancy occurs, it is very likely that the president will choose a candidate who shares the same ideological principles as he/she.  

By doing so, the president can feel confident that their political philosophy will persist beyond their term. Conservative Rehnquist's court was a perfect embodiment of President Bush's political ideology, and with John Roberts, the president has chosen  candidates whose political creed most closely resemble that of the late Rehnquist.

"I have no platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain things in exchange for votes ... Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules; they apply them," Roberts said. 

These remarks were made by Roberts on the first day of his confirmation hearings.  Roberts has the right idea. 

 As a nominee, John Roberts will have to face the scrutiny of the Senate Judiciary Committee where his record will be distorted and his statements taken out of context.  

Democrats have called into question Robert's commitment to what the Democratic National Committee (DNC) calls "basic rights". The Senate has received an unprecedented 76,000 documents from the National Archives and Records Administration and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library relating to Roberts' record.  Even so, some Democratic senators, specifically Richard Durbin (IL), as well as the DNC Chairman, Howard Dean (VT), feel that this is not enough.  

These gentlemen call for the release of the classified documents of 16 cases that Roberts worked on while serving as Deputy Solicitor General during the presidency of George H.W. Bush. Aren't those documents protected by the Attorney-Client Privilege? A privilege that protects the rights of both parties.

A quote, from an editorial in the Chicago Tribune, says it best. "Democrats are asking too much. The administration has made available innumerable documents from Roberts' service in the Justice department and the White House Counsel's Office ..." 

Democrats should not be trying to prove that Judge Roberts is a conservative, because he is. They should not subject him to a litmus test based on his position on abortion or other issues. 

The Senate Judiciary Committee needs to decide whether or not John Roberts is capable of assessing the heartbeat, if you will, of the nation.

On the first day of his hearings, Roberts stated over and over again that his job was not to create legislation, but merely to apply it.  

Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, it must be calming to know that he understands the need to be a justice, and not an activist justice.  "I have no agenda; my job is to call balls and strikes," Roberts said

Subheadline: School spirit lacking at pep rallies and home games
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Thursday, Sept. 29 is the start of a new beginning. On this day, FIU will have its first pep rally of the year to celebrate their first home game as a Division I-A team and member of the Sun Belt Conference.

 In prior years, there has been a low attendance rate at pep rallies and, more importantly, games - due to the belief that the football team wasn't on par with state powerhouses Florida State, University of Florida and University of Miami. The team's status as an I- A team proves otherwise. 

Yes, the football team has struggled in the past and is off to a poor start this season, but there is no excuse to not attend the games and pep rallies. Especially now that the team needs  students support in a much tougher league. Apart from Greek organization members who attend the games, not many other students are consistent followers. The team needs some devoted fans who will cheer on the team to the end.

Students will always complain about how FIU doesn't have campus involvement and that there is no school unity, yet it is our responsibility as students to make the most of college. There should be no reason for students to walk around wearing UM or UF caps. Show support for your school and flaunt  FIU caps and shirts.

 If we don't go to pep rallies and games, and don't participate in school events, how is FIU ever going to have good campus activity? If you want things to change: participate! 

The first pep rally of the year is going to be held at the  GC Atrium on Sept. 29. Go support the team. Make the most of your college experience!

Subheadline: Punter helps out where he can
Author: ndoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
As a freshman, he caught passes and returned kickoffs; as a sophomore, he kicked a couple of extra points and served as an emergency quarterback. As a junior, FIU's new punter, Chris Patullo can do it all. During his three-year career as a Golden Panther, Patullo has done everything but make a tackle on defense. The Beacon met up with the multi-talented junior before the team's trip to Jonesboro, ARK. to face Arkansas State. 

Q: Your profile states that you chose FIU over schools such as Dartmouth, the University of Massachusetts and South Florida. Why did you choose to become a Golden Panther?

FIU was the only team that would let me play receiver, quarterback a little bit, and kick. All the other schools wanted me to specialize; just play quarterback or receiver.  

Q: You could be considered the most versatile punter in the country. How does your ability to play three completely different positions benefit this team?

I think so. Letting me do these things saves roster spots compared to someone who only plays receiver or only kicks. I would say that it is definitely a benefit for them.  

Q: If coach Don Strock came up to you tomorrow and asked you where you would like to play, what position would you choose?

Wherever I could help; wherever he needs me, that is why I am here; to do whatever they need me to do.  

Q: What do you think is the biggest problem facing this team as they embark on their first Sun Belt season? 

We have to keep working hard because we played some good, tough teams and we hung in there. We just have to jell together more and play as a team.   

Q: What did the team take out of the first two games of the season playing in front of large Big 12 opponents? 

We have a little work to do. We need to get a little bit better, eliminate our mistakes offensively, we fumbled a few times. Defensively, we need to make some tackles. We could have been in there, but mistakes hurt.  

Q: The team had trouble holding onto leads last season against teams you are facing this year. Have coaches or players addressed this so far this year? What have you done to get past that point?

I think last year had to do with the off-season running program. We didn't run as much as we should have, and we got tired. We would get a big lead and then during the second half, we just couldn't keep it up. We worked on that real hard this summer getting into good shape so we're ready to go.  

Q: You have been around the team for three years now. What do you think is the best indicator that the Golden Panthers will have a smooth transition into Division I-A football?

We have gotten better; most of us have been here three, four, five years. I have been here three, and we have gotten so much better since. Everyone has playing experience; practices are running a lot smoother.   

What was the opinion of players following the release of the Sports Illustrated pre-season poll that ranked FIU #119?   

We kind of saw it coming after the year that we had last year. It just motivated us to work hard and do whatever we could to get better; we have. I don't know what we are ranked now, probably 80-something, but it's making us work a lot harder.

Headline: Hard work and confidence pays off for freshman forward
Author: Joshua Rey / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Freshmen athletes aren't supposed to win games.  

In all sports, they struggle to adjust to college systems and intimidating opponents. Often freshmen will redshirt and sit out their first season.  But when FIU's men's soccer team kicked off its inaugural season in Conference USA with 17 new players, it was clear that the freshmen class was going to have to step up.

Enter Judah Hernandez.  Mild-mannered and soft-spoken,  Hernandez arrived on the scene only one month ago, later than most of his peers who had begun working out with upperclassmen in the summer. 

But he learned the ropes quickly, and following impressive showings off the bench against South Florida and Missouri State, the freshman forward learned that he would be starting versus Florida Atlantic on Sept. 7.  

"I know what I can do," Hernandez said,  "But I honestly didn't expect [to start] so fast.  I knew if I played my game - played as well as I could - that eventually something would happen."

Something did happen, and like most things Judah does, it happened in a flash. After senior Carron Williams scored successive goals to tie the score at two and send the game into overtime, Hernandez made sure his first start would be a memorable one.

"Once we got one goal, I knew we'd get a second. And that third one," Hernandez said,  "Oh, it was magic."

Only 1:27 into overtime, Hernandez scored the first goal of his FIU career to cap an improbable comeback and lead the Golden Panthers to victory over the rival Fighting Owls.  

"I only scored the goal; the rest of the guys did the job. I love playing with those guys," Hernandez said, with a smile. "One of the midfielders stole the ball in the other team's half, played it to another guy (defender Pierre HóSang) and he played a perfect ball to me. If I didn't score, then it would be an injustice to my team who worked so hard to put it there."

Hernandez  put in a lot of hard work to get to that moment. A native of Arima, Trinidad, he could not help falling in love with fútbol.

"In Trinidad, you eat, sleep and breath soccer," Hernandez said. "My dad, my uncle and everybody in my family played."  

But it wasn't soccer that brought the Hernandez family to America. His parents were musicians in a band and moved the family to Midland, Michigan when Herenandez was 10, eager to bring their music to a whole new audience.  In the meantime, Hernandez stayed active (to say the least) by singing, painting, writing poetry and playing the piano.  

"My dad is a pianist, but he never really taught me. When he played, I picked it up. I taught myself how to play the guitar and drums.  Music is in the blood," Hernandez said.

A player of four instruments in total, a speaker of three languages and an All-State athlete in two different states, Judah Hernandez has led one extraordinary life. And he's earned every bit of it.

"When I was 12 years old, I wasn't any good," he said.  "My dad took me outside and tied a tire around me - a big semitruck tire. He's like 'run down the street.'  So that's how I got so fast, running with a tire."

His father had many training techniques."And then in the wintertime, he'd get a sled, tie a rope around me and I'd run through the snow, like a foot of snow, really high.  And I got so fast," Hernandez said.

From 2000-2002, Hernandez played on the Youth U.S. National team, competing in Costa Rica, Italy and across the United States.  He also played club soccer in Detroit, winning the Olympic Development Program National Tournament in 2001. Hernandez moved to Orlando in 2003 and graduated from West Orange High School. this past May.  Now at FIU, Hernandez has yet to be phased while juggling college classes with soccer practices.  

"It's nothing new to me.  When I lived in Michigan I would have to travel 2.5 hours to go to practice.  I was in pretty much all honors classes and I had to go from Midland to Detroit, which is a long drive," he said.  

"I had to do homework in the car.  We'd get home at like one or two every morning, get up at six and do it all over again."

With aspirations of playing professionally, Hernandez earned his second start for FIU against Howard on Sept. 10. After three shots were denied by Howard goalie Jason Williams, Hernandez would have been excused for showing a bit of frustration when he came out of the game.  But instead, he touched the grass and smiled, crossing his heart and tilting back his dreadlocks to look skyward.

"God is the biggest part of my life.  Honestly, I don't want to become professional to make a lot of money or get all the girls," he said. 

"I want people to know that He was a good man.  If it's just a little sign of the cross or just the way I act around people, I want them to see that there's a little bit of God in me."

When asked what his goals are for his freshman season, Hernandez puts the team first.

"We'd love to win NCAA finals and honestly, right now, I wouldn't put it past us.  We haven't even meshed fully together and at times we look like Brazil," he joked.

As for himself?

"I would love to make All-American, something like that.  My main goal is to score 15 [goals] for the season.  I don't know how possible it is. Some people laugh. When people laugh I just want to score more," Hernandez said.

This time, the joke is on the rest of Conference USA.

Headline: Bonds' return to baseball comes at perfect timing
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Breathe easy little ones and have no fear.  All is well in baseball land because Barry Bonds is back in the Bay Area.

That's right; the most selfish, egotistical, self-absorbed player the game has ever seen, is sadly reclaiming his fame in an insignificant point of the season.

And who had to suffer to keep Bonds' prestige alive?  Well, Jason Giambi had to get booed in his hometown, Rafael Palmeiro took the role of a two-faced liar and dozens of other major league hopefuls' reputations were tarnished because they didn't get the new shipment of flaxseed oil.

America tends to want to protect its premier athletes.  Nobody heard much about Michael Jordan's off court gambling habits, and society turned a blind eye to Mickey Mantle's struggles with alcohol.

It seems as though time passes by, and steroid rumors pile up, Major League Baseball has less heroes to count on and finds itself trying to promote unworthy candidates.

Bonds is not a modern symbol for baseball.  Of course, nobody is perfect and I'm sure even the Tony Gwynns and Kirby Pucketts of the world did things they weren't very proud of. But they didn't cheat their way through the game and onto the record books.

Like Houdini in chains, Bonds has been able to magically escape the line of fire in the steroids war while standing right in the middle of it.

It's these allegations and lack of evidence that makes you wonder - who else is involved?

I mean come on - everyone knows he did it!  His own trainer has been depicted as a main steroid suppliers.  The only question that comes to mind is how come somebody has yet to prove it?

Somehow, Barry has slithered away from any suspensions or court hearings and has gone about his daily business as the world rotates on his fingertips.

In the mid-90s, after his father was murdered, Michael Jordan retired right after winning three straight championships, while and being at the pinnacle of his career.

He said he wanted to pursue his dream to play baseball - like his father always wanted.

Now that makes for a beautiful story, but only the naïve at heart can fully believe that to be true.

The murder of Jordan's father was actually traced back to Jordan's gambling habits and it was said that he owed money to a mobster, who killed his father in revenge.

True or not, these rumors started escalating and it has been said that in order for Jordan's legacy to remain intact and the focus of the situation to be shifted, he needed to break from the game.  

This recalls a very familiar situation.  

Before this season, Bonds missed a total of 362 games in 19 seasons (that's an average of 19 games a year!).  

Now, all of a sudden, Bonds misses almost an entire season because that darn knee can't seem to heal.

No one is trying to say that he really isn't hurt, but that sore knee has sure had a rough time getting better. 

What we are looking at is a man so proud and absorbed with his image, that he would do anything to keep from damaging it.  

So Barry, since you've been gone so long, let me recap what has taken place. 

Nearly 40 professional baseball players have been suspended for steroid use.  

Rafael Palmeiro now has a minimal chance at the Hall of Fame. 

Sammy Sosa all of a sudden can't hit a homerun.

 Jason Giambi is adapting to a post-steroid life.

 And Ivan Rodriguez looks like a malnourished Holocaust victim.

Now, you can continue on your course of shamelessly putting yourself among the elite ballplayers and tearing every slugging record to pieces with your bloated, water-based muscles.

Bonds is like a mastermind, strategically planning his way out of this steroid maze baseball finds itself in.

For the first time in his life, Bonds has to take on a subtle role and try to creep through the shadows instead of in the center of the spotlight.

Bonds will quietly - as if that were possible - try to muster a few more homeruns to at least pass the Babe in his quest for "immortality." 

He has already planned his return for next season with his recent comments about having to lose weight to "support his knees."

I guess he takes all of us for a bunch of fools. 

No way things could be so perfect - So perfect that the minute he needs to stop using steroids is the minute he needs to lose weight.  

No way the minute his knee is injured is the same minute the steroid-ridden season will start.  

No way the minute he comes back is the same minute baseball is actually fun again.  

Nobody's timing is that good ... is it?

Headline: I LOVE YOU YOUR PERFECT...I WANT A DIVORCE
Subheadline: Stable, older married couples have higher success rate
Author: Christine Borges / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As college students, every month (if not every week) we hear about friends or acquaintances getting married. And usually, those who are fixing to get "hitched" aren't the ones we're expecting; it's not the ones that have been together for a couple of years and it's not our older friends. 

So why are they doing it? 

We are a different generation than that of our parents and grandparents. We live in a fast-paced society where anything goes and patience is a thing of the past. 

A self-sufficient breed, we rely solely on ourselves for monetary gratification (generally speaking) and feel that many things can be easily replaced. So the question we should be asking ourselves before we choose to go down that  aisle is, "Do we really mean forever?"

As part of an age group constantly seeking independence, I find it weird that so many are getting married at such young ages. 

"Being in a relationship is hard enough, add young age to that and it is even tougher. We think love solves every problem, but it doesn't," said senior Jennifer Arce. "There are many aspects of life to worry about. People often say it is about growing together, but when you are in college, you still have a lot of growing up to do." 

And the statistics are against us, too. According to David Popenoe, Ph.D., former social and behavioral sciences dean at Rutgers University and co-director of "The Marriage Project," studies show that young marriages, especially in teen years, have an especially high rate of divorce. 

"Once you get to the mid-20s, those youthful concerns cancel out [but] the downside is that you get used to living as an independent single person - and increasingly as a single person in a live-in sexual partnership with someone. When marriage finally comes in the 30s, it's a big shift, and that's difficult for people," Popensoe said.

Oddly enough, though, the statistics for divorce aren't high for people who get married when they are financially and emotionally stable and 30 years old or older. 

The common "50 percent of people who marry will end up getting divorced" statistic is simply a misread figure. 

As per the National Center for Health Statistics in 2005 (from February 2004 - February 2005) there were 7.4 million marriages and 3.7 million divorces - exactly half. 

What people fail to realize when reading this statistic, however, is that of those 3.7 million couples one got divorced, hardly any of them were married during 2004-2005 (the majority who were married in that year and got divorced, however, were under 26 years old). The statistic failed to take any of this into account. 

These 3.7 million couples include people that have been married for many years prior, and annulled marriages as well. 

"So in reality, only about 11-12 percent of people who have ever been married have ever been divorced," said veteran pollster for the National Center for Health Statistics, Louis Harris. 

By his calculations, about 90 percent of mature American marriages actually survive. So what about the rest of us? It seems we are the ones getting divorced within the first few years of marriage, so why do we continue to get married so young? 

"Honestly, I believe that if it is true love it can wait until both persons are financially and emotionally ready to deal with all of the responsibility that comes with being married and living together," said junior Jeff Quintana. 

"I see too many people rushing to get with someone just because they are happy at the moment and are more comfortable with the person they are with at that point in time then they have ever been with anyone else. Comfort is not love."

If we treated marriages like lifetime jobs instead of "comfortable love" and we work at them every day, maybe we'd get different results.  If marriage pays you with enormous amounts of love, would you leave it? Maybe. But if a job pays you well and you are beyond comfortable, would you leave that? Odds are, you wouldn't. 

So next time you're thinking about going down the aisle, think about everything that it encompasses: Financial and emotional stability and lifetime commitment, for instance. Just because divorce exists, doesn't mean it should be an option. 

Rather than going into a commitment thinking, "Hey, I can replace them if I'm not happy" outlook people should go into marriage with the realization that they are committing themselves for life, not just for right now.

Maybe if we stopped treating relationships like disposable objects, and worried less about showing the world our (not so committed) commitment, and more about showing it to each other, we might hear about more people staying together till death do us part.

Headline: Fair promotes student involvement
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Freshman Alejandro Gutierrez, like most other first year students at FIU, has been looking for ways to become more active within the university since the semester began.

"When I was in high school, my parents wanted me to join a fraternity, but that type of involvement never really appealed to me," said Gutierrez, who is majoring in psychology.

For students who may have similar feelings, the Student Organizations Council will hold its annual Club Fair from Sept. 26 - 29. Every year, a different theme is decided for the event. For this year, a casino theme has been chosen.

The fair is a good opportunity for those who are still skeptical of school involvement to get a good idea of the kinds of clubs to join. 

Entertainment, including music, free henna tattoos and a magician will be on hand in the Graham Center Pit and at the Betty Chapman Plaza throughout the week.

On each day, the fair will begin at 11:00 a.m. and end at 2:00 p.m.

Each club that takes part in the fair will have a chance to win prizes during the table decoration contest. 

A different table will be picked each day and the prize is $25, which will go to the winning club. 

In order to win, club members must be in casino attire and their tables must be decorated in casino colors; the colors chosen are white, red, green, black and purple.

A specified day has been appointed to particular types of clubs. 

On Sept. 26, all religious, spiritual, service and sports clubs will be displaying their demonstrations. 

All academic, business and engineering clubs have been allotted time throughout the afternoon of Sept. 27 to showcase their clubs. 

All arts, social and cultural clubs will follow the next day, Sept. 28, and finally, all health, wellness, law and political clubs will wrap up the week on Sept. 29.

Although the events will be spread throughout the entire week, Gutierrez plans on visiting  as many stands as he can until he finds a club that appeals to him.

"I think that by attending the Club Fair I will find a club that meets my needs," Gutierrez said.

Headline: Faculty convocation brings week-long events
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
Faculty Convocation Week will take place Sept. 26 - 30 in order to give FIU faculty and staff recognition for outstanding devotion to the university.

James Sutton, chair for the faculty convocation committee, believes this year's event will rival those of previous years.

"What sets this year's convocation exercises apart from past years is that we have two local speakers addressing FIU faculty, staff and students, on matters that have daily relevance to the work we do here every day," Sutton said. 

On Sept 26, The Honors College will hold its fifth annual Honors College Convocation. This event will set spark to the Faculty Convocation Week. The convocation will consist of two parts, the first being The Parade of Nations and States, in which the FIU Marching Band will display different flags from where all Honors College students and faculty are from. Starting in the Graham Center piano lounge and ending in GC Ballrooms, the parade will march through a large portion of the University Park campus. The latter segment will be a reception in the  GC Ballrooms, where food, drinks and music will be provided.

This same night, University President Modesto Maidique will host the Tenure and Promotion Reception at the University House, in which all faculty members who have received tenure or a promotion during the previous year are invited. This specific event is closed to the public but is still a part of the weekly celebrations.

On Sept. 27, Miami-Dade County Public Schools' Superintendent Rudy Crew will deliver a speech on the University and the community, the week's theme. Although the speech is open to anyone interested, all education majors are strongly encouraged to attend. Crew will begin his speech promptly at 4 p.m. at the Biscayne Bay Campus's Wolfe University Center.

"Mr. Crew has extensive experience in university-community partnerships and he is very articulate about the role of the university in urban areas," said Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president.

On Sept. 28, a folk music concert will take place at the GC Ballrooms at 8 p.m. History professor and convocation committee member Howard Rock is proud of the talent planned for the concert.

"We have been having folk concerts for five years now, and the last three years we have brought in some of the best talent in the nation," Rock said.

This years talent includes New York-born vocalist Priscilla Herdman. Herdman has been performing since 1977 and recently released her twelfth album titled "The Road Home".

On Sept. 29, Rosenberg will host a dinner at the GC Faculty Club in order to honor the Faculty Senate. Rosenberg will give a speech titled "The Vision Within The Vision: Making the Whole Greater and the Sum of its Parts". 

"The focus of my speech will be on the need to build linkages with municipalities in our community," Rosenberg said. 

The Award and Convocation Awards Ceremony will conclude the celebrations on Sept. 30. The ceremony will be held at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center and will honor 31 faculty members. Some of the awards given will include recognition in teaching, advising, research, service and graduate mentoring. During the ceremony, Lisa Delpit, executive director for the eminent scholar center for urban education and innovation, will give a speech on key issues involving the university and the community.

Following the ceremony, a ticketed luncheon will be held, in which a panel discussion with three local mayors will take place. The three local mayors invited are Manny Moreno of Sweetwater, Kevin North of North Miami and Roscoe Warren of Homestead. The discussion will be chaired by executive dean of the College of Urban and Public Affairs Ron Berkman. Commentary will be provided by Dario Moreno, political science professor and Valerie Patterson, assistant professor in the College of Heath and Urban Affairs. 225 seats are available for the luncheon, which is free of charge but will require a ticket for entrance.

Junior Nadia Ramirez is glad to see faculty receive recognition for their efforts.

"I always see award ceremonies given for students, but I never see any for professors. Without a strong faculty, FIU and its students are nothing," Ramirez said.

Headline: University unites for Katrina relief efforts
Author: Jackie Diaz / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For students at FIU, lending a hand to help hurricane Katrina victims could be easier than imagined. As soon as images of Hurricane Katrina's destruction appeared on news channels across the nation, FIU began working to help the victims. 

FIU has adopted the University of New Orleans, one of FIU's sister schools in the Sun Belt Conference. The Office of Admissions has already taken in nearly 200 students from the Mississippi area.

During the upcoming weeks, there will be several events taking place at the University Park campus and Biscayne Bay Campus that will allow students to take part in the cause. 

BBC will be holding a pep rally in the Wolfe University Center's Panther Square, Sept. 29 at 11 a.m. where donations will be collected until Sept. 30 at 3:30 p.m. All donations will be accepted including: Canned food, nonperishable food, bottled water, baby supplies, first-aid kits, over-the-counter medications and other practical items.

"There will be an ongoing collection of money and relief supplies," said Brian Haynes, assistant vice president of Student Affairs.

Insomnia 2005, an all-night concert set up by student organizations from both campuses, will take place immediately following FIU's first home football game of the season.

The Golden Panthers will play against the Rattlers of Florida A&M, at 9 p.m. at the Orange Bowl Oct. 1. According to Vanessa Robinson, the director of Panther Power, it is not yet determined what band will perform at the concert. 

Volunteers will be stationed throughout the  crowd to collect monetary donations. During the  pre-game,  there will also be student volunteers throughout the stadium collecting supplies.

"Students have responded tremendously," said Mark Riordan, director of media relations at the Media Relations Office. "After e-mailing the Katrina relief efforts memorandum, we received about 200 requests to volunteer." 

All donations collected at BBC Sept. 29 and 30 will be combined with the game donations and shipped to New Orleans. 

"We are not just affected within the Sun Belt Conference, Katrina is affecting everyone nationally," Robinson said.

Panther Power and Student Programming Council will hold an additional donation drive on Oct. 20 from 6 a.m. to 10  a.m. at the Wolfe University Center's Panther Square. This way, students who are unavailable Oct. 1 have another chance to donate. 

Right after the drive, the Homecoming Pajama Jam Glow Party will begin from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the WUC Ballroom, where the university will continue to collect donations.

"I think it's great that FIU is working as hard as it is to help students at UNO," said Juliana Zerbino, a senior majoring in international business and management. 

The chemistry and biology department at BBC is also collecting items in the science lab.

"We have almost filled up the whole lab, we now need to classify the items," said Myra Exposito, a senior lab teaching specialist. 

Students who want to volunteer to classify these items can report to room 340 in Academic II. 

Community Blood Center of South Florida, Inc. has visited both campuses since Katrina hit to collect blood donations. 

"The fact that we may get some Katrina victims transported to our hospitals emphasizes the need to keep our blood supply high," said Brenda Rohena, blood center representative at Community Blood Center, who walked around the UP campus to recruit donors. 

Although FIU's main focus is in the relief efforts for UNO, residents of Mississippi will also be taken into consideration. For this reason students are urged to donate. 

Once a month, Community Blood Centers of South Florida will visit UP between the bookstore and the Gold Parking Garage. They are also scheduled to visit BBC at the bus loop between the library and Academic I. 

In addition to the events taking place in the upcoming month, drop boxes are located in both campuses for donations. UP will have its central collection site in the GC Atrium; the BBC site is in the Wolfe University Center at the information desk. Monetary donations are accepted at UP in PC 515M. 

"We want to join hands with the FIU community to help make a stronger impact," said Sabrina Mendez president of SPC.

Headline: Fine arts graduate students host literary session series
Author: Begone Cazalis / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Community Collaborations, is a series of literary events planned by Laura McDermott, an FIU graduate student in the fine arts program, which consists of open mic sessions where students are allowed to read their own work, listen and get to know other writers.

The first of these events took place Sept. 13 at the Luna Star Café located in North Miami between Northeast 7th Avenue and 125th Street.

 The event's main purpose was to bring together FIU and University of Miami students who are continuously influencing Miami's literary scene, but are often isolated from one another.    

 "I think of these two schools like a sleep camp in which you have the boys on one side and the girls on the other, but none of them are able to see what is going on either side," McDermott said.

 As a student in the program for the past two years, McDermott took the initiative of organizing this event in an effort to join the local literary community.

 "Miami is very spread out, so I am hoping that something like this will unite the writers in this area," McDermott said.

At the event, 20 students were able to read their work for an hour. Denise Duhamel, a creative writing professor at FIU and Maureen Seaton, a creative writing professor at the University of Miami, introduced these students. Both professors recited a piece from "Exquisite Politics", a book of poems they  co-wrote.

The place chosen for the readings, The Luna Star Café is located near the Biscayne Bay Campus but it was a small place for the large number of people who attended. Many attendees viewed the performances standing up, but it was a relaxed atmosphere, where the audience was able to enjoy dinner and refreshments while listening to poetry.

"I thought the Luna Star was a wonderful place for the reading. It's close to school, and it is a local business that obviously cares about literature and writers," said Kevin Allen, an English professor at BBC. "I liked the reading very much. I knew many of the writers from FIU, and think they are all talented and interesting."

Although there were no requirements for students who wanted to read their work, most of the writers who participated were graduate students from the MFA program.

John Comacho, a poet and musician who graduated from FIU's MFA program, was excited to read his work to this audience.

"I think is great there are so many people. The more that are here that are readers and appreciators of poetry and fiction the better. People that enjoy it and really are touched by the words," he said.

Some of the themes presented were love, hot summers, menopause and sexuality. However, upcoming events will take place the second Thursday of every month and will have different specific themes, according to McDermott.

"I think writers and poets in particular need a supportive writing community. I was stuck by the warm, supportive and engaging environment of that night," said Jill Drumm, executive editor of Gulf Stream magazine, which is issued by FIU's creative writing program. "The Luna Star reading series fills a much needed gap in the literary community here."  

 Together, Drumm and McDermott will be working to continue the Hurricane Katrina fundraising efforts which started during the past event. Event coordinators were able to raise $420 selling books donated by several of the writers who were present.

 According to Drumm in the next event, Gulf Stream will donate issues and subscriptions for a raffle that they hope will also help raise money for hurricane relief.

 "I am looking for people that are looking for exposure, whether they are undergrads, [have] never studied poetry or published a million books, it doesn't matter. Everybody has a talent and hopefully we'll find a way to get themes to work everybody in and help them grow as we grow." McDermott said.

Headline: "Flightplan" goes awry with forgettable, weak plot
Author: Geoffre Anderson / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Jodie Foster plays an emotionally distraught widow in "Flightplan," a thriller that builds up viewer's emotions in the first hour and completely lets them down in the final scenes because of outlandish plot twists.

The movie begins with Kyle Pratt (Foster) sitting on a subway bench. 

The subsequent scenes are interwoven with flashbacks of Pratt's deceased husband, who suffered an untimely death from a fall.

A week after her husband's death, Pratt and her 6-year-old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston) travel from Berlin, Germany to New York City on a cutting-edge jumbo jet to transport the husband's body for burial. 

Three hours into the flight, Pratt awakens from her sleep and discovers that her daughter is missing. She asks the other passengers about her daughter, to no avail - none of them have seen her.

Pratt goes to various extremes to find her daughter - she argues with several flight attendants and draws the attention and scorn of the other passengers on the plane. Foster is somehow able to effectively play the role of an emotionally-driven mother, her cries for help seem so natural and chilling.

Her antics on the flight lead to the introduction of several notable characters. 

Air Marshall Carson (Peter Sarsgaard) is put in charge of controlling Pratt's emotional outbursts by Captain Rich (Sean Bean).

While Bean fits his role well and delivers an exceptional performance, Sarsgaard seems to lack any enthusiasm whatsoever. At times, his actions seem lethargic and forced. 

Furthermore, both of their characters suffer from weak scripting that never fully develops them.

The movie also introduces garden-variety plane passengers: the first-time flyer, the family with annoying kids and the high-maintenance flyer. Although these characters do little to progress the plot, they do provide some comic relief during the intense flight.

The seemingly simple plot engrosses the viewer's attention during the first hour. Foster's acting keeps the movie afloat as she is determined to search the entire plane for her daughter's whereabouts.

Unfortunately, the movie throws in some plot twists at the end that simply do not work well. 

There is no convincing motivation behind some of the characters' actions and the movie is riddled with glaring plot holes - nobody on a 400+ capacity jet seems to have noticed anything unusual.

Despite its shortcomings, the film does several things right.

The camera direction is especially well done. The camera moves smoothly throughout the plane's aisles and various compartments, showcasing the incredible set design. The camera shots accentuate the increasing tension throughout the plane and clearly highlight the passengers' feelings and expressions.

The two-floor state-of-the-art plane is a beauty to behold: the plane is equipped with the latest technology. Video screens appear everywhere and the first-class lounge is absolutely gorgeous. The many compartments of the plane allow for Foster and her fellow actors to move around freely and strategize their use of the jet.

In addition to great camera -work and set design, the musical score helps set the tone of the movie. The orchestration goes along seamlessly with the acts, climaxing with Foster's more emotional scenes. Also, silence is used effectively as a set-up for some of the movie's thrills.

Despite talented acting and exceptional camera-work and score, the movie's biggest flaw, its plot, cannot be redeemed. The clever set-up is ruined by the unrealistic twists and turns that the script takes in the final acts of the film. 

Overall, the movie is forgettable. Although "Flightplan" is a fun ride, its weak plot takes the movie off course to ultimately run out of fuel.

Headline: The Redwalls bring back a not so new sensation
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For those of us who look back on the 60s and 70s as music's golden era, from which modern musicians could learn a lesson or two, we're not alone. 

From 70s suits to long, unkempt hair, to fake British accents, four Chicago guys called The Redwalls have taken it upon themselves to emulate, as closely as possible, the legends of rock 'n' roll and they've done it delightfully. Lead vocalist and guitarist Logan Baren, his brother and bassist Justin Baren, guitarist Andrew Langer and drummer Ben Greeno, all between the ages of 20 and 22, have just followed up their debut Universal Blues with their sophomore release De Nova.

Upon hearing the opening song "Robinson Crusoe," my first thoughts were that it is extremely reminiscent of John Lennon's vocals, especially in the verses of the 1969 hit "Come Together." Although De Nova has its undeniable Bob Dylan moments, minus the harmonica, reminders of The Beatles in one form or another are woven throughout its tracks. 

The piano and chorus in one of the most enjoyable songs, "Build a Bridge," seem so related to "Hey Jude" that the ad-libs from that classic fit into it perfectly well. In "Back Together," the Redwalls even give a nod of acknowledgement to the lyrics of "All You Need is Love" when they sing, "There's nothing you can do that isn't in your mind." 

The final song, "Rock 'n' Roll," essentially makes the listener want to get up and "Twist and Shout." 

It's unfair to compare the Redwalls song by song to The Beatles, but they seem to be asking us to do just that.

Although I wonder why they repeat two tracks from their previous work, The Redwalls seem to have moved on in the sense that they've added a horn section, perhaps thrown in a little more Dylan influences, and offered more of the straight-up rock 'n' roll not as abundant in Universal Blues.

Few of the songs on De Nova stand out lyrically, with frequent cliches such as "I love her, yes I do/ I love her, and it's true," in "Love Her." Logan even seems admittedly at a loss for words in "Build a Bridge" when he sings, "What can I say?"

"Front Page" and "How the Story Goes" display more signs of creativity in this aspect, as does "Glory of War," which at least seeks to convey a message against senseless bloodshed. Thankfully, the Redwalls's rhythms more than make up for lyrical weakness, and after all, one can't forget that even The Beatles had such lyrical disasters as "Love Me, Do."

The parental advisory label on De Nova, though disappointing in any band, need not go without an explanation. 

Since all other tracks are free from objectionable material, it should be noted that the profanity in "Falling Down" was included as a defiant statement against the censorship of the Federal Communications Commission.

It is ironic that this protest song should be the very one that has caused an explicit material label to be stuck on every copy of De Nova.

To tie it all together, although Mark Hogan on Pitchforkmedia.com accuses The Redwalls of "recycled melodies" and producing "forgettable" works, Relevant magazine reminds us that "reviving rock's heyday surely isn't a bad thing." 

Although lyrically they seem stuck in The Beatles's early years, before their hair grew out and their writing matured, their music and vocals show a glimpse of the talent in The Beatles's later work, making for an engaging album from start to finish.

Subheadline: Controversies about pulling exercises: Learn the correct executions
Author: Edwin Ryan / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Pulling exercises done in the gym include the lat pull down and seated row (high and low). Many variations exist for these exercises and people are attracted to them for their aesthetic appeal. However, if continuously performed incorrectly, one may eventually develop a wide mid to low back, but at the cost of a painful and dysfunctional shoulder. The purpose of this article is to present a basic understanding of shoulder joint movements during pulling exercises and suggest training tips that would greatly reduce the risk of shoulder injury and dysfunction.

The major muscles involved in performing a pulling exercise include: The large muscle that projects from under the arm and gives the appearance of having wings (latissimus dorsi), the muscles located between the shoulder blades that serve as very important postural muscles (middle trapezius and rhomboids), the bulky muscle on the upper part of the arm (rear deltoid) and the bicep, which is located on the front part of the upper arm below the anterior deltoid. 

These muscles all work collectively during all pulling or rowing exercises. However, the primary focus of pulling exercises is to work the middle trapezius and rhomboids, rear deltoid and latissimus dorsi.

In order to understand the basic analysis of an exercise one must also have an understanding of the way these muscles work and their joint actions. A joint action refers to the movement that occurs at a joint(s). Knowing what joint actions are being performed helps to know which muscle is being stressed.

 During high pulling exercises (high rows), in which the upper arm is positioned between 65 to 80 degrees from the side of the body, the primary joint action when the muscles are shortening is shoulder horizontal extension (since the upper arms are almost horizontal in relation to the floor, and it passes the torso). The major muscles worked in high row are the middle trapezius and rhomboids, rear deltoid, latissimus dorsi and biceps. The high row is important because the higher arm position places more emphasis on the postural muscles located between the shoulder blades (middle trapezius and rhomboids). During low pulling exercises (low rows), in which the upper arm is positioned close to the side of the body up to about 55 degrees away from the side, the primary joint action is shoulder joint extension (since the upper arms are closer to the body and the upper arm passes the torso). The major muscles worked in low rowing exercises are the latissimus dorsi, rear deltoid, biceps, middle trapezius and rhomboids.

 The low row places greater emphasis on the latissimus dorsi due to the lower arm angle. Therefore, once the weight is being pulled from the front of the body, a low or high rowing exercise can be performed.

Low and high rowing with the arms in front of the body are not the only pulling exercises seen in the gym. Another popular exercise we often see is the lat pull-down. The joint action in which the muscle shortens and brings the upper arm close to the sides is called shoulder adduction.

There are many myths and misconceptions regarding pulling exercises that result in poor form, which leads to injury of the spine and shoulders. One common myth is that when performing the lat pull down, it is best to pull behind the head. The anterior capsule of the shoulder joint is made of ligaments and connective tissue, which are designed to allow only optimal motion in the shoulder joint. 

When the neck lat pull down is performing if one should position your body such that the cable hangs down directly above the base of the neck behind the neck (about where a neck chain would run behind your neck). If not, the action will eventually go pass an optimal safe range under a significant load placing too much stress on the shoulder and neck. Conversely, when the bar is positioned so that the cable hangs down in front of the nose (when sitting in an up right posture) you are far less likely to force the shoulder joint into a potentially damaging position.

Another problem with performing behind the neck lat pull down is poor form. One should avoid bending from the trunk and protruding one's head as the load is pulled towards the chest. This can encourage a forward head posture and potentially place excessive strain on the shoulder joint as well as the soft tissues of the neck. If the forearms are not kept in a vertical position, this could lead to additional strain of other shoulder muscles. The bar should only be pulled to the point that it goes just below the chin. Pulling as far as the nipple line can result in the forearms reaching horizontally which encourages trunk bending and a forward head. This can lead to shoulder and spinal injury. Additionally, from a functional stand point, the behind the neck lat pull may not be a very practical activity since there aren't many work or sport activities that require you to pull a load behind your head.

Other problems with both the lat pull down and high/low rowing exercises is to fully squeeze the shoulder blades together before pulling with the high/low rows (shoulder blade retraction), and to fully pull the shoulder blades down (shoulder blade depression) during the lat pull down. However, this can result in faulty training of these muscles, which would lead to premature fatigue possibly affecting the entire shoulder mechanics. 

When this exercise is performed correctly, the shoulder blades move downward together in correct rhythm with the elbows. There is a natural rhythm between the shoulder and shoulder blade called the scapula humeral rhythm. This is a natural physiological action that allows for a 2:1 ratio of movement of the shoulder joint to the shoulder blade (scapula). That is, for every two degrees of shoulder joint motion, there should be a natural one degree of shoulder blade motion. 

Therefore, performing behind the neck lat pulls and high rowing actions with premature movements of the shoulder blade is non-physiological and can lead to imbalances and injury in the shoulder joint. The exercise should be performed with a simultaneous movement of the upper arms and shoulder blades. This follows the natural scapular shoulder joint rhythm.

One other common mistake often seen with low rowing exercises is to round the back as the load is going forward. This has two major areas of concern. First, as you bend forward in a seated position with your feet up, the motion in your hip is restricted which encourages further bending from the upper and lower spine. 

This is done under significant load and places a great deal of stress on structures within the spine. Second, coming up from this bent position requires involvement of other back muscles as main movers and not the latissimus dorsi as intended. The correct way to perform this exercise is to maintain an erect posture with your abdominals tight, and the spine held in a natural position.

It must be emphasized how important it is to perform high rowing exercises as this works the very important postural muscles mentioned above (middle trapezius and rhomboids). 

As you perform your high/low rowing or other types of lat pull down exercises, please keep in mind that exercise should be progressive and that you should always use a weight load that you can effectively control for the entire set. As you become stronger, heavier loads can be lifted. However, one should never trade good form, safety and stability for increased mobility.

&nbsp;
HOME FINANCING CENTER - A UNIVERSITY CREDIT UNION AFFILIATE- ARE THIEVES!!!!!

ARRIVED AT HOME FINANCING OFFICE IN MIAMI AT 8:30 IN THE MORNING THE DAY BEFORE CLOSING BECAUSE I FELT CONCERN AT HOME FINANCING CENTER COMPETENCY TO MEET CLOSING SCHEDULE.

THESE CONCERNS ARE DUE TO:

1) REDUNDANT INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT FIND WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED TO THEM FROM MYSELF, THE TITLE COMPANY, AND THE BUILDERS. 

2) PHONE CALLS FROM THE BUILDER AND TITLE COMPANY REQUESTING I CONTACT HOME FINANCING BECAUSE THEIR CALLS WERE NOT BEING RETURNED

3) HOME FINANCING CENTER ASKING ME TO DO THEIR JOB AND FIND OUT INFORMATION FROM THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND TITLE COMPANY .

4) THE LACK OF INCLUDING ACTUAL FIGURES FROM THE TITLE COMPANY WHO SENT THEM TO HOME FINANCING ONE AND A HALF WEEKS PRIOR TO CLOSING. 

ROSARIO, FROM HOME FINANCING CENTER, WAS SUPPOSEDLY, WORKING ON MY FILE SO I STUCK TO HER ALL DAY PRIOR TO CLOSING WAITING FOR DOCUMENTATION FOR CLOSING. I SAT IN HER OFFICES WATCHING HER MAKE THE APPEARANCE TO BE WORKING HARD TO GET THINGS DONE - THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED SEVERAL DAYS AGO. SHE PLACED BLAME ON FANNIE MAE, WHO HAD NOT GIVEN APPROVAL FOR THE BUILDING PROJECT,  AND ON VIVIAN, WHO WAS WORKING ON MY CLOSING FIGURES.
In An Effort To Wait For Vivian The "Closer" To Give Me Final Figures And Waiting For Mari, The "Manager", To Get Fannie Mae Project Approval, Rosario Showed Me Actual Fannie Mae Documentation And Highlighted The Rates That I Was Categorized Under By Fannie Mae That. She Explained How I Could Pay Down The Interest By Adding More Money At Closing. The Morning Was Spent Doing The Math To See Which Rate Would Pay Off The Most Over The Few Years I Expect To Live At The Condo. WE EVEN CONSIDERED HOW MY DOWN PAYMENT DEPOSIT COVERS COST OF CLOSING WHICH WAS DISCUSSED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST MONTH.


THE ENTIRE MORNING EVOLVED AROUND LOOKING AT INTEREST RATE AND "WAITING" FOR VIVIAN AND MARI TO PROVIDE INFO FOR CLOSING. 

I WAS INFORMED BY ROSARIO THAT THE RATE COULD NOT BE FINALIZED UNTIL THEY GET WORD FROM FANNIE MAE THAT THE BUILDING PROJECT WAS APPROVED. ROSARIO INFORMED ME THAT BECAUSE FANNIE MAE MIGHT NOT APPROVE THE BUILDING PROJECT SHE MIGHT NEED TO GIVE ME A NON-CONFORMING LOAN (WHICH MEANS ALL THE FIGURES AND RATES WOULD CHANGE).

... AT 5:00PM THEY JUST SO HAPPEN TO FIND MY FILE FROM SOME LADY NAMED "LIZ". IT THEN ONLY TOOK LESS THEN 30 MINUTES FOR VIVIAN TO SEND ROSARIO FINAL FIGURES. 

BUT, THE FIGURES INCLUDED FEES THAT WERE EXORBITANT!!! IT WAS RIDICULOUS. 

SO GIVEN THE ASSURANCE THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF AND WITH LITTLE CONFIDENCE AND WITH RELUCTANCE I RETURNED TO ORLANDO.

THE NEXT DAY (CLOSING DAY) I CALLED HOME FINANCING TO SEE IF ALL WAS TAKEN CARE OF. THEY SAID THEY WERE STILL WAITING FORM FANNIE MAE'S APPROVAL ON THE PROJECT. 

IN THE MEAN TIME I CONTACTED SEVERAL ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS TO OBTAIN PROOF THAT THE FEES HOME FINANCING CENTER WERE CHARGING ME WERE COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE. THEN I CALLED ANOTHER MORTGAGE LENDER, WHO HAS CLOSED ON SEVERAL UNITS IN THE SAME COMMUNITY, TO GET THE "FANNIE MAE PROJECT APPROVAL" FOR MY LENDER. 

TOOK ALL THE INFORMATION I GATHERED IN JUST 30 MINUTES TO GIVE TO MY LENDER WHO COULDN'T FIND THEM WITHIN 30 DAYS. CALLED THE "SO CALLED MANAGER" MARI , VIVIAN AND ROSARIO AND LEFT THEM MESSAGES WITH THE INFORMATION .
JUST SO HAPPEN 30 MINUTES LATER I GET A CALL FROM THE "MANAGER" THAT THEY SOMEHOW FOUND THE APPROVAL THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ONLINE AND CAN NOW FINALIZE MY FILE. 

SEVERAL HOURS LATER AND 30 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING ROSARIO CALLED ME AND SAID THAT THE FEES WERE REDUCED TO SOMETHING REASONABLE BUT MY INTEREST RATE WOULD GO UP 1.5% BECAUSE SHE FORGOT THAT I WAS GETTING 100% FINANCING. !@!@##$@ FORGOT I APPLIED FOR 100% FINANCING 30 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING!! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT !@#q@#. ROSARIO YOU HAVE HAD THIS FILE FOR A YEAR - YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SEVERAL GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES - LAST NIGHT CLOSING INSTRUCTIONS (PRELIMINARY FINAL ESTIMATE) WAS FOR 100% FINANCING - TOLD ROSARIO HER EXCUSE WAS ABSURD - AND REMINDED HER THAT, ACCORDING TO HER COMMENTS,  RATES WOULD CHANGE ONLY IF FANNIE MAE DID NOT APPROVE THE BUILDING PROJECT - AND HOW WE SPENT ALL MORNING THE DAY BEFORE LOOKING AT INTEREST RATES - AND HOW SHE SHOWED ME THE CHART OF INTEREST RATES FROM FANNIE MAE AND HIGHLIGHTED WHAT OPTION WOULD BE THE BEST FOR ME. 

HER RESPONSE AND HER EXCUSE WAS THE SAME SHE USED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, SHE BLAME SOMEONE ELSE - THIS TIME ,VIVIAN - AND SAID SHE WOULD CALL ME BACK WITH UPDATED INFO. 

30 MINUTES PAST CLOSING I GOT A CALL FROM THE TITLE COMPANY AND WAS TOLD TO BRING SOME "NEVER HEARD OF" AMOUNT TO CLOSING. I EXPLAINED TO HER THE SITUATION AND SAID I WILL GO TO THE OFFICE AND SEE IF THINGS WILL GET WORKED OUT THERE.
ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE... WAITED THERE OVER AN HOUR BECAUSE OF HOME FINANCING CENTER LACK OF SENDING THEIR FINAL FIGURES. several other lenders were there at the office with their clients. I spoke to one of the reps and she said she closed several units in that community that day and all went great. several of the personnel at the closing office informed me that they had lenders documentation several days before closing for units in the community I'm buying in. Spoke to the builders and they informed me that, so far, there has not been any flaw in any of the units that have closed in that community - and that their process was rated 10 (10 being the highest satisfactory rate).

Finally, a closing rep informed that we could begin sighing off all the documentations to close the sale of my first home and that the final figures from home financing showed that I would be getting money back from my deposit instead of me paying additional money. 

AT THE CLOSING DESK I WAS GIVEN NEW DOCUMENTATION THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE FROM MY LENDER FOR "CLOSING". THE DOCUMENTS INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN MY INTREST RATE BY 1.5%.
I AM SO MAD, FRUSTRATED AND DISAPPOINTED WITH HOME FINANCING. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN BAMBOOZLED AND THAT THIS ENTIRE TIME I ENTRUSTED MY FIRST HUGE INVESTMENT WITH INCOMPETENT THIEVES. 

ROSARIO, KAREN, VIVIAN, LIZ, AND MARI I DO NOT APPRECIATE WHAT WAS DONE. AND I AM GOING TO NOTIFY AS MANY PEOPLE AND PAPERS AND WHOEVER ELSE WILLING TO LISTEN THAT YOU ARE THIEVES. HOME FINANCING CENTER JUST VERY WELL MAY BE A REPUTABLE COMPANY BUT YOU ALL HAVE MADE MY FIRST TIME BUYING EXPERIENCE A UTTER NIGHTMARE!!!!
