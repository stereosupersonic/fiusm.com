Headline: Softball looking to reach post-season play
Author: Harry Coleman and Andres Cordero / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
After missing out on post-season action last season, head coach Kim Gwydir knew she had to change the team's philosophy. 

With the departure of key players who graduated, Gwydir has put together a team with solid pitching and speed.

With Jennifer Owens graduating, the team lost its most powerful bat of last season. By losing power, Gwydir changed the team's offense to be built on speed.

"I'm very excited. We have really changed the make up of our team," said Gwydir. "We are built on speed, so we will do a lot of hitting and running."

The Golden Panthers return six starters from the 2004 campaign. Among them is two-time, first-team All-Sun Belt selection, pitcher Amanda Nealer. The senior slinger holds the school record for career strikeouts (421) and needs just three wins to become the winningest pitcher in FIU history.

By season's end, Gwydir knows that Nealer will go down as an FIU legend.

"She will go down in the record books as the best pitcher in FIU history," Gwydir said. "She will have every pitching record by the time she graduates."

The main goal for the team is to win the conference.

"The goal is to win the conference and get the ring," said Nealer. "We need to win while having fun. If we don't enjoy each other, then we won't be successful."

Power hitters for this year's team include senior Marleah Stapf and junior Jennifer Powell. Both will alternate at the catcher and designated player positions. Lindsey Tippings and Tabitha Embry will return to second base and shortstop, respectively. The sophomore and senior started all 64 games last season for the Golden Panthers.

Freshman Ashley Falk will handle the first base duties, and she expects to contribute right away. Another freshman who will see playing time is Brook Ruiz who will most likely start at third and serve as a back-up at first base.

  Sophomores Deomni Murray and Brittany Witherow return at center field and right field, respectively, after injury-riddled freshman campaigns.  Junior college transfer student, Cassie Parker, from Polk Community College will round up the outfield by starting in left field.

Newcomers Kerri Houck, a Western High School graduate, and Sarah Belanger, a Team Canada veteran, expect to see action on the mound for the Golden Panthers. Houck comes with high expectations after she became the first Class 6A pitcher to accumulate 1,000 career strikeouts in Florida high school history. 

"Her high school record speaks for itself, and she will be awesome for us," Gwydir said.

Belanger is already one of the hardest throwers in FIU history and should see plenty of action on the field.

"Sarah is the hardest thrower we have ever had here at FIU," Gwydir said. "She has worked very hard on her variety of pitches this fall, adding a change-up and a curve ball to her repertoire, and this is only going to make her that much more difficult for opposing hitters to deal with."

This spring training practice routines have also been different for the team.

The team has spent more time facing live pitching rather than hitting off the tee ball or Gwydir.

"We're doing a lot more hitting and live pitching. That's important because hitting off live pitching is realistic," Nealer said. "I also think that we are 10 times better than last year."

Subheadline: FIU Baseball: A look at the upcoming season
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a disappointing year last season, the Golden Panther baseball team is looking to turn things around. 

The team has a lot of incentive to do better after finishing last season with a 29-33 record, the worst in the program's history. 

The team, returning five of eight everyday starters, hopes to improve in many ways.  	"Hopefully we got more depth [through recruiting]," said coach Danny Pryce, referring to one of last season's weaknesses. 

"This team has a real chance of winning the conference this year," said shortstop Luis Rivera, one of the five returning starters. 

If the Golden Panthers want to accomplish that, they must improve last year's 12-12 Sun Belt Conference record. 

Here is a position-by-position review of the 2005 FIU Golden Panther baseball team:

OUTFIELD

The outfield is probably the position with the most depth and should provide the most offensive production. Junior Yahmed Yema led the team in batting average last year with a .343 average, tied for the team lead in homeruns with nine and had 30 runs batted in. 

Senior Jeff Skellenger ranked right behind the left-handed Yema with almost identical numbers (.342 AVG, 9 HR, 30 RBI). 

Freshman James McOwen, a highly-touted high school player, batted .493 his senior year at St. Thomas Aquinas. His high batting average potential should compliment well with Yema and Skellenger. 

Junior college transfer Randy Youtsey should also see some playing time. Having led his team in triples and stolen bases last year means he has the speed to go along with a credible hitting ability - posting a .390 average a year ago. 

Red-shirt sophomore Chris Dunn, who was a teammate of Youtsey at Central Arizona Community College, should also provide some speed off the bench with his 6.3/60 speed (from home plate to first base). 

Dunn was second to Youtsey on that Central Arizona team in steals and triples. 

Junior Bryan Pullin played five games last season before getting injured and eventually red shirted. Pullin is slated as the designated hitter for the season. In the five games he played last year, he hit .353 with two HR in 17 at bats.

INFIELD

The infield, defensively, is the weakest link on the team. Starters Mike Lopez and Luis Rivera combined for 22 errors last season, but another season under their belts should help them progress. 

Lopez, the first baseman, led the team with 42 RBIs last season and was second in homeruns with eight. The lefty also batted .307 and led the team with a .444 on base percentage - meaning he did not produce an out 44.4 percent of the time he went up to bat. 

Rivera, the shortstop, batted .268 last year with 24 RBIs and just one homerun. Despite having seemingly average numbers, his importance to the team is unprecedented because of the experience he brings on the defensive side.

 "[Rivera is] the middle of our defense, and if we could get him going, that could jump-start the other guys in our lineup,"  Pryce said.

Miami-Dade transfer Yosvel Barroso brings experience to both second and third base. The switch-hitting Barroso should also contribute offensively after hitting .355 last year.

Junior Nick Cadena, another transfer, should see some playing time at third base. Last year, at Arizona State, Cadena hit .260 with three HR and four doubles. 

Junior Dennis Diaz is an exceptional base runner. Last season, his 49 stolen bases led the Sun Belt Conference and were second in the country. He also batted .266 with eight HR, 33 RBI and led the team with 54 runs scored. 

Freshman Corey Lozano should see some time coming off the bench. Last spring, the switch-hitter was regarded as the 69th best prep middle infielder in the nation by Baseball America.

 Lozano brings a good combination of offense, defense and speed. Last year, he batted .442 with 25 RBIs, 16 stolen bases, 36 runs scored, and committed only three errors in 108 chances. 

Freshman Michael Jordan should also contribute off the bench. As a senior at Braddock Senior High, he batted .410 with three home runs and 20 RBIs.

CATCHERS

The catcher position should improve having sophomore Cody Jacobs behind the plate for his second year as a starter. He should improve on the respectable numbers he put up last year, .268 batting average, five homeruns, and 26 RBIs. 

Backup Danny Marquez should see some playing time as well. The freshman is yet another to bring heavy hitting to the team. As a senior at Belen Jesuit, he batted .470 with a team-leading five homeruns and 33 RBIs.

PITCHERS

Having struggled a bit last year, the pitching staff showed vast improvement during the fall league.

"The pitching staff is not as deep as last year, but we're stronger individually," said senior David Asher. 

Asher leads the starting rotation. His numbers last season were not too impressive but should improve this season.

"He's our number one starter. He needs to be a solid force in order for us to be good," coach Pryce said. 

He was second on the team 81.1 innings pitched and his 4.43 earned run average was the lowest amongst FIU starting pitchers. He made 13 consecutive starts and posted a 3-5 record. 

"I've never had a good year in my college career [regarding team performance], so hopefully we can win the [Sun Belt Conference] and move on [to the College World Series]," Asher said.

Freshman Elih Villanueva is set to contribute immediately with the number two spot on the starting rotation. As a senior at Westminster Academy, he posted a 10-3 record with 109 strikeouts to go with a 1.15 ERA

Senior Danny Hernandez led the team with 27 appearances out of the bullpen and seven saves last season. He posted a 2.80 ERA and tied the team-lead with six wins, earning him First Team All-Sun Belt Conference recognition. Hernandez should see time in the closer role again.

Senior Leo Calderon led the staff with a 2.12 ERA and had the second-most appearances on the team with 20. He should see more time coming out of the bullpen after allowing only seven earned runs last season.

Junior Frank Gonzalez allowed just 20 hits (with two extra-base hits) in 19.2 innings of work. Gonzalez's 2.75 ERA was second on the team. He showed vast improvement last season after finishing 2003 with an atrocious 11.75 ERA. Gonzalez will probably come out of the bullpen again. 

Junior Ammer Cabrera is in his third year on the team after red-shirting in 2002. 

The pitching staff also has four lefties varying in experience. Senior Denny Hernandez and junior Jon Banke have a good possibility of making the starting rotation. Transfer student Chris Siebenaler, from Polk Community College, and freshman Les Rodriguez could see playing time out of the bullpen or in a situational role.

The staff is rounded out by senior and two-sport (football) athlete James Knapp, junior transfer Matt Rainy and freshman Ricardo Humaran.

Headline: Student suspects bookstore deception
Author: James Valle / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Cover-ups and denials are something you'd expect to find on "Law and Order" right? Try the FIU Bookstore. 

In my four years at FIU there have been consistent rumors  among students that the bookstore not only charges astronomically high prices and gives back little money for used books, but they also package used books as new and resell them to unsuspecting students at new book prices. 

I thought the new Spanish book I bought, back in 2003, with highlighting from a previous owner was a rare occasion, and I let it slide. But Stephanie Guzman's Letter to the Editor last week in The Beacon not only startled me, it enraged me. 

In the letter, Guzman said her sister, who previously worked at the bookstore, acknowledged that the company is run by thieves who pay peanuts for used books in good condition. They  repackage them and sell them labeled as new books. 

Guzman's book wasn't searched thoroughly before it was wrapped up again. Her book contained the markings and post-its of its previous owner. When she returned to address the situation, she was given guilty faces and was told "no" when she asked to recover the difference in price.

 There is something much bigger going on here than what meets the eye. At best, a few bookstore employees who want  to maximize profits are guilty of swindling FIU students. At worst, bookstore management  encourages its entire staff to follow this practice with every passable book. I'm no lawyer, but I'm sure if that's the situation there is definitely an attorney out there salivating at the chance to take such a case.

 I have no evidence to accuse the bookstore of anything. It's  hard to imagine that used books are mistakenly wrapped nice and tight with no "used" stamps are displayed on them. 

 This university should seriously consider the experience Guzman had and, if necessary, launch its own investigation into the matter. 

With university tuition increases proposed by Governor Jeb Bush, FIU should assert its support for its students, like it has throughout the years. However, this time around, FIU has been frighteningly silent as student costs have skyrocketed. 

There's not a better opportunity for the university to demonstrate its concern for its students and look into why some used books are being sold as new and why the bookstore won't at least refund a deceived student's money. If the bookstore is guilty of knowingly conning the students, then it should drop Barnes  & Noble and go in another direction. 

I'm sure plenty of book companies would jump at the chance to manage FIU's bookstore.  Maybe they'll charge reasonable prices. The ball is in FIU's court now.

Personally, I stopped using the bookstore long ago. I have purchased my textbooks on Amazon.com for three straight semesters without a flaw and have saved hundreds of dollars in the process. 

If you don't like buying online, go across the street to Booksmart, where they sell books for less and buy back for more. Need a Bluebook? Get one for free at the Student Government Association office on the third floor of the Graham Center at University Park.

It's time for students to make some sort of stand against the bookstore. They have shown a complete lack of respect toward the university's students and until the administration takes a stand on our behalf, we're on our own. 

I guarantee if they watch their profits dwindle, prices will come down, and they'll start making the extra effort to make sure those annoying little "used" stamps are not removed off those darn used books.

Getting Involved

A recent survey of 884 students conducted by Campus Life is just one of the many steps the group is taking to involve students in campus activities. 

Campus Life is also getting students involved by putting up Campus Life event banners in the  Ryder Business Building and residence halls. It is also offering office tours with free pizza and giveaways. 

Students surveyed said they loved to get just about anything given out for free! The survey also showed that 45.5 percent of students attended only one Campus Life event last semester.  

FIU vs. UM

A free bus trip and free tickets to the UM v. FIU game are available to the first 200 students who sign up with Panther RAGE, an organization dedicated to promoting school spirit. This game takes place on Feb. 1. at 7 p.m.  To sign up, students can visit the Panther RAGE table in the Graham Center.  

Panther RAGE will soon receive its T-shirt cannon, which it will use to shoot free t-shirts to audience members at games.

Mr. And Ms. Housing

The residence halls' version of "The Dating Game" will conclude on Feb. 4 in the GC Ballroom at 7 p.m., with the crowning of "Mr. And Ms. Housing." 

Finalists chosen from  individual housing halls will compete against each other for the title.  

Also that night, Malik Wilkes, vice president of the Student Government Association will compete at the Dance Marathon Duo, a dance marathon and  game-like dating event in the GC Ballroom.

Headline: Fraternity Rush Week 2005 attracts new members
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While walking around campus this past week, you might have noticed that everywhere you turned there was a Greek letter.  

This is because it was Fraternity Rush Week 2005. All the fraternities around campus held activities to show pride for their brotherhood and to attract potential new members. 

Fraternities participate in many events on campus including those for well-known charities. One such event is "Dance Marathon," which the  Children's Miracle Fund plans. It raises money for the Miami Children's Hospital.  

Their experience with campus life is vast, from the Student Government Association to the Student Organizations Council. They also have three of their own councils: the Pan Hellenic Council (PHC), the National Pan Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the Interfraternity Council (IFC).

Each fraternity takes the mission to recruit very seriously.  

"New members are the lifeline of the organization," said Junior Brian Swensen, who majors in public administration and is a member of Pi Kappa Phi.  

This is one of the main reasons it is a "dry rush," in other words, none of the pledges are allowed to drink alcohol. According to Pi Kappa Phi members, they would never want someone making this lifetime decision while inebriated.  

Each fraternity also has its own special events during Rush Week. They invite those pledging and those who are not, to come out and support them. They begin planning these outings four weeks in advance to prepare and allocate funds from their budget, normally $1,000-$4,000 dollars. 

 This budget also pays for the hundreds of flyers, t-shirts and buttons one sees around campus. For Delta Lambda Phi, this is particularly exciting.

 "This is the first semester that we have real flyers.Our theme is top secret, and we're making it our number one priority to be visible. We've also been tabling a lot, so people will know who we are," said Gustavo Bolaños, a sophomore majoring in journalism, who also appears on each of the flyers.

While the Spring semester is slow in terms of the amount of people pledging, each fraternity had a decent show of interest.  

 "The Spring semester might be slower, but sometimes it's better because you have guys come into FIU who say, 'Let me wait a semester,'" said Andrew Chin, president of the FIJI fraternity. "They work on their grades and come the second semester knowing what they want. They have direction, which is really good and something we look for."  

During the recruitment process, some fraternities say they pick pledges based on academic performance.

"We look for [leaders] who will make excellent network connections and  people with vision...not necessarily athletes, but academic athletes," said Rabbi Sprung, who works with Alpha Epsilon Phi.

Though they are all comprised of young men from diverse cultures and different ethnicities each fraternity seems to look for the same thing in its pledges.  

"It's a lifestyle; it does not just stop at four years...I hope even in the year 3000 I can look back and know that my fraternity and it's brothers are still around," said Ray Morgan, a senior majoring in psychology and biology, and member of fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu.

As one walks around the stands outside the Graham Center, what Morgan means becomes clear. 

Fraternities come together but each group is different in their own way. 

"If you want to get the full college experience: athletic, academic, leadership experience, friends, scholarship [and] honor's council, this is the only place that gives you all that and more. It is a family," said Greek advisor Karen Katz.

Headline: Research TV to highlight faculty
Author: Ana Sanchez / BBC Editor
&nbsp;
While flipping through channels on Mondays and Wednesday, you may just  find one of your professors on television. 

Working together with graduate students and the Miami-Dade Cable-Tap channel, some FIU professors have begun producing a show entitled the "Impact of Research on Society." 

The documentary, which is produced by professor M.O. Thirunarayanan is run by Miami Dade College's School of Entertainment and Design Technology and airs at 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. 

The documentary was filmed, produced and edited by the Broadcast Video Services at FIU, which is part of University Technology Services.

Thirunarayanan, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies, birthed this idea last summer. Dr. Doug Wartzk, Dean for Graduate Studies, approved the idea and they submitted a request to Cable-Tap. 

So far, there have been eight 28-minute shows, each profiling professors' research projects. 

During the first segment, two professors presented their research, followed by a second segment consisting of graduate students from the lab supporting the research.  

 "The documentary was  aimed at students graduating with bachelor degrees and who are trying to decide whether or not they want a graduates degree," said Thirunarayanan. "This will give them an idea of the kind of research done at FIU by our faculty and what they can expect to be doing." 

Not only the program geared toward students but the professors hope to the documentary is watched by the public - people interested in technological advances. The research done in the documentary may be useful for public health, diet, and environmental concerns. 

"We are highlighting practical applications of research which can be beneficial to the public on a personal level," Thirunarayanan said. "This project is [meant] to inform the public that the FIU faculty is doing good research." 

Dr. Janvier Gasana from the Department of Public Health, presented research concerning lead poisoning on the show. 

Gasana, a native of the impoverished Rwanda, says he was inspired to research health hazards, such as lead poisoning in low-income family homes.

 "My ongoing research work [is] aimed at uplifting children suffering from environmental health hazards," Gasana said. "My active involvement with various agencies and health centers, with the goal of improving the environmental conditions of low-income families, speaks to my vision and commitment to improve the standard of the living poor and needy families." 

Another show featured Dr. Helen Cornely, Associate Professor from the Department of Physical Therapy, who dedicated her research to preventing the elderly from falling. 

"Falls are a major health problem in older adults," Cornely said. "We are now working on analyzing [the] falls of older adults in the Fort Lauderdale Airport. This is very exciting because this is a new area of fall prevention and a very important issue, as the baby boomers know no other ways of traveling but by air."

The ninth show is presently being edited, and  is scheduled to air in the second half of February. Cable-Tap approved three more FIU shows; however, there is no funding for them at this time. 

When asked about possible future projects Thirunarayanan said, "I don't work in the university graduate school anymore. But I do have ideas for other shows, maybe shows that highlight teaching and teaching methods."

Headline: Explosion fizzles on first release
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
The album Black Tape by the band The Explosion seems to showcase a failed attempt at an old school Green Day style of music. The band starts off the album with a song titled "Deliver Us" which, in my opinion, is the best song on the entire album. 

The only positive thing about putting this song as the first track is that it gives listeners something to which they can look forward. After hearing the first song, I thought, "Wow, this isn't half bad." My thoughts drastically changed around track five.

If I were to pick one word to describe the whole album it would have to be repetitive. Most songs linger around the same lyrics, deliver the same kind of message throughout each song and never show any signs of change.

The overall quality of the Black Tape is less than moderate. The only positive thing I could find about it would have to be its art. Dark and gloomy images that have absolutely nothing in common with the lyrics fill the pages of the cover art. 

Even though the art note-worthy, fans of rock music don't necessarily buy an album for its art, no matter how good it is. The ambiance of the album is that of any other early '90s punk rock band's, and lends nothing new to the ear - nothing original here.

The Explosion hits the road this year with a tour for their new album. Maybe hearing them live will fill the void left by their repetitive lyrics, unoriginal song choices and plain old lack of musicianship on Black Tape.

Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
1. ZOMBIE MOVIES

Nothing makes for a better weekend movie-fest than a Zombie marathon. From "Shaun of the Dead" to "Dead Alive," from "Re-Animator" to the classic "Night of the Living Dead," one can always count on cannibalistic corpses to really liven a college night.

2. NEIL GAIMAN'S "THE SANDMAN" SERIES

These graphic novels revolutionized the comic book world a decade ago. Written by British essayist/poet/novelist Neil Gaiman and illustrated by some of the industry's greatest artists, the poignant stories about the doomed King of Dreams transcend comics and read like classic literature.

3. HOMESTARRUNNER

Almost every college student in America should be familiar with the internet-only cartoons found at www.homestarrunner.com. Nothing online beats the fan e-mails that luchador look-alike Strongbad reads and sarcastically answers as well as the random humor of high school losers "Teen Girl Squad."

4. BIKING

I'll admit I can't perform any of the tricks people do these days on their bikes (I love my limbs too much). Still, the best thing about the week is riding through the residential quad on my bike on windy days.

5. FREE STUFF

Residential college students quickly become experts in finding free stuff, like the cups the Student Government Association gives away,  the truckloads of Student Organizations Council shirts or the chairs offices throw away when they are moving to the new Graham Center expansion. How would we survive without free Publix ham croquette samples?

Headline: Legacy left behind in Rap star's Mixtape
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"I've never saw so many people tonight. Y'all got it all crowded up in here, and that's good.  I'm glad y'all giving it up. Y'all make me want to cry or something. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is a special night. Let me introduce myself. My name is Russell Jones. Tonight you're gonna see something that you've never seen before, something that nobody in the history of hip-hop ever set himself to do." - Ol' Dirty Bastard on "Return to the 36 Chambers"

The world of hip-hop was heartbroken upon hearing of the abrupt death of Russell Jones, a.k.a. Ol' Dirty Bastard, Ason, Big Baby Jesus, Osirus and Dirt McGirt. At the age of 35, he suffered from a severe heart attack on Nov. 13, 2004. Many of his fans are still in mourning.

One week before his death, Dirty finished the final vocal mixes on what was to be his comeback album, Osirus: The Official Mixtape, which was released on Jan. 4. 

Known for his unorthodox and entertaining style of rhyming, and after spending years away from the music scene due to legal troubles, Dirty returns with a tale of his legacy in the game of hip-hop. The album shows a more mature and coherent Dirty, without losing his classic appeal. 

The opening track, "Pop Shots (Wu-Tang)," has a classic early, mid-'90s DJ Premier (Gang Starr) trademark beat. Dirty rhymes about growing up in Brooklyn, falling in love with hip-hop and all those who suffered from the wrath of his fiery lyrics. 

This track itself could easily be considered one of the most brilliant come-back tracks released to date. It lets all of the nay-sayers know that even though he was out of the game for a while, he never lost his skills. A re-mix of the track also appears as one of three bonus tracks.

The track, "Dirty, Dirty" has more of a classic sound.  A funky piano line, along with a helium filled voice on the chorus, are reminiscent of the Parliament's "Aqua Boogie." 

Some of the more memberable lines on the album are when Dirty says, "Twosteps from the boarder line, anything closer will kiss the nine/ Think I'm out of the game, you're out of your mind/'Cause I keep it on track like Transit Line."

The album contains guest appearances by RZA, Capadonna, Black Rob, Baby Sham, Drag-on and the human beat-box himself, Rahzel, just to name a few.  The production is creative, crisp and clear with help from D.J. Premier, "Ill" Will, Chops and K-Def of Black Soul Music.  Young Guru even assists in the final mixing of several tracks.  Unlike a lot of artists that use samples in their music, the majority of cuts were taken from previous Dirty albums.

Dirty shows true versatility on "Don't Stop Ma" and "Down South," which are beats influenced by the South. They could easily become future club hits.

As a founding member of the Wu-Tang Clan, Dirty took the hip-hop world by storm in 1993, along with RZA (Robert Diggs), Genious (Gary Grice) and six other local New York MCs, with the release of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Dirty stood out among the rest because of his "off the wall" rhyme patterns and wild antics.

Dirty could be considered one of the most misunderstood and overlooked MCs in all of hip-hop. If rap music was compared to late-night talk shows, then Ol' Dirty Bastard would be Johnny Carson. An album like this would be the best way to go out - on top.

Whether you call him Ol' Dirty Bastard, Osirus, Ason, Big Baby Jesus or just plain Russell, he will be forever remembered and missed as one of the most innovative minds in all of hip-hop.

If you haven't heard of the Facebook, you've been living under a rock. And if you're not addicted to it, then you're a far more normal person than most people will ever be. 

Since February 4, 2004, www.thefacebook.com, has quickly become popular in over 300 universities which is about one million students nationwide. It started out as a personal project for Mark Zuckerberg of Harvard University.

In a Current Magazine interview in November 2004, Zuckerberg said Harvard was "a fairly unfriendly place." So, he wanted to create an online directory for all students.

Next thing he knew, Yale University and Stanford University were joining in, and the rest is history. Facebook has become an online scene of sorts where you can look up people with whom you went to high school, or people you just met at last night's party.

"I joined it last month because all my friends were doing it," said freshman 

Rebecca Casas. "Now I am addicted. I have found close to 30 former high school and middle school friends."

The Facebook is an interactive online community where you also get the chance to interact with different people at your university. There's one community for each university. 

You can also befriend other people at different universities by doing a global search. If you choose to list the classes you're taking on the profile you make and display, the Facebook will let you know if there is anybody else who has also listed the same courses. 

One of the more popular features is the high school search engine. The Facebook allows you to search for users in different high schools and graduating classes. For example, you can type in the high school and graduating class of the person for whom you are searching, and see a list of people who meet this criteria. You'd never believe how many old friends you can dig up.

The Facebook creates a network of people that you might otherwise never know. The site allows you to send messages, similar to e-mails, that appear in the message section of your account. During the first week of this semester many FIU users sent messages advertising books for sale.

After you find the person you are looking for there are also full, in-depth profiles to browse that Facebook users post, 

giving every bit of detail, from whether or not they are in relationships, to their hobbies and favorite movies. Of course, you can keep your profile skimpy if you wish to remain "mysterious," but the juicy ones are always fun to read. Additionally, you can click on a certain interest and it will list all other users with that same interest in the university community. 

The wall section is another favorite. On each user's profile exists a digital wall that people can edit by adding comments or deleting someone else's (but don't worry, the user has priority access and can undo someone's edit). 

Perhaps the most random aspect of the Facebook is the "poking" option. It has no specific purpose but can be interpreted in many ways. For example, poking someone could mean "Hi!," "Just thinking of you" or it could simply mean "I obviously, have nothing better to do, so I'm randomly poking and you're IT!"

Users on the Facebook can also choose to join groups within the main university community. These groups can become incredibly specific ranging from a group for WRGP, the campus radio station, to people whose name starts with the letter J. For fans of "Zoolander," there's a Derek Zoolander's Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good and Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too group.

"I love Facebook because I was able to create my own group for the Orange County fans. I've met different kinds of people through it," said sophomore Christine Guzman. "It is also funny because I have a few friends that failed finite math, and there's even a group [for] that."

A new feature on the Facebook is the ability to send messages to friends' mobile phones. By inputting your mobile phone number, messages can be sent to and from other users as text messages via their mobile phone.

All you need is a university e-mail to be part of your university's Facebook community. Create a profile, post a hot photo of yourself and start adding friends. It's really that simple. It's difficult to describe why joining the Facebook is fun and addicting- it just is. Once you start, it'll be hard to pull away and you'll soon find yourself checking your wall and message board a few times a day.
