Headline: Additions to Sculpture Park find new home
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Look across the lawn near the Blue and Gold Garages, and the MARC building won't be the only new addition you'll find. 

There, poking up from the grass, will also be three new sculptures which have arrived on a 10-year loan to join University Park's  Martin Z. Margulies Sculpture Park, which already includes works by such prominent artists as Dubuffet, Miro, Nevelson, Noguchi and Serra. 

Similar to the sculpture on the south lawn of the University House and made by the same artist, Arnie Zimmerman, these three new pieces, including "Big Twister" and "Crane," were handmade of industrial ceramic materials and are reminiscent of totem poles. 

"Zimmerman's complicated spiraling organic imagery in a vertical architectural format holds off the tough competition of both our beautiful natural setting and the strongly-designed nearby buildings, and emphasizes this effect by tropical and evocative coloration," said Carol Foster, associate director of The Art Museum. 

Inside the MARC building are also two other sculptures; these  are plaster mold sculptures, one of which has been cast in bronze and displayed elsewhere. The other is the only one of its kind, making it a rarity, right here at FIU. 

These five new acquisitions will certainly not be the last to arrive, as the Sculpture Park is constantly changing.

In fact, all of UP serves as a giant outdoor sculpture museum with more than 70 pieces scattered over the entire campus.  Every year it is visited by international art and sculpture enthusiasts. 

"We have really famous pieces here ... last year during Art Basel, visitors from all over the world made a special trip to FIU to see  [the sculptures]," said Foster. 

According to the museum's website, the Sculpture Park is "recognized nationally as one of the world's most important collections of sculpture and the largest on a university campus."   

So keep your eyes peeled for new sculptures and moved sculptures as you walk through the al fresco museum we call college.

Guided tours of the sculpture park are offered thoughout the year for groups of 10 or more for those who would like to know a little more about what they're seeing.  Twilight tours are also available for groups of 20 or more. For more information or to schedule a tour,  call The Art Museum at 305-348-2890.

Headline: Music fans unite, stop quibbling over genre
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
I am one of those people who gets angry and even a little bitter when it comes to discussing music and the types of music that achieve popularity. I loathe MTV, and as far as listening to commercial radio goes, I would rather chop off my own two ears. 

My music library is mostly comprised of bands and artists most people have never heard of; how many of you can honestly say you've heard of groups like The Dismemberment Plan, Q and not U, Broadcast or Belle and Sebastian? 

A year ago, maybe even a few months ago, I would have said something along the lines of: "For those of you who haven't heard of these bands, consider yourselves uneducated swine and slaves to the corporate music monsters who force-feed you horrendously hopeless music."

Several things have occurred to me recently however, that have given me a slightly different perspective on the current state of affairs regarding the music world. I used to try and determine who exactly was to blame for the way things were in music. Are companies such as MTV and Clear Channel Communications to be blamed, or is it the listeners' fault? 

Should we call out the record companies, or is it the bands themselves who plot and scheme to lock up the industry and steal all the wealth? Was there even an issue to be debated?

After giving it much thought, I've decided that it's really not about blaming anyone. This is the way it's been for years; the only difference is the music. 

Since the beginning of the music industry, the popular, user-friendly music always achieves popularity first. Sure you can shame companies like Clear Channel for their devious methods, but the music that you hear on television and the radio is just so easy to digest, no wonder it's popular. What you hear is mostly catchy, direct and straightforward, with very few exceptions.

 Oftentimes, the original and unique tends to be a little obscure and strange. It's difficult to enjoy something you may not be familiar with; it takes a little open-mindedness and imagination sometimes.

This brings me to the next point in my little self-revelation. Who am I to decide what is "bad" and "good"? It's all about personal opinion, because as much as I'll praise Q and not U, some other person is going to disagree. Likewise, as much as I say that 50 Cent and Hillary Duff are the worst things to happen in music this year, I'll have billions, including some close friends, waiting in line to throw tomatoes at me. 

The problem with the crowd of people who are, like myself, into alternative types of music, is that they become very overprotective and often vicious about musical politics. Even among unpopular music, a band or two will rise up to take the popularity cake within that genre or scene of music. I've seen it happen and it's not uncommon for others to shy away from that particular band, denounce others who listen to it, or even lie about not liking them simply to make a statement. It becomes less and less about how good a band actually is and more about how "scene" they are, or how unknown and unpopular they are. 

For example, take Dashboard Confessional, a band that teeters in the popular mix. Their catchy swan songs earned them a huge fan base in no time. Ever since their MTV stardom, one can notice a decline in "underground" or "scene" support. It's one thing not to like the group because you simply don't dig the music, but it's another to purposely stop liking them because they have a popular fan-base. That's just ridiculous.

So what's the common ground people must find in order to settle this? Well, quite frankly, there isn't much to be settled. The opinions individual people hold about art and music are not so easily changed. It will take an enigma within popular music to sway the masses and this happens every so often, such as with the '90s grunge-rock and gangster rap revolutions.

I tend not to care so much anymore about what my roommate, for example, listens to. He turns on Evanescence and I turn on The Dismemberment Plan. There's no use in arguing over who sucks and who doesn't, it's all in our heads anyway.

Headline: A 'fresh' perspective on college life
Author: Emily Jensen/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
As this summer came to an end something dawned on me, for the first time in my life, I was not required to be anywhere. No longer was I legally bound to attend school. My parents had finally let go, and I was free to live my own life, however I chose. With a world of options awaiting me, I had made my decision.

School has always been a priority of mine thus I had included college in my post-high school plans. Born and raised in a white affluent, suburban town; I was eager to find a new and different environment.  

I had graduated from what was known as the "lily white" high school located in a town divorced from reality. It is a place where the inhabitants construct this make-believe bubble around the entire town to protect themselves from the "big bad world" that surrounds them. The longer I stayed there the more I wanted to get away.

My search for a diverse environment had led me to Florida International University. The acceptance letter had arrived and the paperwork signed I was on my way from escaping the bubble.    

I do admit I was slightly intimidated by the city of Miami's reputation, but I was ready for an adventure. But thus far I have handled the change quite well.  

See, I wanted the "college experience" without living in a "college town." Miami is a city rich in culture that I am unfamiliar with, inhabited by people of all ages and social standings, an incredibly appealing idea for me.  

Being the person I am I yearned to go to big public school that still had enough interest in their students success where I wouldn't just fade away into the masses. I quickly gathered, however, that FIU like any university is it this business to make money. I do feel that people are looking out for me. Every time I was struggling even though it took me forever to figure out which of the many offices I should address, someone has been there to answer any questions I had as well as offer solutions. If I did have one complaint it would be the school's lack of organization: events never seem to start promptly, registering for classes proved to be a headache, not to mention the fact the course catalog was just now released in print form.

FIU has opened its arms to welcome the Class of 2007. After attending orientation I felt like I had a basic understanding of the services FIU had to offer and was ready to begin class.

Being from out of town and unfamiliar with the area, I made the decision to live on campus. I was placed in Honors Place at Panther Hall, a community of fellow honors students. To this point campus living has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my college experience. I go to class, eat, hang out, and study, all the time having more and more fun with these kids. Living on campus adds social aspect to school, which definitely enriches the event. The monotony of going to school, and returning home to study would definitely get to me very quickly. Living in the dorms is far from monotonous.  Something is always going on, there is always someone to talk to, and everyone can relate to what you are going through. It is a refreshing change from the conservative environment I am accustomed to.

As for providing a diverse environment FIU has lived up to my expectations. I have never been in a minority before. Here at FIU that I most certainly am the minority. Everywhere I go on campus, I meet someone new from somewhere I wish I had the pleasure to go. 

The people here have exposed me to new music, new thoughts, new perspectives, and new language. The fact that people automatically assume I knew Spanish shocked me. English was an expectation back home. The more I venture into Miami the more I realize Spanish is an expectation. I most certainly hope that a by-product of attending school here will be the fact that I will learn some conversational Spanish.  

Some people say first impressions are everything. After attending classes for only two weeks the impression FIU has left me with just about everything I could have hoped for. 

The people I have encountered for the most are part friendly, and helpful. I've been impressed with my professors, course content, and assignments.  

I hope FIU will continue to facilitate the type of college experience I wish to have. 

I am confident with my first adult decision I think it will prove to be an incredible academic and social growing experience.

Headline: Part 3: New York, all work and some plays
Author: John Colagrande, Jr./ Staff Columnist
&nbsp;
This is the last segment of a three-part column.



August: I was in New York on business, sort of. Wasn't getting paid. There were no meetings. And I didn't have an itinerary. My mission was to smell, touch, taste, watch, and listen to New York. 

I was writing a novel that was partly set in the city and to add a sense of realism my memory and imagination couldn't buy, I wanted to be there.

There were problems. New York was loud, loud, LOUD - the vvrroom of motors - jackhammers d-d-d-d-d-d - car horns MEEP MEEP. Hard to concentrate. 

I was getting into fights. Budget was low. I was getting my ass kicked, literally, figuratively, financially, mentally, my ass was getting kicked by any and all "ly"s, even by Bruce Lee - and Bruce Lee was dead. To top it off, then came the blackout. 

The power disappeared on one of the hottest days of the year at 95 degrees.  Not a cloud in the sky, all flags impotent - no wind. Outside Eugene O'Neal's revival of "Long Day's Journey Into Night," a man held up a radio. 

We all gathered and the voice of the mayor said - everything is under control - we spoke to Con Ed - it's just a power outage - this is not terrorism - hopefully we can kick back soon and say "Where were you when the lights went out?" 

It was too much. I had to concentrate. Had to get the work done. 

Soon as the power returned I hit the library. 

Astor Hall of the NYC Public Library - 5th Ave. and 40th St. 

You walk in - bling bling. 

If information had a Mecca it would be Astor Hall. 

If knowledge were into repatriation, the Hall would be its destination. 

You look at the benefactor's wall and know you stepped up to bat in the Big Leagues with names like Hamilton, Kennedy, Whitney, Rockefeller, and Hastings. 

Coolest library in the world.

You lose yourself in work. You can combat anything with work. Bored? Work. Depressed? Work. You're lonely? Then work. Big city kicking your butt? Work it. 

Work, work, work. Whistle while you work. 

 When you have work you have a purpose. You get into a rhythm. If you enjoy your work you find your cadence, your melody, your flow. Life becomes a song. Sing it.

After working all day in the NYC library, the only thing that made sense to me was to see a musical. 

Most musicals in Manhattan have rush and student tickets available for around $20. "Rent" and "Avenue Q" offer a lottery two hours before curtains up. You put your name in a hat and they pick 20 names and if you win they give you two first row orchestra seats for $20 each. 

In five days I saw five musicals: "Rent," "Urinetown," "Phantom of the Opera," "The Producers," and "Avenue Q."

Musicals are weird. As a result of seeing so many musicals, your thoughts, and consequently your phonetics, morph into a strictly lyrical mode. 

You would have to see me/reading this article live/to get a true sense of the lyrical/madness that took over my mind - it was a bit overwhelming.

"I LOVE NY," is that city's slogan. 

I love NY, although New York is probably more complicated than a three-word mantra. 

But the lesson I learned is as long as you're alive it is essential to take care of business, work, work, work, and get some culture every now and then.

Headline: Common criminal confesses music misdemeanors
Author: Daniel Muela/ Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
So yesterday I committed a crime. I figure it isn't the smartest thing to say in public, but maybe I'm not the smartest guy around. 

Anyway like I was saying I committed a crime, and it wasn't anything like murder or pushing an old person or something, no. 

My crime was downloading and listening to Badly Drawn Boy on my computer. So I know this means that I could get sued or thrown to the lions, but I'm here asking myself, "Should I be scared that the record industry is suing everyone and their grandmothers?"

I mean lets put it into perspective. There are literally millions of people online downloading and uploading songs. The Record Industry Association of America has seen severe drops in sales totals as of result of many factors, not just file sharing. 

So there are millions out there trading music, and the RIAA doesn't have all the money they are used to. 

Now I'm not a math major in anyway, but even I can get an idea of how much it will cost to sue millions of people. They do not have the lawyers, the money, or the guts to sue everyone. 

But hey just for fun let's entertain the thought suing all of us. They have used up all their money on lawsuits and cock fights and whatnot. 

Then they realize that slumping sales were not all due to the fact that people were getting their music online. 

They realize that they have been pushing an inferior product. 

Or maybe that through legal 'burning" software, all it takes is one person in a group to buy a CD then all their friends have to do is borrow it and just like that the RIAA loses at least 10 customers.

 So their sales drop anyway. And because they've sued everyone no one wants anything to do with them.

Maybe some don't really understand when I say an inferior product. Well the last time I bought a CD it cost in the neighborhood of $15. What I got was a little piece of plastic with 12 songs , and a little booklet with lyrics and production notes.

Now, for free, I get all the songs I want with the internet. It's a bit of an understatement to say the scales are tipped here. 

The scales have fallen over. I understand that competing with unlimited free songs is hard. But maybe if the RIAA would provide a legal alternative that surpasses the CD, they would get some customers back.

Something that most don't get is why aren't the artists a bit more ticked off? 

Sure Metallica and Missy Elliot have openly opposed file sharing. But why aren't all artists taking a stand and saying stop?

 Well for two reasons. Right now the RIAA looks like the big evil corporation, and artists who have sided with them have payed for it by looking like sellouts, and having album sales drop (Metallica really doesn't need any help in this department.) 

But the reason that most people don't realize is that the RIAA has so much more to lose than the artist. You wouldn't know it by watching MTV Cribs, but most artists never see the majority of the money that their music makes. 

Most artists' music belongs to the RIAA and the artists themselves only own a small percentage of the song.

 So while this rapper might make 10 percent off every CD sold, the RIAA makes at 70 percent. 

And the artists, unlike the RIAA, have the talent to break away and become independent or come up with their own marketing campaign. 

The RIAA only has the album sales. So if the album sales drop, guess who gets hit the hardest? Very good , the RIAA. Wasn't that simple? So can anyone really blame the RIAA for reacting so harshly? 

Yeah, I for one can. 

I think that its is wrong and just plain dumb that the RIAA have put all their monkeys into one barrel and decided to sue the pants off of everyone who thinks they can listen to P. Diddy for free (Personally I think you should get committed for paying to listen to P. Diddy, but I digress.) 

I mean for a company to sue all it's potential customers is the biggest public relations poison I have ever heard of. 

I mean instead of investing all their money and resources into something more practical, they decided that everyone must go down. 

Its unsound in so many ways that it just makes any person with an IQ over 50 just stand in awe of the utter stupidity of one corporation of supposed professionals. 

But then again, these are the same people who gave Kelly Osborne a career, so my expectations weren't really all that high in the first place.

Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
FIU, which has only won at home or on neutral ground, looked to pick up its first road victory against FAU.

The 25th-ranked Golden Panthers didn't get exactly what they were looking for, but avoided their second straight road loss with a 1-1 tie with Owls in Boca Raton on Sept. 17.

The game went to overtime, but both teams managed to stay scoreless after the two extra periods.

FIU (3-2-1) jumped out to an early lead in the game when senior John Pulido buried a penalty kick in the 16th minute. Pulido sent the ball into the left side of the net, while Owls' goalkeeper Anders Granstad dove right, giving FIU a 1-0 advantage. The goal was Pulido's second of the season.

However, it didn't take long for FAU to find the equalizer as midfielder Bjorn Totland directed his fourth goal of the season past FIU goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg to tie the game at one.

The Golden Panthers came out strong after halftime with an apparent goal off of a free kick in the 50th minute. However, an offsides call negated the goal and the game remained scoreless.

The Owls provided a scare of their own in the final minute of the second overtime when defender Jeremi Isaacs found himself one-on-one with Rosenberg, but the FIU goalkeeper charged the ball and recorded his eighth save of the game to preserve the draw.

The Golden Panthers were outshot 16-14 in the contest, but held the edge on corner kicks with a 10-6 advantage. Pulido led FIU with four shots.

Rosenberg's strong performance improved his goals against average to 1.45 on the season. The senior goalkeeper now has 31 saves on the season.

&nbsp;
With a 3-1 victory over host New Hampshire University Sept. 20, FIU won the New Hampshire Tournament.

The team now stands at 8-3 on the season after winning two of three games in the tournament.

The Golden Panthers won the first set over UNH 30-27, led by a five-kill effort by tournament Most Valuable Player Jennifer Owens.

FIU played more dominantly in the second set by taking it 30-23 over the Wildcats, but UNH bounced back to win the third set 30-23 over FIU by finishing the set with 15 kills on only four attack errors.

The match went into the fourth set and the Wildcats got off to an early 7-1 lead over FIU. The match went back and forth, but the Golden Panthers took control of the game by going up 27-26 and eventually clinching the match and tournament with a 31-29 victory.

Senior Adriana Fundora finished the match five kills and seven digs to lead FIU.

FIU defeated the Wildcats despite the home court advantage of UNH.

"They had all their fans and cheerleaders cheering them on and we only had ourselves. We lived by our motto which is whatever it takes, no regrets," said Jessica Jones who was named to the all-tournament team.

The tournament victory sparked FIU, which will now begin to play games in their conference.

"You always want to win tournaments. This is building confidence for us now going into conference play," said head coach Cookie Stevens.

FIU began the tournament with a long, hard fought victory over Syracuse. FIU won 3-2.

The Golden Panthers were led by a career-best 25-digs by Elizabeth Baldwin. Fundora added a double-double with 20 kills and 15 digs. Jessica Jones added a match high .316 hitting percentage on 16 kills. 

After dropping the first set 30-23, FIU bounced back to win the second 30-24. Their winning spirit carried on to the third by winning the set 30-23. FIU hit .348 for the game.

With the Golden Panthers leading 2-1, Syracuse tied the match at two with a 30-28 victory in the fourth set. In the fifth and final set, Fundora led FIU with four kills and a 15-11 victory over the Orangewomen despite being out shot  .357 to .154.

The long game proved an important opening victory for FIU.

"It was a long game but we never gave up. We just kept pushing and it felt good to win," said Jones.

FIU won the tournament despite a 3-0 loss to Rhode Island in the second game. Down 27-19 in the first set, FIU staged a comeback by winning nine of the next 11 points, but ended up losing 30-28. 

The Rams never looked back, winning 30-25 in set two and 30-27 in set three. Owens and Fundora led with nine kills and 12 digs respectively for the Golden Panthers.

For her efforts, Fundora was named to the All-Tournament team along with MVP Owens and Jones. Jones tallied 37 kills and 18 blocks for the tournament to lead the way for FIU.  Fundora recorded her sixth straight double-double and added 48 kills and 48 digs.

Coach Stevens was especially proud of the girls making the all tournament team.

"Their play was outstanding. They had a great weekend and finished with lots of kills, digs, and blocks. They along with the rest of the team always come out to play with lots of passion," said Stevens.

Headline: Football loses DB Weaver
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
If FIU could do away with the third quarter things may be looking a little bit rosier. The Golden Panthers have lost two starters in the quarter and possible a third after defensive end Dane Ireson went down clutching his knee against B-CC in what is becoming a recurring theme for FIU.

The most noteworthy of the injuries would be the possible career-ending anterior cruciate ligament tear sustained by senior safety Jermell Weaver. The UM transfer was expected to have a productive season after healing from the same knee injury last season.

Weaver, who came on strong after missing the first two games last year hurt his left knee in the 24-14 loss to Maine a week ago. The fifth-year senior had four-and-half tackles this year including one sack.

FIU was uncertain as to the severity of the knee injury until Sept. 18 when the information was finally released. 

Strock had a feeling it was an ACL earlier last week, and mentioned they would petition the NCAA's governing body to grant the 6-2, 190 pound Weaver a medical redshirt and an extra year of eligibility. 

Weaver was fourth on the team with 50 tackles last season and was a member of UM's 2001 national championship team.

Last year's starter John Haritan will now see exclusive playing time at strong safety in Weaver's absence. Matt Castillo will back up Haritan.

Ireson limped off the field in the third quarter, with what was being called a sprain. An MRI will be conducted to determine the severity of the injury sometime this week.

Strock also plans on applying for a medical redshirt for quarterback Jamie Burke, who tore his ACL in the season opener against Indiana State.

Headline: PRO/CON: Who should be FIU's starting quarterback?
Subheadline: Tabor has experience FIU needs
Author: Mike Hernandez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Experience. This is the biggest and strongest reason why David Tabor should be the one calling the shots for the FIU offense. 

Head coach Don Strock decided on giving Jamie Burke the job of being the starting quarterback shortly before the inaugural contest on Aug, 28, 2002. Although Burke has the more impressive credentials: 2A player of the year at Sarasota Cardinal Mooney High School in 1999, 14 touchdowns his freshman year at FIU in 2002 - the older Tabor has the advantage of being in the FIU system for three years now. Tabor has also proven that he can come into tough circumstances and produce just as he did three weeks ago in the Golden Panthers' opener against Indiana State. 

While Burke failed to move the team down the field, Tabor came in and directed FIU's lone scoring drive going 3-for-4 for 34 yards. Tabor also threw for 539 yards last season while appearing in all 11 games in '02 despite not starting one contest.

After Burke tore his right ACL for the third time in four years during the Indiana State contest, Tabor was named the starter. Strock gave him just one quarter to "prove" himself against Maine in FIU's second game of the season. Tabor struggled throwing for just 17 yards. 

Strock, a backup quarterback in the NFL for 16 years, has drawn comparison to former UF offensive guru Steve Spurrier in his quarterback shuffling system. Strock, like Spurrier, is offensive-minded and loves his quarterbacks, concentrating on the position more than any other on his team. My problem with this manner of coaching is that although it may bring an offensive jolt as it did in the Indiana State and Maine games, the long-term results aren't as beneficial. An offense needs to have a consistent leader. That leader needs to be someone the team feels at ease with.

Tabor is that man for FIU.

"David is a great competitor and our team has always rallied around him when he's played," Strock said shortly after naming Tabor the starter against Maine. "He's been here learning the system now for three years and he was third in the balloting for team captain so there is a lot of respect for him by his teammates." 

So why then did Strock stick with redshirt freshman Josh Padrick in his struggles against B-CC? If Burke would get pulled after a half of trouble, why didn't Padrick come out despite his failure to move the offense downfield in the first half? Why didn't Tabor get an opportunity? The answer can only be known if Strock comes out and publicly says why. It would be extremely intriguing to listen to his reasoning here.

Padrick is the most athletic of the FIU quarterback trio. But Padrick also came from a high school where the option quarterbacking system was dominant. This is a direct contrast to what Strock wants for his offensive attack. King Strock loves to air the ball out. Proof of this came in the loss to Bethune-Cookman, the seventh-ranked team in the nation. FIU passed 41 times. Padrick completed just 11 passes for 143 yards and no touchdowns. If Tabor is in, FIU scores more and maybe even has a chance to win. It's not a theory. It's a fact. At the very least, Tabor completes more than 11 passes after having 41 chances. 

At 5-11, he may not be the tallest of the quarterbacks, or the one with the strongest arm. But Tabor is a leader. Although he has a calm demeanor and most likely would never speak out against Strock, maybe someone else should.

Consider what Strock said after falling to the Wildcats: "We're still learning what it takes to win. Somebody's got to step up and make a play on offense." Coach, the answer to your search was standing on the sideline Saturday evening, longing for just a shot to show what he can do.

Headline: PRO/CON: Who should be FIU's starting quarterback?
Subheadline: Padrick has athleticism Tabor lacks
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Given the situation FIU is in, Josh Padrick is the better option at quarterback. Yea, yea, I know he only completed 27 percent of his passes. 27 percent? Ewww. 

But, he is the more physically gifted of the two quarterbacks not sidelined with a knee injury the rest of this season. As a former option quarterback that just happens to have a pretty good arm, Padrick is able to do things that backup David Tabor cannot.

He is able to scramble outside the pocket when pressured. I know he did not appear to throw to well on the run against Bethune-Cookman and he didn't appear to throw well planted, off a three, five or seven-step drop either. 

However, Padrick has the athleticism that Tabor does not. His ability to move in the pocket gives this team the best chance to win. 

Tabor has been the backup quarterback since he arrived here, and has done a wonderful job in that role.

So why change things?

Tabor is used to coming off the bench, and knows how to lead the team in late-game situations.

The truth is, there are athletes that are simply better fit to be backups. Why do you think head coach Don Strock had a 17-year NFL career, many of which came as a team's number two. Well, Dan Marino would be one reason for the latter part of the coach's career, but because he was just more apt to handle that role. Some quarterbacks, pitchers, etcetera are more comfortable doing this than starting in the limelight every game. 

Sure, everyone wants to be a starter. I haven't met a backup yet that says: "I love this role I have, just come in when it hits the fan. Woo hoo!" But whether they can handle it is a different story.

Let's go back to Strock. In 1982 he rallied the Dolphins from a 24-point deficit in the Orange Bowl against the San Diego Chargers in the playoffs. The coach was inserted by Don Shula to relieve David Woodley in the second quarter of the ballgame.

So if Strock can execute this tremendous comeback and lead Miami to one of the greatest finishes in NFL history - overtime loss to the Chargers at the hands of Kellen Winslow (the original version), why couldn't he do the same thing as a starter?

For the same reason that Tabor would come in when Burke was all over the place and execute touchdown drives with a sniper's precision. Mentally, there are guys that can just come in and slow things down, get them back on track. Then there are guys that can be there most of the time as starters.

We already mentioned Strock, but let's cross boundaries, explore some examples elsewhere perhaps. 

Take the closer in baseball. Anyone heard of Eric Gagne? The Los Angles Dodgers closer leads the league in saves and is on pace to break numerous records. Dominating the position in a way that no one has ever seen. As a starter, though, his numbers were anything but memorable. 

And don't you think that the best pinch-hitter in major league history, Lenny Harris, would be a good enough hitter to start? He never was a full-time starter because of his ability to thrive off the bench.

But enough with cross-sporting. Back to football. Earl Morrall, a backup for the Dolphins in 1972 helped lead the Fins to their undefeated mark of 17-0 in Bob Griese's absence. He was also a member of the Indianapolis Colts, backing up this guy...you may have heard of him; Johnny Unitas ring a bell?

Bottom line is Strock knows what he has in his two quarterbacks. He chose youth and athleticism over leadership and a veteran who has been here since the team was formed. 

But Strock knows he cannot ignore the talent Padrick possesses.

And if Padrick runs into trouble, Strock won't have to worry about having a proven backup, because Tabor is still there.

Headline: FIU unable to pull off home upset
Subheadline: Defense shines, but offense struggles vs. 7th-ranked Wildcats
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The defense that had previously allowed 226.5 yards per game on the ground stayed at home Sept. 20 as FIU turned in a very respectable performance  - holding Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference offensive MVP Allen Suber to 152 yards of offense  - stifling a high-powered B-CC attack. 

The Golden Panthers exchanged figurative, and at times literal blows with the seventh-ranked Wildcats, oft times being the aggressor of those exchanges. 

They swarmed the football, contained Suber and silenced all who criticized their run defense the last two seasons in their 24-14 loss to B-CC Saturday night at FIU Stadium before a sold-out crowd of 13,123. 

Even though his team outscored B-CC in the second half, head coach Don Strock is having a hard time finding the moral victory in this one.

"You take away the 100-something yards of penalties and that is a [heck] of a lot closer game," Strock said afterwards. "The defense played well, but they were on the field for too long. We need to be more disciplined.

"Hats off to Bethune, they controlled the clock and we have to try to control it because eventually they are going to wear down."

Despite committing 105 yards on 9 penalties, which has become a recurring theme, FIU (0-3) was still in the game with 6:52 to play when Adam Moss kicked a 43-yard field goal (an FIU record) to bring the score to 17-6.

Strock was faced with a fourth-and-six from B-CC's 27-yard line and elected to take a shot at the three points rather than risk coming away empty handed. 

"I wanted to put some points on the board and get back in it. If we don't get it, then that's two touchdowns," said Strock, hoping to get the ball back after a defensive stop.

But FIU's defense, which was on the field for 37:56 of the total 60 minutes in the game, finally cracked. They allowed Suber to get into the end zone on an eight-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter with 2:32 left. The drive laid FIU's hopes of winning to rest as it tacked off 4:20 seconds of the clock before giving the Panthers the ball back with a larger margin to overcome. B-CC led 24-6.

FIU drove back down the field and found a way to put more points on the board. 

Running back Diamos Demerritt scored on 6-yard dive play before freshman quarterback Josh Padrick ran in the two-point conversion. 

FIU trailed 24-14 before B-CC ran out the clock.

They made Suber's life nearly impossible all evening, never letting him get comfortable while executing B-CC's "Wyattbone" option attack.

The senior was held in check after gaining 268 total yards in last season's 31-0 shellacking at Lockhart Stadium. FIU's 3-4 enabled them to continuously come around the corner and flush the 5-10, 186 pound Suber out of the pocket or towards the middle of the field on running plays. 

"We usually dictate with the option," said Suber, who was suffering from symptoms of dehydration. "They came out with better schemes."

And possibly better talent as well. Freshmen linebackers Antwan Barnes and Alexander Bostic were constantly chasing, and running the "modern" quarterback down from behind. They disrupted B-CC's offense and enabled guys in the middle such as linebackers Mike Sherrill and Lance Preston and safety Nick Turnbull to make plays. 

Defensive end Daunte Foster and Preston added two sacks for a combined loss of 25 yards. FIU allowed a big chunk of its 303 yards on B-CC's final drive when it appeared as if the contest may have been further out of reach - down two scores with six minutes to play. 

Last season, FIU gave up 470 yards to the Wildcats.

"We played good and fought to it out until the end," said an exhausted Bostic afterwards. "Bethune-Cookman is a very good team and we played well because we had to stop Suber."

FIU was riddled once again by turnovers, penalties and the freshman mistakes of quarterback Josh Padrick, who made his first collegiate start.

Padrick, who completed 11-for-41 of his passes for 143 yards, was unable to establish any kind of rhythm. He threw two interceptions in only the second game he has seen action in and appeared to have his timing a little off as well. The redshirt freshman from Merritt Island, FL. was not taken out of the game by Strock. 

"For Dan Marino it was 16 millimeter film, for [Padrick] it is probably on fast-track. But that will slow down," Strock said. 

"I was considering [taking him out of the game], but not so much pulling him, but so he can get on the sidelines and see what is going on."

Two trips deep into B-CC territory were halted by a fumble and interception. Penalties also set up the Wildcats to score while marching down a short field.

B-CC took a 17-3 lead into halftime after Moss nailed a 33-yarder.

Headline: Respect should be paid even to controversial lecturers
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The FIU and local community showed commendable tolerance as Angela Davis, a civil rights activist and tenured professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz controversial for her leftist political ideology, lectured at the Eric E. Williams Lecture Series presented by the African New World Studies Program Sept. 19.  

Davis, a former U.S. vice presidential candidate on the Communist Party ticket, and Black Panther spoke to a full house about slavery, prison abolition, and social injustice. Davis spent two weeks evading the FBI before being arrested in 1970 for her alleged involvement in an attempted prison break, charges of which she was later acquitted.

Some speakers have come under fire at FIU campuses, and Davis' previous support of Fidel Castro and his regime stirred memories of a previous lecture, also presented by the ANWS Program, which featured Victor Dreke Cruz, a retired Cuban-Marxist General and alleged human rights violator.  

During that presentation, an incensed crowd became involved in a shouting match with Dreke, accusing Dreke of being a "murderer." The incident resulted in several members of the audience being escorted out of the room by security.

A lecture sponsored by the Venezuelan Student Association, which featured Carlos Matamoros, a radio personality, also turned ugly after Matamoros expressed support for the policies of Hugo Chavez, current president of Venezuela.  Matamoros was treated to jeers as members of the audience walked out.

But Davis was met with neither jeers, picketers, nor shouting matches, bucking a recent trend of intolerance among the FIU and Miami community. 

While it is a person's right to protest, a sentiment that Davis - a veteran demonstrator in her own right - would no doubt agree with, a university should always seek to facilitate the free expression of ideas. 

And that requires tolerance, which is not to say that audiences should feel compelled to buy wholesale another person's opinions, but it is to say that an audience should respectfully hear somebody out and protest in an organized manner.

Hopefully this past event is evidence that this community is headed in the right direction.

Headline: Davis' lecture draws large crowd
Author: Felicidad Garcia / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
More than 2,000 people arrived at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center on Sept. 19 to listen to civil rights activist and former Black Panther, Angela Y. Davis, lecture at the fifth annual Eric E. Williams Memorial Lecture. 

Hosted by the African New World Studies program, the lecture, "Slavery and the Prison Industrial Complex," was swarming with over 572 people sitting in the lecture hall, 99 standing in the overflow room, approximately 300 watching it on two television sets in the outdoor rotunda and some 1,000 disappointed souls turned away. 

The turnout was expected to be good for this popular, often times controversial speaker, but nothing like this. 

"I expected around 700 [people], but it is far beyond what I could have imagined, and I am very proud," Latrice Bruno, a senior in the ANWS program and event organizer for the evening, said. "We should have had a larger facility." 

Eric E. Williams (1911 - 1981) was best known as a historian, with his work, Capitalism and Slavery (1944), an account of the British West Indian slave industry and as the first Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago for the last 25 years of his life. 

He led the country to independence from Britain in 1962 and then on to Republican status in 1976.

In his memory, ANWS holds an annual lecture and tribute, which features prominent lecturers, world leaders and social reformists. 

Davis has been world-renowned as a political activist since the 1960s, and a scholar, having earned several degrees in the United States and abroad. 

At one point her political ideals sent her to prison for 16 months after she was charged with murder and kidnapping. She was later acquitted. It was during this time in jail that Davis first began writing and even used William's work for inspiration and research. 

"When I wrote my first article in a jail cell, Eric Williams' work was one of the major texts I consulted," Davis said from the podium.

Davis mainly lectured on her most recent work and interest, the prison industrial complex, in which parallels are drawn between prisons and slavery.

"Prison is one of those places [in which] racism has learned how to hide," she said. "Look at the population in prisons today and you'll see race matters in determining who gets to go to prison and who doesn't." 

Davis spoke for approximately 30 minutes, saying "I don't believe in the reform of the prison as an institution; I believe it needs to be abolished."

Despite the controversial nature of her lecture, it was not ill received, as other speakers have been in the past.

Much of her lecture caused sudden uproars of clapping, affirmations and 'Amens' from the audience. 

One introductory speaker, a professor of ANWS and history, Clarence Taylor, sparked the political firecracker in the audience as he criticized former president Ronald Reagan, saying, "he led a fierce campaign against civil rights ... he was a supporter of the racist apartheid regime." 

The issue of politics led to questions from audience members regarding issues such as the reduction of funding for educational programs in Florida. 

There were also questions about the simultaneous increase of funding for prisons, during the subsequent question and answer session.

"What we need to do is start movements," Davis advised. "And I don't use the word movement lightly. Radical social movements; I'm not talking about transplanting the '60s into the 21st century ... We have to take the notion of movements seriously. A demonstration is not a movement."

Bruno thought, Davis "made a fearless attempt to answer every question in a fair manner." 

To wrap up the event, messages from government officials including Governor Jeb Bush, Senator Bill Nelson and Senator Bob Graham, were read aloud by Heather Andrade, an assistant professor of English and ANWS affiliate, despite resounding boos against the majority of them, particularly Gov. Bush. 

His input was so unwanted that his message was not going to be read until it was decided that to ignore it would be "a violation of protocol."

In the past, such controversial speakers, especially ones associated with the communist party, have been unwelcome by many at FIU. 

That resulted in protests by students and community members alike. 

Last year, other lecturers - including Venezuelan journalist and supporter of Chavez's constitution, Carlos Matamoros, medical professor, Dr. Ana Morales Varela, and retired commander of the Cuban-Marxist revolution, Victor Dreke Cruz - attracted wild protests and shouting matches during their presentations. 

Professor Carole Boyce Davies, the director of ANWS, expressed concern about the public's reactions to this lecture, but she said that she worked closely with the president's office at FIU to ensure the success of the event. 

About negative reactions to past events she said, " I can understand why the Cuban community was upset [about Cruz's lecture]. Demonstrators are allowed to be, but they have to respect the intellectual community... The larger community in Miami needs to support each other's issues rather than competing."

Headline: 'Cloud 9' to provide relaxation
Author: Alain Castillo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In a small room with lights dimmed, as ambient sounds of cricket's symphony music plays, FIU Health and Wellness presents "Cloud 9", a program held every Wednesday that intends to provide students and staff with an opportunity to relax and have a moment of downtime. 

Funded by the Student Government Association, "Cloud 9", which began on Sept. 3, runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on both campuses, and is broken down into three different activity periods for each campus. At University Park, the event begins with the "Relaxed" period from 10 a.m. to noon as the Health Care and Wellness Center's conference room is transformed into a comfortable setting with cards, puzzles, coloring books, and bean bag chairs for students to sit in. Healthy snacks and teas are also provided.

"Stress is the number one problem [for students] and we want students to come to a place to unwind. They can get out of school, have a refreshment, and color," said Mariela Gabaroni, Wellness Coordinator.

From noon to 1 p.m., UP hosts its Brown Bag Lunch Presentation, an hour when different school departments gather weekly either solving an issue or discussing individual concerns. Massage Therapy sessions take place from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Students can also travel to the Biscayne Bay Campus and attend the yoga session from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Although the UP's "Cloud 9" does not yet include yoga, the staff will implement it when the new expansion of the center is complete.  

Following BBC yoga, there is a half-hour break before their Brown Bag Lunch Presentation from noon to 1 p.m. BBC also wraps up the event with a massage therapy session. 

"This is a place where students can just go and chill," Gabaroni said. Gabaroni says that if she were a student, she would attend. She adds that this is a quieter place [to study] if the library is filled with noise.

Roya Zolnoor, a master's candidate in the Department of Public Health, created this program. Zolnoor came up with the idea after reviewing the "Student Stress Survey", a survey which was managed by supervised student interns Sheena Mocur and Heather Richards during their summer 2002 field experience in Public Health.

The survey asked students on both campuses, individually and then combined, what caused them stress. 

Students at UP ranked lack of time as number one while BBC students ranked financial concerns as their top stress. Combined results yielded that 29.8 percent stated lack of time was the major stress, financial concerns ranked second at 29.5 percent, and classes and coursework at 20.4 percent. 

This being the case, 37 percent of the students requested personal stress management consultations and 35 percent said that they wanted stress clinics. 

The survey indicated that students would "most likely access the services" if massage therapy, yoga, and meditation was offered, illustrating that a stress management program was a necessity. 

Zolnoor took advantage of this need and formed "Cloud 9" as part of her internship project, but with a motivated interest as well. 

Wellness Center staff at both UP and BBC were trained by psychology intern Kity Laboriel, who works with the Counseling and Psychological Services Center. She also helped with the development of the stress assessment and consultation by describing how to deal with people, what type of counseling to give, and how to find signs of stress.  

The "Stress-Free Zone" serves as a double benefit for students who have consultations, so that they can find other problems that the student may have not identified.

"The interns were really interested," said Oscar Loynaz, assistant director of the UP Health and Wellness Center. He states that luck was on the staff's side and overall, the HWC has survived by the talent of the FIU students.

Despite officials having prevented transfusions of the contaminated blood, the new test used to detect the virus still reports findings, although the season was supposed to have passed. 

Although the new test has proven efficient in preventing the spread of contaminated blood, occasional occurrences prove that it is not a perfect system, officials said.

Persons who have received contaminated blood usually experience headaches and fevers following the transfusion.

Headline: Service initiative to improve customer service
Author: Francisco Zuniga / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This fall semester, under the recommendation of FIU president, Modesto Maidique, a "Service Excellence Initiative" is being put together in order to tackle the challenge of customer service in the university.

Lisa M. Gunther, director of organization, development, and learning in the Division of Human Resources was appointed for the specific task of planning and launching the initiative.

"I've been asked to revive this effort, and really launch an initiative that helps us in the university," said Gunther.

The need for such an initiative stemmed out of FIU's  "Millennium strategic Plan" in which maintaining "strategic operational and service excellence" was outlined as a main value for the institution.

"This initiative is designed to support our value of service excellence, and investigate and uncover what does service excellence look like at FIU," said Gunther.

The students also feel there are areas of customer service that need attention.

"I personally haven't experienced anything wrong with the system, but I know a lot of students have been complaining about the financial aid system, and about teachers being unavailable, as well as parking," said senior, Melissa Alba.

 Problems such as the use of the university's profit and the communication from department to department are concerns for students such as senior, Andres Solis, who works in the financial aid offices. 

" I think there needs to be a major revolution in FIU's costumer service protocol," said Solis, adding that "it wouldn't hurt to have all the major departments communicate with one another in order to reduce the amount of circles students have to run in to get things done."

Solis then went on to express his concern that things seem to be done for profit instead of the good of the student body. There are several specific goals to this initiative.

 The main ones are identifying the university's different constituent groups, discovering what they need, and assessing how effectively their needs are being met.  The initiative is aimed at improving customer service in all the departments and areas of the university, and is targeted towards students, staff, and faculty. 

There are three main areas to be considered for the development and success of the initiative. 

These areas are the university's culture or way of life, its systems and processes, and lastly, the knowledge and skills of staff and faculty. 

 "Those three legs of the stool are really what form the frame work of a service excellence initiative," Gunther said. 

 In order to help towards the realization of the initiative, Gunther plans to put together a task force. 

This team's job will be to go out to the different areas of the university and gather as much data as possible. Through this data they will then be able to find out who specifically makes up its constituent groups, and what each one is looking for or in need of. 

 "We don't presume to know what our customers want, but we go and ask," said Gunther.

 The gathering and assessment of all necessary data by the task force is planned to last until June 2004. After this, the initiative is to be implemented concretely into all the necessary areas. 

This task force's job is not only to find out what is missing from the university's customer service, but also, what is working. Gunther explained that it is necessary to not just look for the problems, but to celebrate the good service that is already being provided.

 "I've already been benchmarking other universities that do it very well," said Gunther, who is looking to such schools as Penn State, and the University of Cincinnati as examples of how to provide good customer service. 

 The customer service initiative is just one part of a larger plan to improve the general quality of the university's services. 

Aside from this initiative, the president of FIU has also chartered a task force for administrative excellence. 

"What I'm wanting to do from a service excellence point of view, really fits into a larger effort," said Gunther.

 The cost of this initiative has not been calculated as of yet since it is still being planned and detailed. 

 Learning programs for employees and process changes that will help service at FIU move quickly along are among the outcomes that Gunther hopes to achieve through the initiative.

"I think it definitely will help us, there's always room for improvement in all the areas of the university," said Ana Moreyra-Rosado, junior assistant director of admissions, adding also, "If it'd help us do a better job, and help the students in a more efficient manner, then I'm all for it."

Headline: Election to decide future of USPS
Author: David Eugene Rodríguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Employees of the bargaining, operational services, and administrative clerical units of FIU's University Support Personnel System will vote Sept.23 in a collective bargaining election to determine whether they will retain union representation by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees or be represented by the University Board of Trustees.

The election will determine who will negotiate with the university for salaries, wages, benefits, working conditions, promotions.

After the Florida Legislature abolished the Board of Regents two years ago, the board's powers, duties, functions, administrative authority and rules, and existing contracts were transferred to the Florida Board of Education.

In addition, university boards of trustees were created for the state's 11 public universities, including FIU. A Board of Governors was formed to oversee Florida's State University System and the system's individual  boards of trustees, the powers and duties of which are delineated in Florida Statutes. 229.0081.

"All of the autonomy that was essentially held by the Board of Regents was shifted to the Board of Trustees [when it came into effect], so all votes and decisions are made by this body," said Thomas H. Beasley, president of Local 3346 of the AFSCME union. "The FIU administration did not recognize the three-year contract, which is now expired, negotiated between the AFSCME union and the Board of Regents."

Beasley and many USPS employees argue that the  Board of Trustees should not be the only decision maker for the university employees.

"In the past, contracts were negotiated separately, with USPS employees negotiating directly with the Board of Regents, and Career Services employees negotiating directly with the state legislature," Beasley said. "If there was any kind of disagreement or impasse, it would be resolved either in the legislature or by agreement with the Board of Regents."

Beasley and other USPS employees argue that a system in which two parties, USPS and the Board of Trustees, are negotiating but only one has final say over issues is unsuitable. Further, Beasley says  the Board of Trustees is simply a stranger to the workplace.

"You have a body of people that are getting paid more than $100,000 a year and don't have to worry about the same things that the people that are working here have to worry about," Beasley said. "I don't think that they would have any vision, any concept, or understanding of our conditions."

Other USPS employees express similar sentiments about representation with the Board of Trustees.

"Management can do as they please," said Lloyd Austin, an FIU air conditioning mechanic. "They can hire you and fire you without representation. It would be like a communist or dictatorship situation, where people don't have the right to say what they want. It will not be a democracy."

Still, FIU management shares a mutual opinion of the AFSCME union.

In a letter sent to FIU employees at the beginning of the semester, FIU President Modesto Maidique stated that the AFSCME union has not been "as effective" in fostering "productive and respectful working relations" as has the United Faculty of Florida and the Police Benevolent Association.

Beasley disagrees with the president's comments.

"AFSCME has helped USPS employees negotiate wages, benefits and contract language for more than 20 years," Beasley said.

Maidique encourages USPS employees to keep the Board of Trustees at the helm. He noted that in the last several years the university has introduced a number of initiatives in the field of Human Resources. He further expresses a disapproving sentiment towards the AFSCME union, an organization, which according to him, "has not advocated well" for employees.

Maidique later sent another letter to employees eligible to vote to try to answer frequently asked questions about the election. The following message flashed at the bottom of every FAQ page: "Know the facts. Vote no!"

Some union members disagree and are offended by Maidique's action, which they see as a motion from management to influence the vote. 

According to Beasley, an unfair labor practice complaint might be filed in the language of Florida Statute s. 447.501. The statute prohibits public employers from "interfering with, restraining, or coercing public employees in the exercise of any rights guaranteed them under" their contract.

Patricia Telles-Irvin, vice president of Student Affairs and Human Resources, maintains that Maidique has a right to send the letters.

One factor seems to stand out in employees' minds: their annual and sick leaves. Both the administration and the AFSCME union have addressed this in letters written to FIU employees. If not represented by AFSCME, will the employees lose any of their accumulated sick or annual leave?

According to Maidique's statements, this is a benefit that the employees have earned and that will be guaranteed to them. Jeanette D. Wynn, president of the AFSCME Florida Council 79, states that non-union representation might actually combine annual and sick leaves into a single 30-day period for USPS employees.

The Sept. 23 election will be overseen by the Public Employees Relations Commission, the state agency designated to administer Florida's collective bargaining law.

It determines bargaining units, verifies authorization cards, conducts elections for collective bargaining, conducts hearings.

The election will take place in Room 290 of the University Park MARC Building and Room 156 of the Biscayne Bay Campus Library, from 7 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and again from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at both locations.

Subheadline: "Underworld": May influence you to drain your own blood, 2 stars
Author: Krystal Alvarez/ Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Suck on this! As if being a blood-sucking creature of the night wasn't enough, now vamps have to deal with those mean, old, furry lycans (werewolves). Kate Beckensale tells the story of war between the two creepy creatures as the kick-ass vampiress, Selene. 

The movie starts with the classic "Once upon a time..." spiel about how things have changed since she met her lover, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), or as I like to call him, that "Felicity" guy. 

Although the trailer gave the impression the movie was centered on this tormented love affair, the atmosphere is far from Beckensale's romantic "Serendipity" days, focusing instead on underworld conspiracies. 

The opening scene is an all-out battle in a European subway, but the vampires and the werewolves use weapons against each other. What ever happened to good old-fashioned fighting? Instead of getting a  moody vampire flick, I got a warped Steven Seagal movie.

"Underworld" is a two-hour long video game or at least, it should be. Sure, the idea of a war between two scary legends is a good and damn entertaining one, but how far can anyone really stretch that idea without it becoming a long, over-hyped trailer? This is exactly what happened. The movie was a genius marketing machine. 

It sought out the perfect gothic, vampire-loving crowd to market to. The theatre was full of Anne Rice-loving fans that thrive on this sort of dark film. 

It also had moments where the drama was so intense one had to giggle. It seems too dramatic to be a vampire film. It took itself too seriously and it came off as just trying to paste together the perfect bloodsucker flick. 

It was a mixture of "Blade," "The Crow" and "Queen of the Damned," so it's been done. More than that, it has been overdone. 

For fans of this sort of genre, the film may be entertaining and even worth spending money on, but for moviegoers looking to see a deep, innovative vamp film, go rent "Interview with a Vampire" or "Bram Stoker's Dracula." 

Caution: Watching "Underworld" may influence you to drain your own blood.

Headline: TWC offers more than just weather reports
Author: Jonathan Banke/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Few people realize it, but The Weather Channel is currently one of the most watched stations on all of television. 

With a broadcast range of 85 million homes, TWC has become a global phenomenon. In 1982, at its inception, TWC employed only a few dozen people and reached just five million homes. With the growth of satellite and cable television during the 1980s and '90s however, viewership grew exponentially.

Currently, over 300 meteorologists forecast and predict the weather for the millions of people who tune in every day. 

I have to admit, I am a Weather Channel junkie. Without a doubt, the most watched channel in my apartment is TWC. My roommate Tim, believe it or not, is just as bad. 

We not only know the names of the meteorologists, but even some of their tendencies and what times they're on the air. 

Most of the people who come to visit our apartment always think it is a little strange that we'll drop what we are doing just to make sure we do not miss the "Tropical Update." 

Almost all of them have the same question. 

Why?

Well, it all started a little over 11 years ago when Hurricane Andrew rolled through town. That was my first memorable experience with a hurricane. 

Ever since then, I have always been fascinated by tropical systems and the ever-present possibility of one coming through Miami again. 

Growing up, I was, and still am, an avid fisherman, and my hobby was just what I needed to stay hooked on TWC. When I began junior high, I started surfing up in Central Florida on the weekends.

I was following every tropical storm in the ocean, hoping they would come close enough to Florida to give us some good waves, and then soon turn away.  

Little did I know that my future roommate in New Jersey was doing the exact same thing. 

Besides the fact that we can follow every hurricane that comes across the ocean in detail or find out if the weekend is going to be a washout or beach weather, the main reason we watch is for the entertainment value. 

Yes, I said entertainment. 

"You have got to be an absolute idiot to get out in the water today." Not exactly the most welcoming of words to viewers tuned in for their local weather. That's Dave Schwartz, one of the evening meteorologists who comes on during the week. He tells it how it is. 

Another forecaster that has gained fame from the weather is Jim Cantore. Besides being one of, if not the most, recognizable faces on TWC, he also does the weather for "Fox NFL Sunday" broadcasts.

Lastly, "Downtown" Vivian Brown brings a fresh-faced, female point of view to the conditions outdoors.

The best part about TWC, some say, is its consistency. On the hour, every hour, is "Weather Center," a comprehensive look at everything happening around the country. 

At 50 minutes past the hour is "Tropical Update," where storm specialists are called upon to deliver the most accurate of forecasts. 

Along with Cantore, Steve Lyons has found fame from his time on the air, getting up to 300 pieces of fan mail every week. 

Of course, one cannot write about TWC without writing about its staple, "Local on the 8," shown every ten minutes, 24 hours a day. 

As I have been writing this article, there has been live coverage  of Hurricane Isabel as it has been ripping through North Carolina and Virginia. 

A few days ago, Isabel was offshore Florida as a category five hurricane. To put it into perspective as to how strong Isabel was, there is no category six. 

My roommate and I watched as Isabel formed offshore Africa two weeks ago and made its way across the Atlantic Ocean, strengthening into an absolute monster of a storm. 

For several days during the week, Isabel's forecasted track was headed directly towards Miami.

Thankfully for us, she turned north, leaving us with nothing more than some big waves at the beach.Of course, more storms are likely this hurricane season, which ends every year on Nov. 30.

Hopefully, we will be spared the brunt of a big hurricane, but if not, you can be assured that TWC will be there for Miami every step of the way.

Subheadline: "Lost In Translation": All about slight adventures, tiny moments, 3 stars
Author: Chris Newitt/Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
In "Lost in Translation," Bill Murray has the tender fragility of a baby bird.
He even looks like one, with his drawn face, cigarette-skinny legs and round belly. 

And he shares the baby bird's vulnerability and neediness, since he plays a past-his-prime American actor named Bob, making a commercial in Tokyo, where he's jet-lagged, confused and at the mercy of translators who don't tell him everything.

"Lost in Translation" is all about mood, and the mood is Murray's. The film builds on effects he achieved in "Rushmore" and "The Royal Tenenbaums," playing disconnected, melancholy people who associate with livelier types in the hope that their happiness will rub off. 

Here, Bob meets a young woman named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who feels equally adrift and sleep-deprived, and the two of them embark on a series of slight adventures that cheer them both up for a while.

Their outings reach their peak in one of the year's loveliest scenes, when Murray does a raspy, improbably pretty version of the Roxy Music song "More Than This" at a karaoke party. Bob has spent much of the movie in resignation, doing what he's told, but singing breaks him out of his fuzz and tells us this guy used to know what he wanted from life and would like to find a way back there.

"Lost" is made up of tiny moments in that vein. Like Sofia Coppola's previous film, "The Virgin Suicides," "Lost" expertly captures a feeling of woozy bewilderment. There's a shy, tentative quality to her work, which is both distinctive and slightly unsatisfying. 

It's to be admired, for instance, that she steers clear of sentimentality, but her wariness about sentiment makes her skittish about all expressions of emotion.

Coppola is a promising filmmaker, but artists never achieve their potential until they break down their own walls of reserve. It'll be interesting to see what happens if she does that. 

In the meantime, "Lost in Translation" is characterized by Coppola's combination of restraint and fear of commitment, as revealed in the movie's key moment: a whispered declaration from Murray to Johannson that is so quiet, we can't even hear it.

Subheadline: War all the Time: Leaves an awed expression on your face
Author: Melissa-Nicole Grecco/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
One thing about Thursday is still true, they sure have a way with words. 

Every song on their new album, War All the Time, is a tiny poem that just so happens to be accompanied by loud, driving guitars and perfectly executed drumbeats. 

The lyrics stray from the conventional love story motif and instead take a nosedive into topics such as the void of society, human failure and death. 

Even without the words, the music itself seeps in and builds up a feeling of anxiety entangling the listener into the band's own emotions and beliefs.

The album itself is a perfect, natural progression from their last two albums, keeping what worked and scrapping what didn't. The result is a mature album that appeals to a person's need to rock, feel and be socially aware without being preachy or pretentious about it. 

Long-time fans have nothing to fear about Thursday's crossover to major label Island, because the music remains as powerful as ever before. 

No song on this album should be a disappointment. It starts out as potent as it ends and the in-between doesn't deviate much from the structure laid out for it. It is the musical effort people have been craving for a long time. 

Thursday fans will also rejoice in hearing that two Florida dates have been announced for their upcoming tour with Thrice and Coheed and Cambria. These shows will take place on Nov. 12 at Club Ovation in Boynton Beach and Nov. 13 at House of Blues in Orlando.

There are only so many words that can be used to describe an innovative album such as this. The proof itself is evident in the music, its haunting lyrics, and the awed expression it will hopefully leave upon your face.

Subheadline: Heavier Things: Defies the notorious 'sophomore slump'
Author: Lily Percy/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you've had the pleasure of seeing John Mayer live, then you know that he matters more than the hype surrounding him. 

He doesn't really sound like Dave Matthews and, despite the resurgence of talented singer-songwriters, he is one of the few artists right now who doesn't have to worry about the one-hit-wonder curse or how it will affect the length and stability of his career. 

He is that good. 

With his first full-length album, Room for Squares, John Mayer wrote catchy songs like "No Such Thing," "Why Georgia," and every pre-pubescent girl's theme song, "Your Body is a Wonderland." 

The album was lauded as both a critical and commercial success, even garnering a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal for "Your Body is a Wonderland." 

With his new album, Heavier Things, Mayer does what even the great Kevin Smith once failed to do: defy the notorious 'sophomore slump'. 

With songs such as "Clarity," "New Deep," "Home Life" and "Wheel," Mayer somehow manages to breech all of the subjects, questions and ideas that I myself have been contemplating this past year. 

But while this is indeed an album of maturity and growth, it is also a continuation of the jazzy, guitar-based songs so prevalent on Room for Squares. 

Much like his idol Stevie Ray Vaughn, Mayer has the rare ability to be as versatile a guitarist as he is a songwriter and musician. He can go from blues to jazz to pop to rock in the span of a few minutes. 

As anyone who has seen him live over the past few years can attest to, there is nothing more exhilarating than hearing a wailing guitar solo played by someone whose passion and excitement is apparent in every note he plays. 

With Heavier Things, you get the sense that this is just the beginning for John Mayer; that, as trite as it sounds, the best is yet to come. 

Mayer is, after all, only 26 years old, and like all of the music legends who came before him, I believe that his musical journey will mirror our own maturation.

I think that it is rediculios to be passive aggressive and key someones car over something so stupid as a parking space because what comes around goes around and someday you will get what is coming for you if you do so. It is not worth getting into a fight or doing anything to hurt other people when there are so many other parking spaces in this university.  I also believe that who ever comes first should get that space. I strongly, believe in servival of the fitious as well as carma, so next time you think about doing something to someone think aboout it twice because you will get double the prize for what you have done. Life it slef will take care of making sure you pay for what you have done.
