Hello! 

I emailed you about a week ago concerning a story I thought would be of interest to the publication at FIU and wanted to know what you thought, if I could provide any further information, and if I could find out what date you would include it in The Beacon.

Let me know if you would like me to send the story to another writer.

Thanks so much! I look forward to seeing it!

Headline: UP NEXT: Ragin' Cajuns VS Golden Panthers
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
When: Nov. 12 at 6 p.m.
Where: Cajun Field, Laffayette, La.
TV: None
Radio: WKAT 1360 AM, WRGP 88.1 FM 
Record: FIU 2-4 (1-3 SBC), UL 4-5 (3-2 SBC) 

On offense, The Golden Panthers have to continue on the path they set for themselves against Louisiana-Monroe: reduce turnovers. FIU committed only one turnover in their first Division I-A win. Also, the team should see success running the shotgun offense. If they stay on the path, they can get another victory in Louisiana. 

On Defense, FIU will need to stop at least one facet of Louisiana-Laffayette's balanced attack. The Ragin' Cajuns are averaging 238 yards on the ground and 144 yards passing. Forcing turnovers will be key because a missed field goal probably won't give them the victory for a second week in a row.

Headline: Men's soccer splits final home series
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On a weekend in which the men's soccer team celebrated its seven seniors, a group of underclassmen outshined their elders. 

FIU suffered an emotional 3-1 loss to South Carolina on Senior's Night, Nov. 4. The team rebounded Nov. 6 as three players scored their first career goals in a 6-0 victory over East Carolina.

With the win, the Golden Panthers (8-6-2, 4-3-2) clinched the No. 4 seed in the Conference USA Tournament. They were preparing for their Nov. 9 quarterfinal against Marshall as of press time. 

FIU routed Marshall 7-0 Oct. 2, but the Thundering Herd has won five of  its last seven matches including a 1-0 win at South Carolina  Oct. 16.

"It's going to be a really rough game," said forward Judah Hernandez. "They're going to come out really hard because they don't want to be embarrassed 7-0 again."

The winner of FIU vs. Marshall will advance to the semifinals Nov. 11 against the winner of Southern Methodist vs. Tulsa, with the final to be played on Nov. 13. The C-USA tournament is being held in Dallas, Texas.



USC 3, FIU 1



Defensive mistakes hounded the Golden Panthers as South Carolina spoiled Senior's Night with a 3-1 victory.

South Carolina got on the board first in the 11th minute after FIU defender Sheldon Jardine lost control of the ball. USC forward Ayo Akinsete quickly passed it to teammate Josh Alcala, who scored against diving FIU goalkeeper Shawn Crowe.

Several FIU players came close to tying the score in the second half.

Paul Kolovos' laser from 20 yards away during the 78th minute would have reached the net if not for the outstretched fingertips of USC goalkeeper Mike Gustavson.

Less than a minute later, Alcala split the FIU defense and passed off to Ryan Deter who lobbed the ball over Crowe's head for USC's second goal.

FIU rebounded quickly in the 80th minute as Camere juggled the ball on the left side of the net before kicking it in.

"I saw the keeper next to me so I couldn't shoot it," said senior forward Jean Camere. "I tried to take him to the side and make some space and I did."

With time winding down, a pass by Camere was intercepted by USC forward Mike Sambursky, who scored to seal the Gamecocks' victory. 

"We really gifted them three goals and you can't do that against a good team," said head coach Karl Kremser.

USC rounded out C-USA play with a 7-1-1 record, but was outshot 14-8 by the Golden Panthers.

"Tonight was a good measuring stick for us," said senior Chris Megaloudis, "to match up with them and know we can play with them."

A potential FIU/USC rematch in the C-USA tournament is something the Golden Panthers are looking forward to.

"It's the beauty of the sport; there's always a second chance," Camere said. "Always."



FIU 6, ECU 0



Kremser started nine underclassmen in the Golden Panthers' 6-0 win over East Carolina.

"We're gonna have hopefully three games in five days," said senior Lucas Scudeler, "so he wanted everybody to play a little bit so we're ready for the tournament next week."

Junior David Hope got things started by booting a lead pass across the field to sophomore Osmany Hernandez, who scored at 3:08.

In the 18th minute, Hernandez passed off to streaking freshman Juan Guerra. Guerra baited ECU goalkeeper Zachery Roszel out of the box and eased the ball into the net.

Guerra, who celebrated the goal by pulling his jersey over his head, was surprised to earn the start.

"I didn't expect it," he said. "Since the first minute that [coach Kremser] told me, I started getting ready for the game."

FIU converted a corner kick at 31:14 as Megaloudis found Pierre HóSang open in the box. HóSang, a senior defender, kicked the ball in mid-air for the first goal of his FIU career.

"It couldn't come at a better time in the last game of the season here at home," said HóSang. "It feels wonderful."

The goals by Hernandez and Guerra were also the firsts of their respective careers.

Osmany wasn't the only Hernandez to spark FIU. Freshman Judah Hernandez - no relation to Osmany - scored goals with both feet to give FIU a 5-0 lead.

One of four seniors who came off the bench for the final 10 minutes, Carron Williams scored his team-leading eighth goal of the season at 82:20. 

Freshman goalkeeper Kyle Thomas earned his second shutout of the season as FIU's young stars shined brightly, showing a glimpse of good things to come.

"This is going to be the team next year so hopefully we'll do well," Guerra said. "But first we've got the conference this week, and then we'll look forward to next year."

With a spot in the NCAA Championships on the line, FIU will be playing to extend their season at the C-USA tournament.

"It's going to be very difficult but that's why you play, to get into the NCAAs," Kremser said. "If we can do that in this conference, it should bode well for us in the NCAA tournament."

Headline: BIG TIME VICTORY
Subheadline: Late missed field goal grants football its first Division I-A, SBC victory
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The snap was perfect, as was the hold but the kick was not. Ragan Walters 35-yard attempt  with 12 seconds left sailed inches wide to the right and handed FIU its first ever win against a Division I-A opponent. 

The Golden Panthers (2-5, 1-3 SBC) beat the host Louisiana-Monroe (3-5, 3-1 SBC) 31-29  Nov. 5 in Monroe, La. in front of 10,111 devastated fans. 

"This was a great win," said head coach Don Stock following his team's first Sun Belt Conference win. "Anytime you win on the road, against a conference opponent, it's a big win. I'm happy for the players. They went through a tough week last week, with Hurricane Wilma. Some still don't have electricity. I'm proud of the way we played."

Although the Indians controlled the clock, running 20 more plays than the visiting Golden Panthers, big plays on both special teams and defense - as well as three touchdown passes from senior quarterback Josh Padrick - made the difference. 

Padrick finished the day 21-for-35, passing for 235 yards and three scores; he was also the   leading rusher for the Golden Panthers with 38 yards on seven carries. 

FIU came out with shotgun formation on offense in the second half,  taking the Indians by surprise. 

"We changed things up a bit [in the second half]," Strock said. "It worked out pretty much the way we hoped it would. We went into the shotgun and spread it out with four wide receivers and that caused them some problems. We scored a couple of quick touchdowns and got ourselves really ahead in the game." 

In the opening drive of the game, Indian's quarterback Steven Jyles, who finished the day 32-for-49 with 384 yards passing, as well as 51 yards rushing on nine carries and three total touchdowns, marched the hosts down the field with a 13 play, 80 yard drive that ran almost six minutes off the clock. 

Tailback Calvin Dawson capped off the drive with a three-yard touchdown run that put the conference leaders up 6-0. On the ensuing extra point however, linebacker Keyonvis Bouie, who led the defense with 19 total tackles, got a hand on the extra point attempt that bounced wide. 

Little did he know, that play would change the rest of the game. 

On the ensuing possession, Padrick walked FIU down the field in a similar 80-yard drive that was capped off by a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide out Cory McKinney, putting his team up 7-6.  

Padrick was very pleased with his team's performance especially after taking 10 days off because of Hurricane Wilma. 

"I think the week off for the hurricane really paid off for us," Padrick said. "It gave us a little break and we came out tonight energized. This win took a lot of hard work and we all played our hearts out. 

"We adopted a new attitude this week - believe and conquer. That's what it took late in this ball game. We never quit believing and we got the win."

The defense held the Indians in check throughout the first half, led in part by three takeaways - including Nick Turnbull's 73-yard fumble return for a touchdown, which gave FIU an eight point lead. 

Following a Walters field goal with 23 seconds left in the first half, FIU went into the locker room with its second lead in as many games. 

A wild second half that saw Monroe outscored FIU 20-17, began with Adam Moss connecting on yet another field goal, his ninth in 10 tries this season; the senior nailed a 39-yard attempt on the opening drive of the half that put the underdogs up 17-9. 

The Golden Panthers would then extend their lead to 15 following a 22-yard touchdown pass from Padrick to Chandler Williams, which was set up by an interception by defensive back Chris Smith two plays earlier. 

With FIU holding a 24-9 with 5:47 left in the third quarter, the Indians came alive thanks to fantastic play from Jyles. Once again, he rolled the hosts down the field on an 80-yard drive, this time through eight plays, punching the ball in himself from one yard out. Following  Walters' chip shot, they trailed 24-16. 

Jyles continued his superb play when he connected with 6'6", 215 lbs. wide out Drouzon Quillen from 30 yards out, on the first play of the fourth. The touchdown, which came after a Julius Eppinger fumble, brought the Indians within striking distance at 24-22, after a failed two-point conversion.

As the lead evaporated before his eyes, Padrick executed a six-play, 58-yard drive on the ensuing possession that culminated in his season-high third touchdown pass of the game, giving FIU a 31-22 lead.

Eppinger made up for committing FIU's only turnover of the game by catching the Padrick pass, which came on the same play that gave them a touchdown at Troy two weeks before. 

At no point did Jyles quit. 

On the ensuing possession, three plays following a 56-yard kickoff return by Kevin Payne, Jyles had his second rushing touchdown of the day to once again bring his team within two, this time at 31-29.

The rest of the fourth quarter was a series of time - consuming drives by the Golden Panther offense that culminated in the Indians getting the ball back at their own 36-yard line with 2:06 left to play. Following a successful drive that saw them stomp into FIU territory and set up a field goal with 12 seconds left, the rest is history. 

Walters set up from 35-yards out on third-and-10 and missed just inches to the right. Indian fans held their heads in the hands as they saw their perfect conference record disappear before their eyes. 

Following two conference losses that saw SBC newcomer FIU lose by a combined eight points, defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Bernard Clark portrayed what all the FIU family was feeling as he bumped chests with one of his players during the post-game celebrations.

FIU, looking for another upset win, will travel back to Louisiana Nov. 12 to face 4-5 (3-2 SBC) Louisiana-Lafayette at 7 p.m., before coming back to Miami to close out it's season with a three-game home stand.

Headline: Christianity and conservatism: Are they mutually exclusive?
Author: Cristela Guerra  / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Are all Christians conservative? Are all Conservatives Christian?  These questions have been discussed throughout the controversy of whether or not right-wing conservatives, who support Bush, use the basis of religion as a standard for running this country. 

Though it seems I am about to bash the entire establishment for ruining our country and our economy, part of me can't - because I'm Christian. I'm upset and torn by the stereotype that's waging both a figurative and a literal war on every mind in the nation.  

According to CNN.com, 78 percent of the white male, evangelical and born again Christian's vote went to the Bush/Cheney campaign.  I saw this happening first hand within my church and church community as well as on campus through ministry groups and students supporting the Republican Party.  

The reason why most of them were supporting Bush seemed fairly clear; Bush was the Christian president promoting Christian ideals and morals, John Kerry was a flip-flopper.  More often than not, I heard the same lingo heard on "Fox News" and "The 700's Club."  

There were those Republicans who were based on the issues and supported their party, because they held themselves to what they believed was best for the country, politically. But many faith-driven individuals decided to look at just the faith aspect.

During this time of controversy and chaos when our nation was searching for the best possible candidate to be our next president, it became easier for most to just stereotype and place all Christians in the same basket.

 There was no focus on good aspects of morality and what Christian values bring to the home. Instead, there was a shift to the fire and brimstone preaching that was the language of the Puritans so long ago.  

Once religion was brought to the government, politics sullied even the purest of its ideals. Christians were associated, not with bringing the good news of forgiveness and change, but instead were given a sword and shield, and decided we had the God-given right to attack another nation even if the reasons were not supported by the majority of the world. 

As a Christian, I'm tired of church leaders going up to the pulpit and giving Christians a bad reputation. Yes, my faith decides many parts of my life for me and I place things before God to motivate me and help me accomplish my goals.   

However, there is truth and grace that the Bible brings that is not reflected in the way these people are acting or what they stand and live by.  I am not fully conservative, but I'm also not fully liberal. I consider myself a moderate and I stand by my morals on certain issues, but it's beyond me to think that the president can use his faith to validate this never-ending war.  

Freshman Roberto Flores, who is majoring in international business agrees.

"To be Conservative doesn't mean it is necessary to be Christian because Christian values come from the home and not always straight from the church.  These ideas can be skewed, for example my parents are conservative as in certain traditions, but still very liberal. I was instilled these values not only by them, but also by society and those who I have associated myself with. In Mexico, conservative Catholics are very prominent; so some people might choose to not necessarily be seen as too liberal if they don't want to get in trouble with certain people," Flores said.

In a country such as ours where not all people are Christian, not all people have families and not all people are straight, there is a multitude of differences that need to be taken into account before one makes choices that decide our faith as a nation. 

I believe that the president does not take this into consideration as much as he should.  He has the right, like any other individual, to practice the faith that he chooses, but good judgment has to be shown through taking action, as well as giving the people options.  I believe morality and values ultimately root this country and have given us the foundation for what we need to continue working and succeeding.  I also believe separation of church and state was put in effect for a reason.  

Perhaps to some, this is hypocrisy on my part, but it is no more hypocritical than the goals the president set for himself after declaring war on Iraq four and a half years ago and look where we are now.

It's ridiculous to believe that just because one is a Christian, one must be a stringent Bush-supporter. My faith doesn't allow that.

Headline: Study days axed, Fall semester extended due to Wilma
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While Hurricane Wilma robbed South Floridians and the University-wide community  of property, electricity and orderly traffic, the Category 3 storm that created chaos in much of Miami-Dade County may now steal something else from FIU students - study time.

Provost Mark Rosenberg announced that the Fall 2005 semester would be extended to Dec. 17, in order to compensate for the days lost in the wake of  Wilma. In an e-mail sent to university faculty, Rosenberg stated that "programmatic integrity" made the extension necessary. The decision effectively eliminates the "study days" of Dec. 9 and 10 and finals week  scheduled for Dec. 12-17.

The adjusted academic calendar now calls for professors to conduct classes during the week starting Dec. 12 and to administer final exams on the last day of class. Each professor has the responsibility of informing students about specific changes to course content, class meetings, and their new scheduled date of exams. 

Rosenberg urges faculty members to be compassionate with students during this time of difficulty. In the e-mail, he implores professors to "be sensitive to the fact that many of their students are likely to have multiple exams on the same day, as there will likely be little possibility of staggering students' exams in the manner allowed by a designated week devoted to exams."

History professor Frank Marotti is concerned about students handling the extra workload and has already decided to follow Rosenberg's call for sensitivity.

"If a student has a certain schedule, they may suddenly have two or three exams on one day," said Marotti. "My grading system places less emphasis on the final, but what worries me are the people who stress exams. A lot of things can go wrong."

Alex Brevil, a junior studying biological services and chemistry, said some professors have not been so responsive to student concerns. 

"I am totally against [extending the semester]," Brevil proclaimed once he learned of the decision. "I have three difficult exams on the same day. Now I have one day to study for an entire semester and we only have an hour-and-fifteen minutes to finish each exam."

Study Days traditionally gave students a short break from classes before finals - a godsend to those who need to review topics examined over the entire semester. 

The reshuffling of the academic calendar will do away with the coveted days of review, which may increase the difficulty of final exams.

Still, not all students share Brevil's disappointment. Senior Vanessa Estrada is in full support of the decision to add extra class sessions. 

"I think it was necessary," said Estrada. "We lost a week of school, so how else would we make it up? I never used the study days anyway. My only concern is graduation." 

The 2005 graduation ceremonies to be held on Dec. 19 and 20 will go on as planned, although faculty members have until Dec. 22 to submit grades.

Headline: Wilma blamed for construction delay
Subheadline: Only marine biology building on schedule
Author: Chester Robards / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although most construction at Biscayne Bay Campus is behind schedule because of Hurricane Wilma, nothing is standing in the way of completing the marine biology building, according to vice provost Raul Moncarz and Chris Brown, director of the marine biology program. 

Both agree that the building is right on schedule.

Though the infrastructure is almost complete there is still some interior work to be done. 

"Labs have been installed, some equipment has been ordered, but is not in place," Brown said.

Workers are also in the process of installing a salt water system inside the building, and the settling pond east of the building will be used as the reservoir servicing the system, according to Brown.

The academic needs of the new marine biology building are also being taken into consideration. 

"We are getting the best possible faculty," Moncarz said. 

A date has not been set for the official opening of the building, yet Moncarz estimates that the building will open in January 2006.

"We will move students and faculty in as soon as we can," Brown said

Brown has been highly praised by administrators for successfully increasing the number of students enrolled in Marine Biology. 

According to the marine biology website, enrollment was in the low teens when the program was first of the implementation of the program. 

Now, there are 106 students enrolled, according to Valerie E. Hall, the marine biology secretary. 

Another construction site without an opening date is the Wolfe University Center expansion, and it is lagging in progress.

"The WUC has been approved," Moncarz said. "The question now is "when?"

The expansion has been underway for two years, but the site is still in the works.

"There is no information on when the construction in the WUC will begin again,"  said Gregory Olson, senior director of Student Affairs. 

However, there is information on why the expansion has been delayed.

"What has been a problem with the WUC expansion has been the plumbing, funding and now the hurricane," Moncarz said.

But, the money to begin construction again was taken out of vendor profits from the bookstore and food service.When construction stopped, the Fitness Center was being moved from the third to the first floor of the WUC, adjacent to the pool. 

The cafeteria was also being relocated from the second floor to the area across from Panther Print and Mail on the first floor.

Now, the damage from Hurricane Wilma is causing FIU to fall two to three weeks behind schedule, according to Moncarz.

"We were moving, but we had an emergency and now I'm trying to redirect things back to the expansion," Moncarz said. 

The cafeteria was scheduled to open during the Spring semester of this year, but has also been postponed.

These construction delays have prolonged the restricted access to areas of the campus behind the WUC. 

Of the two doors with access to the outside facing the hospitality management building, the one closest to the pool has been closed occasionally because of construction. However, some students have grown accustomed to the white dust and restriction signs guiding students through another path. 

"I didn't even know why it was blocked off, I was just directed to another door on my way to the hospitality management building," said Shaundica Johnson, a graduate student in the hospitality management department.

Another student, Andrew Saba, agreed.

"It hasn't bothered me one bit," said junior Saba, who is majoring in business management, said.

Headline: Shopgirl offers a new spin on dating
Author: Frances Perez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Shopgirl, based on Steve Martin's bestselling novella, is a contemporary romance about an unsuspecting girl searching for something to snatch her from everyday life. Set in the sunny streets of Los Angeles, Martin offers a clever story about the delightful and equally troubling aspects of dating.

Claire Danes plays Mirabelle Buttersfield, a blasé retail worker in the glove department of Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. 

Originally from a simple town in Vermont, she slumps behind the counter and routinely drives home to feed her cat; all while struggling to pay off her student loans. The life she leads is average; yet her blank eyes clearly long for some excitement. 

At a routine laundry stop, she meets Jeremy, a stencil artist for a sound equipment company, played by Jason Schwartzman. This corky, sarcastic loner seems unable to stimulate Mirabelle's desires, especially when he plainly asks her for money to wash his clothes. 

Yet, he openly declares himself "a good guy." His sense of humor is almost intrusive and unnerving because he never hesitates to express his thoughts. 

The film also stars Martin as Ray Porter, an obscure and successful man with a warm, charming confidence. This 50-some casanova deftly entices Mirabelle with nurturing companionship. 

It appears as though he fell from the sky when he suddenly pops up in the store looking to buy a pair of gloves. 

The initial encounter is random and brief; but he considers her opinion and buys the gloves she recommends. She is immediately taken by him and agrees to a date, though his emotion for her appears reserved. 

In the time period of one year, the lives of these three individuals carry on simultaneously and each seems to reach a level of personal growth. The question is: Who will eventually stay with Mirabelle?

Since her poignant, coming- of-age role in My So Called Life, Daines has never failed to impress with her gripping display of emotion and subtle beauty. She is most known for her role as Beth in Gillian Armstrong's Little Women, and as Juliet from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in Baz Luhrman's adaptation. From Romeo's addiction to retail associate, this girl-next-door will single-handedly steal your heart.

Jason Schwartzman is relatively new to the movie scene. He performed opposite Bill Murray in his debut comedy, Rushmore; earning him a nomination for "Most Promising Actor" from the Chicago Film Critics Association. 

Not long ago, he dropped the lead drummer slot for the Los Angeles band, Phantom Planet. His diversity undeniably influences his cutting-edge style. 

The dialogue in the film is fairly simple and most of the interpretation throughout the scenes is left to the viewer. 

The music is elegantly instrumental and is not included in the kissing scenes; adding a sensible touch to the usual features of a Hollywood movie. 

Shopgirl is a first class breakaway from Martin's usual comedic projects like Bringing Down the House and Cheaper by the Dozen; where he normally plays the role of loving father. Most can relate to loving someone even when it's not the perfect circumstances or finding your soul mate in the most unlikely person. Undoubtedly, Martin presents a witty and sincere account of modern day relationships that is sure to thrill moviegoers everywhere. 

This fresh, fall romance is perfect for a date or a girls' night out.

Headline: Queen of pop returns to the dance floor
Author: Bobby Joe Bracy / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"I want people to jump out of their seats," Madonna said on her official website of the highly-anticipated comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor ... and she's not kidding. 

  The "material girl" has built her career on definitive pop music, iconic performances and an unapologetic relationship with controversy. There's a lot of hype surrounding her latest musical endeavor.  

If you haven't already noticed, Madonna is on a media blitz with her show-stealing performance on the European MTV Awards, the controversy with Rabbis shunning her album and the release of her stomping, thumping, ABBA-sampling disco anthem "Hung Up," the first single off the album. The look is instantly noticeable: The Charlie's Angels hair, the glittering spike heels and an obsession with the disco ball.

But does she deliver?

Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna's strongest work since Ray of Light, is supposed to get Madonna back on top with a return to her roots: The throbbing halls of the club scene. 

Each track on the album resonates with the attitude, confidence and euphoria of a thrashing dance floor. 

Influences from disco, electro-clash, trance and Euro-house/techno all whip around in the tracks - tracks that seamlessly blend into the next in a DJ set-like mix; it plays from start to finish as a non-stop dance throw down.  

"Hung Up" kicks off the speakers for Confessions: As the bass-line stutters beneath a soaring sample of ABBA's "Gimme Gimme Gimme," Madonna sings: "Every little thing that you say or do/ I'm hung up! / I'm hung up on you." It's instantly clear what she's going for on this album. 

The songs are all ambitious in their attempt to get you to dance, and although the lyrical depth isn't exactly Shakespeare, the attitude is what wins over the album.  Madonna certainly delivers it in the track "Sorry," in which she thrashes with catchy beats and sings, "You're not half the man you think you are/ Save your lies 'cause you've gone too far."  

Anyone who has ever been lied to by a man is going to love this track when it plays at the club.  It makes interesting use of the vocoder-effect as Madonna chants: "I've heard it all before" and "I'm sorry" echoes underneath in several different languages.	Madonna left no room for ballads here, there's no mistake about that. With every beat and thud of the album, Madonna stomps back. 

Although not all the songs on the album are going to be instant smashes, there's no weak track. It's not that you would want to stop and skip a track, but some songs  pulse slightly off to the side - they aren't blatant dance anthems; instead they server as catchy hypnotic trance-like tracks, leaving the spotlight to the real dance hits. 

"Future Lovers," for example, shimmers in, out, up and down with a sample from Blue Man Group's "I Feel Love."  It is not as bold as the previous track, "Sorry," but it's a good song that allows you to get down as the jagged electric guitar strings of the electro-clash dance anthem "I Love New York" takes you by surprise.  

The latter is ripe to be turned into a drag-queen anthem; Madonna uses that trademark pop-diva sass as she shouts, "Get off'a mah street! / Get off'a mah street!"  

Though never one to shy away from controversy, Madonna has had to defend her album from Rabbis crying blasphemy. "Isaac" is a song rumored to be about the 16th century Jewish philosopher Isaac Luria; it is considered taboo to use his name for profit.  

The song, however, is named after the man who sings the Hebrew chants that echo in the chorus. Confessions has its flaws; there's a lack of timelessness in her songs when compared to classics such as "Into the Groove." It is primal, instinctual and relies on the raw energy of dance floor and Madonna's delivery and for her, that's a good thing; it's her biggest strength.  

Many different aspects of music can be found on this album, (even a disco take of reggaeton can be found in "Push") and the album defintately avoids the sin of being tedious. After the sultry, swaying beats of the last track "Like it or Not," she winds down with a single guitar strumming until it fades.  

It may seem a little off to suddenly go out so quietly because after all is said and done, shouldn't it go out with a bang?  Did Madonna deliver?

Yes, rest assured ladies and gents. She's back.

Subheadline: Jazz legend Arturo Sandoval performs with students
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Arturo Sandoval's name is a well-known one in my family. Like Sandoval, my father left Cuba in 1967, fleeing the communism brought by Fidel Castro. Because of this, Sandoval's life story in the movie, For Love or Country - in which his musical freedom is gradually taken - is especially meaningful to him, and he often claims that every second-generation Cuban should see it.

Although I often tease my father  ("Yes Dad, I know, everything in Cuba was perfect until Fidel came ..."), I do realize that leaving Cuba is a huge part of who he will always be, and as a result, also a part of who I am today. For this reason, going with him to see Sandoval's jazz concert  at FIU, Nov. 4, was a special treat for the both of us. 

A trumpet teacher at FIU for the last 15 years, three-time Grammy winner. Sandoval has also given workshops at universities all across the U.S., Europe and South America. 

The Wertheim Performing Arts Center was full that night, with even President Modesto Maidique in attendance. A surprise awaited the audience, Sandoval would be backed not only by the FIU Big Band led by Sam Lussier, but also by his famous touring band, including a drummer, bassist, pianist and conga player. 

As Sandoval welcomed the audience, one man in the crowd congratulated him on his upcoming Nov. 6 birthday. He responded, jokingly, that he didn't want to be reminded of his birthday and didn't want to get any older, but as soon as he started playing, the energy and skill he showed through his instruments did not seem to be those of a man getting any older.

As Sandoval drummed, his drumsticks flew almost quicker than I could follow, and as he played the instrument for which he is best known, the trumpet, where he hit extremely high notes that pierced the entire auditorium. 

During his climactic solos, all the other musicians would freeze and watch him closely, taking in his talent and waiting for their next cue to join him.

One of the highlights of the concert was the piano/maraca duet, played by Sandoval and his conga player, respectively. On this third instrument, Sandoval again displayed his expertise. He leaned into the piano, as he played gently coaxing the music from it, and making it look deceivingly easy in the process.

Throughout the concert, Sandoval encouraged and guided the students in the Big Band, suddenly asking them to step forward and play solos. Following their solos, he would applaud them and even give them high fives. It was clear that the students respected this great musician and were grateful for the chance to play with him.

I imagine it must have been partly this determination, and focus on what he loves to do, that got him, and his, family safely here from Cuba. My dad and I came away from the concert with the idea that Arturo Sandoval is a lot like jazz music: informal, spontaneous and unpretentious.
