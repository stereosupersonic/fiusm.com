Headline: Question Time: My, How The Tables Have Turned
Author: By Hans and Jackie / Staff Columnists
&nbsp;
This week, Hans and Jackie decided it'd be fun to give their more reliable troublemakers (a.k.a. questioners) a chance to answer questions. So this week, Hans will be asking them questions and next week, Jackie will be piquing into their minds.

H: Curious Moron, suppose that curiosity did not kill the cat... What would have done the job?

A: The steps to killing a cat.: 1) Take a large metal rod and pound on its head. Not to hard, as to prevent cranial splattering. Wait until its comatose. 2) Hang it by it's tail over a basinet and drain the blood by a smooth narrow slit above the neck. 3) Have a smoke or coffee break. 4) Dice the cat into small cubes and place these cubes in a Ziplok freezer bag. Cubing the meat makes it last longer and makes it easy to mix with pasta for a quick meal. Serves 2 -4 (depending on the size of the cat). (For high-altitudes, preheat to 350 and listen to John Denver's Greatest Hits.)
Curious Moron

H: Why do women have two breasts when they're so much more likely to have one child, instead of two (or three or four?) Who is supposed to use the extra breast?

A: The extra breast is just a back-up for when the pipes get clogged. Anyway, think about how one breast would look like spread across a woman's chest: like the Mercurys of the early 90's with one wide headlight.  Just wrong. Plus, it's not always about the breasts themselves; sometimes it's about the space between.  Just like the legs.  Next Question Time: I'll tell you what a 'pearl necklace' is.
Handy Man

H: All right, Xander Von Rook: If you had to kill a Buffy character, who would you kill, and how?

A: It would be a hard decision. In order to clear the path for a Buffy/Xander relationship, I'd have to off Spike, that brit vampire with a leather fetish. Though I do think his peroxide wit and evil personality add a lot to the show, my greater concern is uniting Buffy and Xander. Then the show can end.
Xander Von Rook

H: Candle, sometimes there are moments in life where telling the truth is vital. That said, why are there little white lies? Isn't that an awfully racist saying?

A: I have one question for you, Hans &#8211; where the hell did all the Indians go? The whiteys lied to them! Maybe that's why they call them little white lies.
Candle

H: Guru, is there a good way of keeping sex a clean, fun, family friendly acitivity?

A: The Guru say:
sex and friendly fun
only time holds secret of
sexy lesbian

Headline: In Our View:The Beacon recommends candidates for SGA elections
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Every April, to coincide with the SGA Elections, The Beacon releases a list of candidate recommendations. These are based on applications the editorial board provided to each of the eligible candidates running for office on both university campuses. Upon completing the applications, the candidates were interviewed by a select number of editors, while candidates for representative at large and the presidential tickets were interviewed by the entire editorial board. Candidates that did not complete the initial applications were stricken from consideration. 



University Park:



President and Vice-President: 



The Beacon recommends Armando Rodriguez and Maria Garcia



Number of tickets: 2

Candidates: Jessica Morffi and Omar Castillo; Armando Rodriguez and Maria Garcia



At first glance, both presidential tickets seem eerily similar. Two former representatives at large paired with other council members. Both have experience on various university committees and have served in numerous clubs and honor societies. Both campaigns have clear goals and detailed plans if elected. The main difference lies in what issues the tickets see as important to students. Rodriguez and Garcia have bypassed the often-repeated "visibility" and "school spirit" issues that have littered SGA campaigns for the past years. In their place they've put together a list of concrete issues that can have definite results. 

If there's one thing that affects all students, even the disaffected commuters that don't partake in any student activities, it's money. Rodriguez and Garcia's main goal is cutting costs for students where it's feasible and increasing student options. How many times have you been short on cash but couldn't use your credit card on campus for food? Rodriguez and Garcia hope to move toward having credit cards accepted in the university, along with removing ATM surcharges from university machines. In addition to the above, Rodriguez and Garcia are looking to provide students with free legal advice in conjunction with the new FIU College of Law. The details of how the Morfi/Castillo ticket's goals of keeping students informed via email and pushing for an increase in school spirit remained a bit vague. More students will benefit from the goals outlined by the Rodriguez/Garcia ticket. 



For Representative at Large (Three candidates elected):



Candidates: Jaimie Eson, Marlon Font, Max Gauthier, Jorge Rosario, Clayton Solomon and Bill Wilson



Having to choose between six candidates for the representative at large position at University Park's Student Government Council was quite difficult this year. Of the six that are running for office, five have at least one year of student government experience. Marlon Font has spent the past two semesters serving student government as the academic affairs chair where he effectively lobbied for the university to create a cooling off period. This would give students a break between the last day of class and the first day of finals week so they would have more time to study. Marlon also helped to write the first Honors Code at the university and helped organize FIU Day in Tallahassee as part of his duties as the president of the Student Alumni Association. Once elected into office, Font plans on trying to lower any future tuition increases, preventing any new student fees from being approved and promote the university's services to commuter students. Font already has connections with the Board of Trustees and with Gov. Jeb Bush so he would have a greater chance of achieving budget equity for the university. 

Clayton Solomon spent the past year as student government's Student Union chair, where he successfully expanded the Graham Center's recycling programs by ordering more recycling bins for GC offices and for student – populated areas. Solomon also tried to lower ATM fees at the University Credit Union. Once elected into office, he would like to work with the Biscayne Bay SGC to create a student government community service project and fundraiser. He also has plans on improving current SGC events such as SGA Week and FIU Day at the Capitol. He also plans on fighting against further budget cuts. 

Bill Wilson spent this year working for the Student Programming Council and advising SGC as to what the group is planning on accomplishing and what they have already done. Wilson has plans to find out what students need through a "Pit Stop," a monthly meeting with students and other representatives at the GC Pit and through student support and feedback meetings.



The Beacon recommends: Marlon Font, Clayton Solomon and Bill Wilson



For Lower Division Representatives (Two candidates elected):



Candidates: Sergio Balsinde, Jessica Franchi-Alfaro, Simon Pineres, Jacqueline Sosa and Reinaldo Villa.



Although the pool of candidates running for  lower division candidates was rather large, some of the more qualified candidates seemed to stand out most. Jessica Franchi-Alfaro spent the past year serving as a student government intern for SGC's student services department. As an intern, Franchi-Alfaro spent her time planning student oriented projects and SGC's campus safety tour. 

She plans on having an open forum so the students she represnets will have better access to her and to have publications and e-mails to let her constituents know of the programs student government is working on. She also plans on targeting lower division students at freshman experience classes and getting to know what they want and expect from student government. Jacqueline Sosa also spent the past year as an intern. Her duties included researching, writing e-mails and representing SGC Presidnt Victor Romano at campus meetings. Sosa plans on visiting freshman experience classes and working to make surveys so she can get to know which issues and concerns her constituents feel are important.



The Beacon recommends: Jessica Franchi-Alfaro and Jacqueline Sosa



For College of Business Representative::



Candidates: Senen Garcia and Samir Qureshi



Every year, there seems to be a down period for new representatives early in their term. Learning the intricacies of parliamentary procedure, writing resolutions and the ilk. In positions of student leadership, experience is essential. While Garcia does indeed have connections with many of the business clubs and organizations, Qureshi holds two definite advantages that in the end will benefit students: He already has a semester of experience and will be able to serve a full term as a representative, which Garcia cannot match. Because of graduation, Garcia would have to leave his post in the middle of the year if elected, which would disrupt council continuity and not benefit the students. Qureshi's experience and knowledge of the council, combined with his years in various university-wide organizations makes him overly qualified for the post of business representative.



The Beacon recommends: Samir Qureshi



For Honors College Representative:



Candidates: Arianne Britt and Damion Dunn



Arianne Britt already has experience with the Honors College, having served this past year as the Honors College Society President and the Honors College Student Advisory Council Secretary. It is Britt's intimate knowledge of the college that makes her stand out in the editorial board's collective mind. Britt has plans to expand the Honors College convocation by showing the projects honors College students have completed. 

She also has plans to increase activities taking place at the Honors Place at Panther Hall. Britt wants to increase National Collegiate Honors Council Conference involvement to help raise FIU's prestige.



The Beacon recommends: Arianne Britt



BBC:



Because all but two of the positions up for election at the Biscayne Bay Campus are not contested, only one application was received from a candidate. This is not a slight on the candidates running. 

Obviously, if you're unopposed, why bother filling out an application vying for recommendation when the election is in the bag? Our gripe is with the student leaders and students who have chosen not to participate in the election process. If you don't vote or participate, don't complain.



Lower Division Representative:



The Beacon recomends: Mfonobong Essiet.



The following candidates did not return their questionnaire or appear at a scheduled interview.



College of Arts and Sciences: Steve Ramirez (no recommendation)



College of Education: Christine Carbot



College of Engineering: Adrian Arbide, Luis Martinez and Shusheng Ye (no reccomendation)



Graduate Students: Salman Azhar  (no recommendation)



Honors College: Damion Dunn (no recommendation)



Housing: Kimberly Skiffington (no recommendation)



Lower Division: Simon Pineres (no recommendation)

Headline: Point-Counterpoint: War on Drugs
Subheadline: U.S. wages losing battle on drugs
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
The war on drugs has come into focus once again due to the government's latest desperate anti-drug campaign focusing on terrorism's connection to drugs. 

While there may be some truth to the involvement of terrorists and drugs, they have an even bigger involvement with guns. 

Why is it that nobody in the government is calling for Smith & Wesson to stop making guns? 

They would have you believe that by using drugs, you are directly funding terrorist attacks. The truth is that the government could probably find a correlation between terrorists and anything. 

However, the most laughable aspect of America's war on drugs is its selective choices of which drugs it ignores. Government officials and lay persons commonly acknowledge that alcohol and nicotine are drugs. Meanwhile, as they are making these empty admissions, millions are dying because of their effects. 

Why is it that the government does not prohibit the usage of these drugs, which in many cases have fatal consequences? 

The reason is that by doing so, they would upset many of their campaign contributors, while costing some their jobs. The loss of American jobs is of course an unwelcome prospect. However, it does seem that this would be a more favorable option than allowing thousands of people to die every day. 

Also, alcohol has been linked to violence time and time again. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, over 40 percent of convicted murderers counted alcohol as a factor in their crimes. 

On the other hand, a National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse found that marijuana actually inhibits the expression of aggressive behavior. 

Think about it, how many domestic violence cases involve marijuana-users? Most of the time, domestic violence would require entirely too much energy.   

Make no mistake; I do not believe that drugs should be legalized across the board. Drugs like heroin and cocaine can be extremely dangerous and detrimental to societies, especially those that are impoverished. 

However, as has become evident over the past few years, our government is losing the war on drugs, and it is as much our own fault as it is our leader's.

The problem is that the "drugs are evil" mentality has been drilled into our heads for so long. Thus, the American people have a stigma about them, even if it is discovered that they can have positive effects, such as marijuana for medicinal purposes. A few years back, Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders proposed the drug's legalization, and was all but laughed out of Washington. 

The truth is, we know that we should legalize marijuana. It has worked in countries such as the Netherlands, where it has been legal for years. 

There have been numerous statements made, ranging from DEA personnel, to the British government, to the World Health Organization that marijuana should be decriminalized. 

Countless medical agencies have denounced the "Gateway Drug" theory. However, because we think that drugs are bad, we are unwilling to even listen to any arguments to the contrary. 

Regardless of how you feel about its legalization, most can agree on the severity of punishment for drug offenders being far too extreme. In 1999, drug offenders made up 61 percent of state prison population. 

Every few years, many prisons release some inmates early due to overcrowding. Many times, this sets free violent criminals, while minor drug offenders remain locked up. This is because of harsh mandatory sentences for those convicted of drug usage. 

In some cases, those convicted of using marijuana for recreational purposes have gone to jail for twenty years. 

Twenty years in jail for using weed? The fact is, politicians often push for such legislation simply so they can tell us that they are "tough on drugs." 

It is time we wise up. The legalization of marijuana is something that should be given real consideration in America. 

It has been proven to work, and it is unfair to send thousands of people to jail for years on end, just for minor drug offenses. 

It is equally unfair to the American public to continually spend billions of its dollars on a war that we are losing, and many would argue, have already lost.

Headline: Point-Counterpoint: War on Drugs
Subheadline: War on drugs battle worth fighting
Author: David Pulgar
&nbsp;
It's a Friday night, and a man, seeking a bit of relaxation, casually walks into the corner drug store for a pack of cigarettes. He glances at the variety of options tobacco companies have given him but chooses to go for something more daring. "Gimme a pack of weed," says the man. That's right, he's going to buy marijuana. The man walks out of the store, gets into his car, lights a joint and begins to drive home. Halfway there, he never sees the group of children crossing the street nor does he notice when he hits them. 

No, this horrible situation isn't real, but it could be if those in favor of legalizing drugs get their way. Yes, heroin, PCP, cocaine, pot, and a myriad of other narcotics could be purchased over the counter at any store. 

Wouldn't it be great if people could get their hands on some downers to help them get through a long day? Oh, and wouldn't children function better if they took some steroids to enhance their performance in Physical Education? 

If I'm sounding a bit too sarcastic I apologize, because I cannot even begin to fathom how someone could ever consider legalizing drugs. Legalized drugs would tear apart the moral fiber of our society and send our country into a downward spiral towards oblivion. Proponents of legalizing drugs say we're spending too much money on anti-drug forces. Oh yeah, lets help the situation by making drugs legal, increasing the price of health care and medical insurance which will lead to higher taxes. 

Here's another question: If drugs are legalized who's going to supply them? Will pharmaceutical companies sell us addictive drugs, only to then sell us drugs that can keep us alive so we can keep using, to then sell us methadone to help us quit using the drugs? Heck, why not sell us a coffin too? Whose wallet are they trying to help? Certainly not mine.

Another argument for drug legalization is medicinal value. False claims have been made that marijuana and similar substances can help ease the pain of terminally ill patients. However, the American Medical Association and a host of other medical agencies all reject marijuana as medicine. Advocates for drug legalization are looking only at the political repercussions of their actions and whatever social concerns they have are narrowly built. 

These people forget we live in a capitalist society where making money is sadly the bottom line of too many corporations. If drugs are legalized people will be exploited to reach that end. Perhaps we do need better drug treatment facilities, but legalization of drugs is not an issue. The social, economical, and moral costs would be too great for our country. 

The group favoring drug legalization is small, but it can grow. We must not be afraid to confront these people and defend our ideals and beliefs; it's the only way to keep such a horrible thing from happening.

Headline: Religious blindness, fanaticism endangers society
Author: Andrea Martini
&nbsp;
I would like to begin by clearly stating that my intentions are not to offend or attack anybody, but since I will discuss religion, most likely someone will get offended. 

People believe it best not to discuss religion or politics at social gatherings or in public because these are controversial subjects.  

However, I believe they are very important subjects and are only controversial when one confronts a person who is blinded by religion. Religious blindness is a very dangerous thing.  It is also very addictive.

I have been putting some thought into the recent sex scandals of the Catholic Church and all the priests who have confessed to sexually abusing several children.

It is hard to analyze an issue like this without allowing repulsion and scorn to fill one's heart, but I still try to look at the big picture in order to make sense out of this, because my mind cannot understand such atrocious acts.

But part of this problem also lies in the religious blindness of the children's parents.  I am sure that good and loving parents don't want their kids to be sexually abused.  Their lack of awareness was probably based by an unconscious, blind trust inspired by religious loyalty.

As someone who grew up in a conservative, although not too strict, Catholic family, I can certainly understand this type of blind trust. After all, I was raised under the notion that priests are the representation of God Himself on this earth. 

Nevertheless, I can remember how, as a child, my mother used to tell me I should not let anybody touch me. Regardless of whether or not a person is a priest. 

When I was 12, my mother told me about a certain priest who seemed suspicious to her and warned me to remain at distance. I did notice some strange patterns and decided to follow my mother's advice.

I never found out whether my mother was right or wrong about this priest, and I didn't run the risk of it. My mother chose common sense over dogma and realized that a priest is also a man.  And man has weaknesses. The fact remains that she chose to be realistic with her religious beliefs.

This is similar to blindly religious individuals who often condemn homosexuals seem to be very far off from reality when they don't acknowledge recent scientific research on this issue, which points to slight brain variations amongst homosexuals. What if in the near future, science proves that homosexuality could be caused by genetics? 

Sadly, I am sure the result will be that 300 years from now some church will make a formal apology for condemning gay people and all the injustices they have caused. 

It has happened this way for every great blunder caused by religious groups.  The poor Pope has spent most of his papal term apologizing to everybody. And let's not think for a moment that religious fanatics are only suicide bombers or old Christian ladies who stay at home all day baking cookies.  

I have met several students on this campus who are blinded by religion. I am constantly being approached by Christian students who seek to save my soul and try to get me to convert. However, the last girl took off running in disgust when I tried giving her a flyer for "The Vagina Monologues."

It just seems arrogant to me that these students wish to save me, but are not even willing to listen to my interests. I can respect the whole idea of spreading the word of God as something that is part of their religion, but I can't respect arrogance.  The fact is, religion is a social creation of mankind; it can provide great spiritual comfort and create bonds among social groups, but it still remains man's creation.  

And just like everything else that man creates, it is under constant change due to civilization's progress. Individuals should always try to balance religious beliefs to the reality of the society and of the time they live in.

Winners

FIU:  Finally the fair is leaving, and we reclaim our campus and parking lots. In retrospect, we should take a few lessons from the carnies. It seems to us that parking trailers near campus would do wonders for housing.

Alternative Spring Break: Sacrificing spring break for a good cause takes a good deal of dedication. I was planning on participating myself, until a gang of scantily clad party-goers attacked me on the street and forced me to do a keg stand. I always hate it when that happens, don't you?

The Vagina Monologues: We congratulate the dedicated students and alumni who put this together, despite the title's flagrant false-advertisement.

Losers
  
Biscayne Bay Campus SGA: With so many positions running uncontested, "elections" is kind of a broad term don't you think? Student government coronations is more like it.

United Kingdom: With the death of the Queen Mum, only Elizabeth II stands between the throne and either Charles or a pretty party-boy. Had this happened in America, we would settle it the civilized way: by having father and son duke it out on television for ratings. 

Death to Smoochy: Now, math has never been my strong-point, but I'm guessing that for a $50 million movie, opening with $4.3 million is not a good thing.

Headline: Track team breaks records; softball ranked
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
The FIU outdoor track and field team established two new school records Saturday at the Florida Relays in Gainesville.

Freshman Jamare Clarington finished fifth in the men's 110m hurdles with a new school record mark of 14.05, a quarter-second faster than the previous best of 14.30 set two years ago by Gerald Waugh.

Senior Jarod Mills established a new FIU record with a men's discus throw of 164-feet, surpassing his own record of 147-feet-1 during the 2000 season.

Other top finishes by the Golden Panthers included a third-place finish by junior Rebecca Rodriguez in the women's 5,000-meter run (17:46.76).

FIU also had a pair of fourth-place showings in the women's 200 meters by sophomore Vronique Wilson, whose time of 23.30 was the second-fastest among all collegians, and senior Luiz Prestes' 3:52.88 in the men's 1,500 meters.

Wilson finished seventh among 47 competitors in the women's 100m dash with a time of 11.66.

Softball

The FIU softball team is ranked in the first regional poll conducted by the NCAA. The regional poll ranks the top ten teams in each region every two weeks. The NCAA doesn't rank the ten teams until the third ranking in four weeks.

FIU is in the Midwest Region, one of two schools ranked in the Sun Belt Conference. Other teams in the top ten are Baylor, Lousiana-Lafayette (Sun Belt member), Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Southern Illinois, Southwest Texas State, Texas and Texas A&M.

The Golden Panthers sport a 28-22 record, and have played seven teams ranked in the top 25 of the latest USA Today/NFCA Top 25 poll. FIU defeated then-No. 14 Iowa twice over the past weekend at the FAU Parent's Weekend Invitational.

Freshman pitcher Amanda Nealer was named the Sun Belt Conference Pitcher of the Week. Nealer appeared in three games, finishing 2-0, with an ERA of 0.58.

During the week, Nealer pitched a complete-game victory over No. 23 Minnesota. She allowed only one run and one hit in the contest.

The left-hander then picked up the win against No. 14 Iowa. Throwing in middle relief, Nealer allowed no runs.

The Everett, WA native ran her record to 9-4 on the year, with a 1.28 ERA. Nealer has five complete games and two shutouts in nine starts. 

She has given up a team-best .193 opponent batting average and only 15 walks.

Headline: Football ends first week with scrimmage
Author: Alex Braswell, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Hard hits, big runs and a back-of-the-end zone touchdown concluded FIU's first week of spring  practice. Friday ended the week with a 37-play scrimmage.

"For the first week, I can't tell you how pleased I am with this group," head coach Don Strock said. 

Rashod Smith led the running game with 61 yards on 11 carries and a touchdown, while Harold Leath caught three passes for 41 yards and a touchdown.

After the offense failed to move the ball on its first two possessions, due to an interception and a punt, the running game provided a burst.

On a third-and-five from the 49-yard line, Jerrid Lundstedt burst through the defense, faking out one defender and cutting left on another, on the way to a scrimmage long 39-yard run, before being taken down at the 10. 

On the next play, Smith broke through several tackles and carried several would be tacklers into the end zone for the first touchdown of the afternoon. 

"I was impressed with Rashod this afternoon and Jerrid did a good job at both running back in the single back formation, and at fullback," Strock said. 

The big hit of the day was on the last offensive series of the afternoon. 
Smith gained six yards the hard way as he was hoisted up and brought back down by several defenders. 

The offense put up its second touchdown on the last play of the scrimmage when quarterback David Tabor found Leath, who seemingly popped out of nowhere in the back of the end zone for a 15-yard pass on fourth-and-five. 

Tabor completed five of 13 passes for 60 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.

There was some miscommunication between Tabor and his receivers, but the ex-Miami Dolphin quarterback Strock, put the fault on the receivers and not his QB. 

"Sure we had some breakdowns this afternoon. We ran some plays that we didn't have in the fall. A couple of them looked pretty good, and a couple we'll probably throw away in the trash can. But that's what this time of year is for – to see if we can do it or not." 

Overall, the FIU offense accumulated 170 yards, rushing for 105 yards and passing for 65 yards.

Headline: No. 20 baseball defeats Ohio St, loses Sun Belt series
Author: Alex Braswell, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU baseball team defeated No. 21 Ohio State but dropped two of three conference games this week, taking their record to 26-7 overall and 3-3 in the Sun Belt.

FIU 7, Ohio State 6 

In a battle between two top 25 teams, No. 20 FIU overcame No. 21 Ohio State (12-4) 7-6 in Homestead. The Golden Panthers were led offensively by Brad Eldred and Tommy Dueñas, both who went 2-4 with a homerun and a RBI. Skip Adams also went deep, his fifth in five games. Derek Taylor earned the win pitching 2.2 innings, while allowing no earned runs. 
It was FIU's fifth win against top-25 teams. 

Down 7-5 in the top of the ninth, the Buckeyes' rally fell short. Joe Wilkins hit a RBI single scoring Drew Anderson to close the lead to 7-6 but Luis Gazitua struck out Christian Snavely to end the game. Gazitua pitched the final two innings to earn his fourth save of the year. 

Eldred hit his 14th home run of the year, a solo shot in the bottom of the eighth that would end up representing the winning run for the Golden Panthers. 

Ohio State would not go down without a fight as the Buckeyes hit Sanchez hard, rallying with four runs in the fourth to take the lead. 

FIU got on the scoreboard in the bottom of the second inning, leading off with four consecutive singles. Alex Suarex extended his hitting streak to 13 games. Adams hit a RBI single to left field scoring Eldred. Daniel Bustamante scored the second run when Buckeye's shortstop Brett Garrard committed an error. Alex  Ansoleaga knocked in Dueñas on a sacrifice fly to give FIU the 3-0 lead. 

FIU 6, Lafayette 5 

FIU held on to defeat Sun Belt opponent Lafayette (7-8) 6-5 for a fourth consecutive win.  Matthew Crandall picked up the win to improve his record to 2-1, while starting pitcher Carlos Alvarez pitched an effective five innings allowing no runs and giving up just four hits in a no-decision.

Freshman catcher Adrian Cassanova, son of FIU assistant coach Rolando Cassanova, had his first collegiate start, going 2-3 at the plate.

Lafayette rallied late in the game, scoring one run in each of the seventh and eighth innings. 

The Golden Panthers were able to break away in thesixth inning with three runs.

Adam Summerell scored the go-ahead run when pinch hitter Bustamante grounded out. Hector Nuñez hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Ansoleaga. Eldred added a solo home run for the third run. 

Eldred now has 15 homeruns on the season and 30 on his career, moving past Jeff Rodriguez for second all-time in school history. 

He is one behind leaders Luis Fernandez and Sean Mahoney, with 31. 

FIU's Alex Suarez ended his 13-game hitting streak as he flied out to right field in his only at-bat of the game in the eighth inning. 

Louisiana- Lafayette 4, FIU 1 

Behind the pitching of ULL's Justin Gabriel (5-1), FIU's usually productive batters went cold as the Golden Panthers suffered their first conference loss at home, losing 4-1 to Louisiana-Lafayette (19-9, 3-1). Gabriel pitched a complete game, his second of the year, allowing only one run on eight hits. 

FIU starting pitcher Arthur Santos lost the pitcher's duel, allowing seven hits and only two earned runs on 6.2 innings of work. 

Two strong-armed defensive plays by Eldred, known better for his offensive output, in the first three innings denied the Ragin Cajuns runs early on. 

In the first, Charles Redmond advanced to third on a infield hit by Bryan Sneed, but was caught at the plate. Eldred caught the cut off throw at the mound and threw to Dueñas at home for the tag out. 

In the third, Eldred again caught the cut-off throw from Summerell and gunned down Jason Wilson at home plate. 

FIU produced its only run of the game in the bottom of the fourth. Skip Adams blasted a two out hit over centerfielder Jason Wilson for a triple. Dennis Diaz followed with an RBI single, his seventeenth of the season, to bring in Adams and cut the Ragin Cajuns lead to one. 

Louisiana Lafayette 9, FIU 4

FIU  suffered their second consecutive loss to Louisiana-Lafayette, 9-4, as the Ragin Cajuns collected a season-high 16 hits along with nine runs. 

FIU starting pitcher Michael Baluja (4-1) took the loss as he was hit hard and fast, lasting only three innings, giving up seven runs and a personal-high 12 hits.  Louisiana Lafayette's starter Andy Gros improved his record to 4-3 on the season, recording his third complete game of the year. 

"There pitching was pretty good,us hitters got to make some adjustments but I think we'll be alright," Bernie Gonzalez said.

The Ragin Cajuns pounced on Baluja for seven hits and five runs while sending 11 batters to the plate. 

"We had so many window of opportunities, but we didn't cash in on the windows," head coach Danny Price said. 

Louisiana-Lafayette increased their lead back to five as Coles singled and Sneed followed with a high homerun to left field for a 7-2 lead. Gonzalez got back a run for FIU as he took a 1-1 count over the left field wall, for hisseventh of the year and cut the lead 7-3. 

FIU 9, Louisiana Lafayette 7

Down 7-4 heading into the eighth, FIU rallied with five runs to take the lead and held on for the win, defeating Louisiana-Lafayette (20-10, 4-2) 9-7. 

Skip Adams hit a two-run home run to close the game to 7-6 and Gonzalez' three-run home run in the eighth, gave the Golden Panthers the game winning 9-7 score.  

Alvarez ended the game with three straight outs to escape a bases loaded jam and pick up his first save at FIU. 

In the fourth the Ragin Cajuns tied the game at 3-3. With two outs, Shelton walked and Justin Morgan hit an infield single and FIU third baseman Adams overthrew first base as Shelton scored from first.

Relief pitcher Michael Mendez was pulled after loading the bases with three walks and no outs. Alvarez struck out two and had a groundout to end the game.

Headline: Rose comes to America to climb into tennis spotlight
Author: Pete Pelegrin, Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Anneliese Rose is a rarity. 

The Trinidad native continues to climb the NCAA tennis ladder and it's her hometown that makes this feat unordinary.

A successful tennis player from Trinidad, ranked as high as No. 37 in singles and No. 18 in doubles, didn't exist – until now.

Trinidad is a country that is a small society of classes with the upper and lower classes being the most prominent.  It's a country known more for its soccer and strict education than for its tennis.    

Due to Trinidad's rigorous educational system, comparable to an Ivy League university, students usually have to give up sports by the age of 15.  

"The level of education is under British rules so the schooling is hard," Rose, a psychology major, said. "It's very difficult to juggle both school and a sport."

Rose picked up tennis from her parents who played it at a country club in Trinidad.

With her joy for tennis, Rose did what most do when seeking better opportunities – she came to America.

"The only way I was going to better my tennis was to move," Rose said.
Rose, who arrived in the United States at age 12, attended Atlantic High School in Boynton Beach, where she led the tennis team to the 1993 district title and won the Most Promising Award.  

She then went on to Florida A&M before transferring to FIU in 1999 where she tied an FIU singles record with a 22-4 mark.

"She's the best out of Trinidad.  There's not a lot of top tennis players from there," head coach Ronni Bernstein said.  "They just don't have the resources or facilities over there."

But they do here in the United States, where Rose has had the good fortune of training with Venus and Serena Williams for two and a half years.

Rose is hesitant to reveal much about her relation ship with the two professional tennis players.

"My brother (Nicholas Rose) was their hitting partner at a tennis academy and he just invited me to come and train with them," Rose reluctantly disclosed.  "I learned a lot from them about the physical and mental parts of the game and match play experience."    

On the court, Rose is an athletic left-hander whose strengths are her court speed, groundstrokes and whiplash forehand.  She's a  competitive, private person who loves tennis, dogs and reggae music.

In her three years at FIU she has earned the respect and admiration of her coach and teammates.

"Anneliese is a great player and team person," Bernstein said.  "She's happy when the team wins, even if she doesn't."

"She's very caring and supportive, a really tough No. 1," Nazly Elsawaf, one of her closest friends on the team, said.

As far as her teammates are concerned, Rose has what it takes to end up playing at the same level as the Williams sisters.

"I can see her playing pro," Cristina Campana, Rose's 25th ranked doubles partner, said.  "Anneliese is determined and confident."

It's that confidence that has helped her succeed, coming from a country not known for tennis. 

If the United States is apple pie and baseball, then Trinidad is the Trinidad Carnival, callalo (a spinach-like vegetable) and soccer.

Rose's biggest win at FIU came in a 3 hour and 10 minute epic battle against the Southeastern Conference powerhouse Kentucky Wildcats.

"I was so tired that my last serve in that match was like 20 miles per hour," Rose said.  "It was a big win for us."

"We had lost the doubles point and the whole match was pretty much back and forth," Bernstein said.  "There was a lot of pressure on Anneliese, but she came through."

It wasn't the first time Rose has dealt with pressure on the tennis court.
Rose has played in six Federation Cups for Trinidad as the country's No. 1 ranked player and has finished as high as second. 

"There's not too many island players, so I consider it a privilege to play for my country," Rose said.  "It's something that I'll always remember."

This year she'll again be playing for Trinidad in late May, in Cuba.

The Trinidadian's other wishes for the rest of her senior season include helping her team crack sponsorship opportunities and trying the pro tour after she graduates.

No matter what the future holds, Rose is glad she came to Miami and FIU.

"The international in Florida International is just like Miami in that they're both truly international," Rose said. "You can do so many different things here.  It's been nice and I've enjoyed it.  Like life, college is what you make of it."

Headline: Quarterback injury hits football
Subheadline: Fleming injury leaves Tabor with opportunity to standout
Author: Beacon Staff Report
&nbsp;
Injuries are a part of the game, but when they reduce your quarterback
corps to one, it's enough to make a coach cringe. 

That's the way it was Monday afternoon for head coach Don Strock as he welcomed his Golden Panthers back for a 90-minute practice at FIU Community Stadium after a two-day Easter break.

Unable to perform was quarterback Joe Fleming, out indefinitely after injuring his left quadriceps muscle, leaving all the signal-calling duties to fellow freshman David Tabor

The 6-feet-1, 225-pound Tabor was a first-team All-Osceola County
quarterback in 2000. During a three-year high school career, Tabor set
county records with more than 5,000 passing yards and 57 touchdowns.

"We tried to keep the workload down, but this is a great opportunity for
David," said Strock. "He's running every play. It may affect our weekend
scrimmage a little bit since obviously, we won't run as many plays. But
for him, it's got to be great work."

With only one able-bodied quarterback, Strock spend a large block of
time at the end of practice working on short yardage and goal line
formations for the first time this spring. The effort was applauded, but
the results met with mixed reviews by the head coach.

"It was good for them to line up in those situations and really go after
it," Strock said. "The effort was there and when the offense went right
at them, they looked pretty good. But when we started going a little
sideways, we had some leakage and several bad plays."

FIU's spring football practice concludes next weekend with the Blue/Gold
Spring Scrimmage on Saturday, April 13 at 1:00 p.m.

Headline: Former FIU Goalkeeper in Premier League
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Having gone undrafted in the MLS Dispersal Draft earlier this year, former FIU goalkeeper Jeff Cassar signed with Bolton Wanderes of the England Premier League on Thursday.

Cassar becomes the third American goalkeeper and the first FIU player in the Premiership. US National team keepers Kasey Keller (Tottenham) and Brad Friedel (Blackburn) also play in England.

"Jeff has been on trial with us for some time now and has impressed us," Bolton manager Sam Allardyce said. "He's a big lad and has a presence in the box. He'll provide great competition for the goalkeepers we have here at the club." 

The other Bolton goalkeepers are Jussi Jaaskelainen, Kevin Poole and Steve Banks.

Cassar did not see any action on Sunday when Bolton defeated Aston Villa, 3-2.
 
Kante
 
Former FIU defender Daouda Kante was drafted in the first round of the MLS 2002 Draft but was released earlier this month due to contractual delays.

A favorite of DC United manager Ray Hudson, Kante's delay is due to his international status.  A native of Mali, Kante has yet to sign an MLS contract.  Even so, awaiting a work visa from the INS Department may take some time and Kante wouldn't be available for a couple of weeks.

Kante was supposed to help in the defense, since DC starter Eddie Pope will be leaving in mid-May to join the US National team in Japan for the 2002 World Cup.

"We're still evaluating what we want to do with him," United technical director Dave Kasper said. "We've got to make some decisions soon."

FIU in the MLS
 
Steve Ralston had an assist in the New England Revolutions' 3-1 loss to NY/NJ Metrostars last Saturday. The midfielder formerly played with the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Tyronne Marshall, a former Fusion player, did not see any action in the Los Angeles Galaxy's season opening 2-1 OT win over DC United. Marshall, a defender, has an ankle sprain.

Headline: Arroyo signs with NBA's Denver Nuggets for remainder of season
Author: Marisabel Muñoz / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Despite getting the flu in the last few days of his second 10-day contract, ex-FIU guard Carlos Arroyo, was signed by the Denver Nuggets.

The Nuggets (22-50) announced Tuesday that they would keep Arroyo for the rest of the season with a team option for next season. The Puerto Rico native is scoring 4.4 points and 2.7 assists in 15.7 minutes per game. Arroyo has seen action in 11 games with the Nuggets, including a loss versus the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena. 

Raja Bell, of the Philadelphia 76ers, is the only other Golden Panther in the NBA. He played through two 10-day contracts last season and was resigned for this season after an impressive summer league performance.

"I'm so, so happy about this opportunity," Arroyo said.  "I said before I got here that I wanted to take care of every chance I get, and it just paid off."

Arroyo had his best game in Orlando, a week earlier. where he scored 11 points, grabbed four rebounds and had five assists in 27 minutes. He followed that performance with eight assists in his first NBA start against the Detroit Pistons. 

A few days ago, starter Tim Hardaway broke a foot and will be out for the rest of the season. Arroyo was unable to play two games after that due to high fever. There are 10 games remaining for the Nuggets.

Arroyo began the season in the NBA with the Toronto Raptors, who invited him to pre-season workouts and signed him as an undrafted rookie. There he played 17 games, had 30 points, 12 rebounds and 21 assists.

Just prior to the point of guaranteeing contracts on Jan. 8, Arroyo was waived. 

The point guard then signed a one-month contract with Tau Ceramica of the Spanish League in February, where he saw minutes in the Euroleague and ACB leagues. He replaced American Elmer Bennett, who was rehabbing an injury.

Arroyo joined the Nuggets in early March.

Reports out of his hometown expect Arroyo to return for the Puerto Rican Superior League. Arroyo's team, Cangrejos de Santurce, is the defending champion. 

Arroyo's commitments do not end there. He is also expected to play in the 2002 World Basketball Championship in late August. Arroyo would miss part of the Nuggets' summer league, should he remain with the team. 

Arroyo will know if he will remain a Nugget for the 2003 season on August 15.

"They didn't have to [offer an option on the contract] for next year. It must be because they have seen something that they like and they are hoping to keep me in their plans," Arroyo said. 

"I am very happy because I realize that I can achieve all my dreams through hard work. It has paid off. I am very positive."

Headline: Punch card voting system ousted by 2003 elections
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Student government elections will be held today and tomorrow at four polling sites located on the University Park Campus and one location off campus at the Center for Engineering and Applied Sciences. This is also the last year the punch cards system, which the county employs for all federal, state, county and city elections will be used in an FIU election.

"We're going to move to the computerized system next year," Elections Commissioner Malik Wilkes said.

Polls at the Graham Center Pit, Green Library, housing breezeway and CEAS open at 9 a.m. and close at 7 p.m.

Jessica Morffi and Omar Castillo are running together for president and vice president. They are running against Armando Rodriguez and Maria Garcia. Both tickets are evenly matched on experience. Morffi and Rodriguez have spent the past year on the Student Government Council as representatives at large. Castillo has spent the last year as lower division representative and Garcia is the Honors College representative.
Morffi and Castillo plan on improving the university's Student Information System and in turn use that set up to let students know about events happening on campus.

"We need to use the resources the university offers for our benefits," Morffi said to students during an SGC sponsored candidate debate last Wednesday.

Morffi said she plans on working with other campus organizations to make sure students are informed of on-campus events. 
Castillo said student government should work to improve the communication between the different departments in the buildings on campus.

Rodriguez and Garcia want to give students the opportunity to be able to pay for their food with credit cards, lower or eliminate Credit Union ATM fees, establish a free law counseling service for students and having more student ticket appeals officers. Rodriguez is the only student appeals officer.

Their plans also include making up more student government scholarships. "We'll try to create more scholarships for international students," Rodriguez said.

Six candidates are running for representative at large. Of those six, students can only elect three.

The candidates are Marlon Font, who served as SGC's academic affairs chair during the summer and fall semester; Max Gauthier, who is currently the SGC Campus Life chair; Jorge Rosario, SGC's staff writer; Clayton Solomon, SGC's Student Union chair and Bill Wilson, who represents the Student Programming Council before student government. Jaimie Eson, a freshman, is also one of the candidates.

Five candidates, Sergio Balsinde, Jessica Franchi-Alfaro, Simon Pineres, Jaqueline Sosa and Reinaldo Villa are running for lower division representative. Only two of the candidates can be elected into office. Franchi-Alfaro, Pineres and Sosa are currently serving as SGC interns. Franchi-Alfaro serves as the intern for SGC's student services and Sosa is the intern for SGC President Victor Romano.

Senen Garcia and Samir Qureshi are running for the College of Business seat. Qureshi currently holds that seat, which was held by former SGC Vice President Yahira Arizaleta. Garcia was the former president of the business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi.

The College of Engineering seat is up for grabs and three candidates are running for the position. They include incumbent Adrian Arbide,  Luis Martinez and Shusheng Ye.

Arianne B. Britt and Damion Dunn are facing off for the Honors College seat. Dunn is currently serving as the housing representative on the council.

Steve Ramirez is running unopposed for the College of Arts and Sciences seat, Christine Carbot is running unopposed for the College of Education seat, Salman Azhar is running unopposed for one of two open graduate student seats and Kimberly Skiffington is also running without competition for the housing seat. 

There are no candidates running for the College of Health and Urban Affairs seat and the School of Architecture seat. Earlier in the semester the council also created a seat for the College of Law, but since there are no law students in the university yet, Wilkes said that seat along with the CHUA and architecture seat will most likely be filled during a special election next year.

So far, Wilkes has yet to levy any fines against the candidates.

"There have not been any fines yet," he said. "But there has been a problem with having too many fliers on a board."
Wilkes will issue a warning to all candidates.

Headline: Candidates square off at UP debate
Author: Chrystian Tejedor / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Hordes of students surrounded the Graham Center Pit last Wednesday afternoon to hear what the candidates running for student government president, vice president, representative at large and lower division representative felt were the strongest issues affecting this year's race.

At times, applause and cheers coming from students wearing blue shirts supporting Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates Jessica Morffi and Omar Castillo and students wearing the yellow shirts in support of Armando Rodriguez and Maria Garcia drowned the candidates out. Only after a lengthy cheering session for each presidential and vice presidential ticket were the candidates able to speak.

PLATFORMS

Debate moderator John Stack, an FIU professor of politics and law, let Morffi and Castillo go first. Their main concern was student access to the services provided by the university.

Students should be made aware of the events and activities being held on campus, Morffi said. "Student Information Services needs to be broader, bigger and better," Morffi said. "You need to come in and take [advantage of] every penny you put into it."

The Morffi and Castillo ticket feels the internet is the best way to reach the university's students.

Wally Crittenden, who works with student government, later asked Morffi where the university was lacking in communication.

"We lack in communication because many students are apathetic," she said, "mainly because they're commuter students. We have to promote programs for students and have an open door policy for students."

Reiterating her platform, Morffi urged students to take advantage of the available services.

"Everyone sitting in an office in this building works for you," she said. "We need to make sure they are and we can't do that without a voice."
Rodriguez and Garcia were then given the microphone and began listing their achievements.

"We passed resolutions that have improved student services," Rodriguez said. "Resolutions like that made us the best student government."
Rodriguez then began listing the programs he and his vice president would enact.

"We found out what you wanted and we'll bring you that next year," Rodriguez said.

"Our goals are tangible and are of substance," Garcia said. "We have all the goals and the real issues."

Rodriguez and Garcia plan to give the students the opportunity to pay their meals on campus with a credit card and he said they would work to lower or eliminate ATM fees at the University Credit Union ATMs, something current SGC President Victor Romano had his staff look into. 

And although Garcia said her goals were "tangible and of substance," at least one of them, the ATM issue, has not been for this year's student government.

"Previously they did not have ATM fees," Clayton Solomon, student union chair, said. "I went to the credit union and was directed to Mike Welsh. I couldn't reach him and contacted Felisha Townsend."

Solomon said Townsend, the associate director of the university's business services, told him her department was already looking into it. Solomon said they discovered the credit union's contract gave them the option of charging the fees.

"[ATMs] would be free for the first year, [after that period of time] there was nothing on how it would affect ATMs," Townsend said.

The Credit Union incurred fees associated with running the machines and decided to pass some of the costs to the students, Townsend said. In order for the Credit Union to break even, Townsend said they would have to charge a $3.50 fee. Instead they chose to absorb some of the cost and charge $1.50.

That fee does not go toward all students.

"It's still free for students with an account at the credit union or if they bank at another credit union," Solomon said. "If you bank at any other bank the fee is charged."

Rodriguez said as president he would serve on the Board of Trustees and would place this issue on the agenda and try to remove or lower the fee.
Current SGC President Victor Romano asked Solomon to look into this issue on behalf of student government. Romano, who serves on the BOT has not raised the issue because he has not been able to meet with the Credit Union's board of directors.

Credit Union officials will meet with student government after the elections and discuss why they instituted the fees.

Rodriguez and Garcia said they would try and establish more scholarships for international students and create a shuttle service to take students from the residence halls to the shopping centers across from the university on SW 107th Ave.

Rodriguez said he is considering splitting the cost for the shuttle between student government and the residence.

STACKED DECK

Stack then proceeded to asking the students questions.

The first was directed toward Morffi and Castillo; Stack asked what would be done to include night students in university sponsored events.
Morffi said more student government outreach programs would be scheduled during the night. Castillo said some events are already being held at night.

Rodriguez said his goals are not specific for day or night students. He too would increase funding for night events.

Stack also asked what the candidates would do to expand computer labs. Both tickets agreed that newer computers should be purchased with the $7 million dollar budget student government controls.

Morffi and Castillo were the only candidates Stack asked about issues relating the Biscayne Bay Campus. He wanted to know if University Park's student government would in any way help BBC's.

"We need to work with BBC's student government," Morffi said. "There are some things we need to help them with."

TO THE STUDENTS

Students were also given the opportunity to ask questions. One asked what made each ticket qualified to disburse student government monies.

"We are actually allocating this money this year," Rodriguez said about he and his running mate. "We're going to do it again next year."

Headline: Finance professor given top faculty award
Subheadline: Prakash becomes second professor to earn 'Council of 100' honor
Author: Lorena Velazquez
&nbsp;
"In teaching, either you know it or you don't," says finance professor, Arun Prakash, about being a teacher. This is why Arun Prakash received one of the most prestigious awards FIU can give a faculty member – the Council of 100 Outstanding Faculty of the Year Award last October. Out of more than 1,300 faculty members in all the nine disciplines FIU offers, only three are nominated and one walks away with the prize of $10,000 as well as top recognition for excellent service in research and teaching to students, peers and FIU.

Prakash says teaching is a juggling act among organization, teaching and mob control. He is devoted to these three principles of teaching and says he is blessed that students appreciate his teaching style and voted him last year to be the Best Professor of Master of Science in Finance. 

Prakash has accomplished a series of steps required for the nomination to this award. The first is to have received, at least once, the four awards FIU offers to its faculty which include Excellence in Service, Research, Teaching, and Undergraduate Advising. The Council of 100 is an organization of elite men and women who donate money to the university, and is an invitation-only. Most are businessmen or doctors wanting to encourage achievement in areas of research and teaching. This is a relatively new award.

Professor Naphtalie Rishe, from the School of Computer Science, was the first to receive the award in October of 2000.

Rishe says, "It was a Great Honor as recognition from the committee."
It was a sudden and complete surprise when Prakash heard the result of the award. He knew he was amongst the three finalists, but when it was decided the first Thursday of October, it was a secretive announcement. The university told him that evening, and the ceremony was Friday. The plaque didn't even have his name on it yet. 

Prakash has published and coauthored many books and journals, which allows him to stay in touch with the changes and the technological advances in his field. His teaching style is laid back and relaxing. He asks the class repeatedly about the understanding of the material. He shows step by step how to solve each problem, and writes down each formula before he uses it.

"My goals for the future are to keep doing what I do best," Prakash said, "and put new technology into the classroom." 

But aside from the notoriety and the money Prakash has earned from this award, students of Prakash seem to say the same thing about their professor. Maria Velasquez, a graduate student of Prakash's says he is a very respectful and fair teacher, with a great ability to transmit his knowledge.

"He is respectful towards students, helps, and is available when you have questions." Velasquez values him as a teacher and recommends him to other students.

Eduardo Angulo, former graduate student in Professor Prakash's class says he is, "…a very easy going, intelligent, responsible teacher."
Angulo likes his humor in class, and appreciates his fairness in grading, and his availability to service students outside of class. "He is accessible and reviews in class as well as offers outside of class reviews if students ask for it."

One would never think that this happy, upbeat professor, after 22 years of teaching would have to face the battle of his life. In 1996, Prakash was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw and had to take a leave of absence for a year and a half to recover. He is free form the disease now but says, "it was one and a half years of hell." 

Prakash credits his recovery to his loving wife, Nirmala, and thanks the support showed to him by the former provost of the university, Jim Mau. He feared that his speech would be an impediment to his teaching when doctors told him a section of his jaw had to be removed. He was frightened for his career, as well as the fear the cancer would control his life. Since he loves teaching his only fear was that students couldn't understand him. 

"With cancer it can always come back," Prakash said, "and as a teacher you need knowledge and speech."

It is a struggle he faces and a reality that is hard for him to accept. But this award has put Professor Prakash back on track.

Headline: Students volunteer at Trade Center clean up site
Author: Asra Jawaid / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
This Spring Break, 17 FIU representatives, including 15 students, went to New York City to help clean up the mess left behind by the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11th. 

The group was led by Site Leader Alex Zarut. Patty Temino, the assistant director of the Volunteer Action Center, also attended. 

They left Miami on Saturday, March 16, arriving in New York the next day, and returned to Miami on Sunday, March 24. 

Each day they were there, the group usually woke up by 5 a.m.

 "We all had to be ready to leave [the hotel] by 5:50 a.m. or 6 a.m.," Zarut said. 
Other members of FIU's group, such as junior Alex Corzo, had to work the graveyard shift, which went from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.

Working for the Salvation Army, the group provided a variety of services to other people assisting with the cleanup. 

 "We helped run the Salvation Army tent which provides a resting haven for the relief workers to go get a hot meal, read some letters sent from all over the world, sleep and get any materials they might need, such as gloves, medicine and socks," Zarut said.

These weren't the only activities. In addition to serving food, they sorted out letters kids were writing to wounded firefighters, picked up garbage, and kept an eye out for the tent and tried keeping unwrapped food from flying out of the tent due to the dust and debris.

Although they only worked with a few small groups of people from churches, Zarut said "from firefighters to police to city workders, there were hundreds and of people working at Ground Zero."

Zarut said the workers recovered around 20 bodies in that week alone.  After providing assistance at Ground Zero during the daytime, the group usually toured New York City at night. 

They visited attractions such as Times Square, Canal Street, the Empire State Building, Central Park. 

 "We even got to go to Battery Park where they have a sculpture that was inside the towers that was not completely destroyed by the collapse of the towers," said Corzo.

The trip cost a total of $95.00 for each participant, plus a little extra money for transportation from New Jersey to New York City. 

For many of the participants, this was their first time participating in an Alternative Spring Break trip. Alex Corzo was one such member of the group and seemed to throroughly enjoy the experience.

"I enjoyed this program because I got to give back to my country in the most predominant way I could, being where it happened," Corzo said. "I know you can give monetary donations and goods, such as food, water, etc., but the act of giving my time and spring break gave me a chance to realize how great and strong this country really is. I'm certainly never going to forget this life changing experience."

Headline: BBC elections have not been advertised well, students say
Author: Adrienne Celaya / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students will be able to cast their votes today and tomorrow at the Biscayne Bay Campus to elect the next Student Government Council. 
The polling station will be located in front of The Oasis in Academic One from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 

However, many students feel they were not properly informed of the  elections.

"I'm not planning on voting," senior Erica Bain said, "The only thing I've heard about is the free pizza, I really don't know anything about the candidates."

Junior Pamela Silva is also not planning to participate on election days.

"I really don't think SGC elections have been advertised very well here," Silva said "I went to the south campus one day this week and was immediately informed of elections."

Incumbent SGC president Adrian Carter is running unopposed for re-election. His agenda includes providing an international student support center and creating study and relaxation areas around the campus.

"I plan on being an active voice with President Modesto Madique to see how we can be funded properly," Carter said.

Carter said he plans on working with the new vice president to continue bringing structure to the SGC while addressing the needs of the student body.

Alexander Lewy is running for the vice president position unopposed. Lewy said he wants to create a more active atmosphere at BBC.

"What I want to see is people coming, staying and having fun at the Biscayne Bay Campus," Lewy said.

Although SGC has three representative at large positions open, Kerry Brown is the only candidate running.

The only contested positions are lower division representatives and College of Health and Urban Affairs representative.

The candidates are Mfonobong Essiet, who is involved with the Student Council Internship Program and Panther Power; Lissette Hernandez, the social events coordinator for the International Student Club and Clayton Schramm, who is Student Services chair, vice-chair of the Campus Life and Finance committees and is currently a lower division representative.
Carmen Gonzalez is also running for that position.

There are two students running for the College of Health and Urban Affairs seat, Kerry Brown and Rasheedah Muhammad. Brown is currently a member of BBC's student government. Muhammad was this year's CHUA representative.

The College of Arts and Sciences Representative Muhammed Malik is running unopposed for another term. His goals include reactivating the Volunteer Action Center and expanding the International Studies Office presence at BBC.

Neil Harrison is running for School of Hospitality representative and Nazly de la Rosa is running for School of Journalism and Mass Communication representative.

There will be open seats in the College of Business, Housing representative, Broward representative and the School of Nursing since no one is running for those positions. 

No fines have been issued for violations during campaigning.

Headline: Candidates deliver platforms at BBC debate
Author: Adrienne Celaya / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
SGA candidates took their places on the podium at the "Meet the Candidates" debate, although few students were willing to listen. 

On March 27 the Biscayne Bay Campus' Student Government Association officially presented next year's potential student government officials at a debate at Wolfe University Center's Panther Square. As an incentive, free pizza was given out after the event, though many students were already in line 20 minutes into the hour-long program. Students were on hand to witness their potential Student Government Council leaders but many solely came for the pizza.

After the candidates stepped up and gave their speech, Assistant Director of Campus Life and Orientation Rafael Zapata asked alternating questions relating to school spirit, their future agendas, and personal characteristics.

There are four candidates running for the two lower division representative positions this year, and only two out of the four opted to attend the debate.

Current Lower Division Representative Clayton "Hank" Schramm began his campaign speech with a list of some of the things he had done during the 2001-2002 year. This included visiting freshman classes to hear the opinions of new students, Schramm is also active in the International Student Committee, Campus Life and Finance Committee, and is also the acting Student Services chair. 

"What distinguishes me from the other candidates is my experience, character and integrity," Schramm said.

Mfonobong Essiet said SGC needs a strong, assertive voice to answer the needs of the student body and make the undergraduate students stand out. 

Essiet said that her involvement in the Student Council Internship Program and Panther Power would make her a more approachable lower division representative.

If elected, one of her main priorities would be to increase school spirit.

"I want more pep rallies and sporting events. Many of the students here like to play sports, but there aren't any activities available," Essiet said.
Carmen Gonzalez and Lissette Hernandez are also running for the lower division representative position, but did not attend the debate.

Incumbent SGC President Adrian Carter is once again in the running, except this time he's uncontested. Carter started out the year as Vice President under Tito Omaghomi and became president when Omaghomi was diqualified from holding office.

At the debate Carter said the four key attributes a president needs are diligence, love, loyalty, and sincerity. All of which he said he possesses and have increased within the past year. 

Carter said he wants to continue his role as president because he wants to finish what he started. 

"We've implemented some new things and want to make sure they stay intact. I want to create consistency within our organization," Carter said.

Carter's 2002-2003 agenda includes more media coverage at BBC, an increase in student relaxation, and research through surveys. He said surveys would let the SGC know what is on students' minds. 

SGC Vice President Angel Garcia will not run for another term due to fall graduation. Instead, candidate Alexander S. Lewy will take on his role for the 2002-2003 year. Lewy does not have competition.

 As the current Campus Life Chair, Lewy said he has helped visually enhance the appearance of BBC and actively supported campus events.
 
"Most students come to this campus, go to class, and then go back home," Lewy said. "I propose to unite this council and bring all of our energies together to bring students what they want. I want students to go to class and want to stay here, not return home right after."

Due to the lack of contested positions and the absence of some of the candidates there was no debate.

When the candidates had finished speaking, Carter answered questions from two students concerned with the lack of printed syllabi and the closing of the games room.

Headline: "Vagina Monologues" opens students' minds
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I'd like to start off by dispelling a great mystery: No, there is no talking vagina in "The Vagina Monologues." I know many were expecting a giant talking vagina, reminiscent of the giant Venus Fly-trap in "Little Shop of Horrors," spouting ominous phrases like: "Feed me, Seymour!" in a thunderous voice. There is none of that. What you will find is a daring play that brings women's experiences to the foreground and evokes a wide range of emotions, from laughter to sadness.

Eve Ensler's groundbreaking play, which has starred many big names since its first performance, ranging from Glen Close and Queen Latifah to Brooke Shields and Isabella Rossellini, makes its way to FIU this spring as part of the V-day movement, an event dedicated to ending violence against women. The FIU performance will play April 5 and 6 at 8:00 p.m. and April 7 at 4:00 p.m. and has been put together entirely by students and alumni. 

The play is a welcome presence on a campus in dire need of being woken up from this coma of conformity that seems to make many students I've encountered afraid of mysterious words like "social questioning" and "vagina."

Sadly the reaction to the play on campus hasn't always been positive. The title itself, which includes this apparently shocking word, "vagina," seems to have elicited negative reaction from students who apparently never learned it isn't wise to judge a book by its cover, or in this case, a play by its title. 

"I think people are just afraid of the power of the word," FIU graduate Rachel Middleton said."It's disappointing when people – especially women – tell us it's disgusting." Luckily, according to Middleton and Adriana de Welde, a junior also working actively with the V-day movement, the overall reaction has been positive. 

"We had so many people show up for the auditions and so much positive energy," de Welde said. "We really hope this is just the beginning."  
Of course, bringing this play to FIU is just the start and a small part of the overall V-Day movement,  which has already garnered much support nationwide. 

As a condition of their work with the movement, all of the proceeds from the FIU production of the play will go towards programs that promote ending violence against women. 

This year, organizers of the FIU production have chosen RAWA, (the Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan), along with Glad Stonehouse, (an organization designed to provide legal advocacy to young girls who have been taken out of abusive homes), MUJER, (an association that works with battered immigrant women in Florida) and FIU's own Victim Advocacy Center. 

Apart from having a strong message, "The Vagina Monologues" is simply good theatre and has rapidly become one of the most talked about and staged plays in the United States. 

Those who attend have the opportunity to not only watch a great play, but also to support a worthwhile cause. "Too many of us know someone who has been victimized," says junior Christina Pelleya. "It happens all the time, and I think it's time we did something about it." We can start by getting over the childish mystery many of us may feel at seeing the word "vagina." 

Taboos and fears of the unknown are some of the major causes of violence against women. "If you can't talk about women's bodies positively," as Middleton said, "then how can you hope to protect them?"

Headline: Tight "Panic Room" captures audience
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
I'm a sucker for a good thriller. Nothing gets me on the edge of my seat quicker than a really tense moment where the slightest mistake could send a character's life into jeopardy. Tension over blaring horror. Scare me by threatening the lives of the characters I've become emotionally attached to, not with cheapr thrills or gory effects.

David Fincher knows what I like and he gives me my medicine in "Panic Room" more times than I can recall any recent films doing. In fact, the entire set-up puts the characters in situations where they're walking a tightrope and the slightest misstep will cause them to fall.

The storyline certainly helps. Divorced woman Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristin Stewart) move into a New York brownstone with a bunch of special amenities including an elevator, four stories of rooms and a security system. But not just any security system.  This system includes a panic room, a steel room where the homeowners can hide in case of a break-in, call the police and watch what's happening in the house through surveillance cameras. 

And this is precisely what happens in the movie on the very first night they're staying in their house, except they haven't hooked up the phone line, leaving them trapped on the inside of a room they desperately want to get out of and leaving the robbers trapped on the outside of a room they desperately want to get into. The reward they're looking for, it turns out, is in the panic room.

It could very easily have been played as a methodically slow movie a la anything by M. Night Shyamalan, with the characters stubbornly refusing to sway from their positions. Instead however, the thrills come from the interaction between the predators and their prey from within their own locations. The thieves try to force them out of the room, which they foil. Foster tries to contact the outside world repeatedly for help, which the thieves foil. It becomes a game of cat and mouse where the mouse ocassionally bites the cat.

It's actually amusing how both the thieves and Foster find themselves in the same situation despite being on opposite ends of the wall. And there's no question what it's intended for. How else can you explain a brilliant twist where the tables are turned on the criminals?

What makes "Panic Room" such a great ride is the cast and the incredible job they do making the audience care for them. And I don't just mean Foster and Stewart. As the robbers, only Dwight Yoakam's Raoul is not sympathetic. For half the film, his character seems to be played only for laughs (the cocky robber who just has to wear a ski mask to hide his identity), so that when he suddenly takes the evil, dark turn you expect him to, it doesn't carry for full effect, making him a cliché of villainy rather than a seriously dubious character.

Everyone else is outstanding. Foster brings a sincere motherly attitude toward her on-screen daughter while at the same time being completely believeable as a character smart enough to outwit the burglars and come up with plans of her own. Stewart does a better job playing a teenager than any teenager has a right to. And Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto (as burglar-buddies Burnham and Junior) manage to turn two villains into characters we care for as much as Meg and Sarah. At a certain point in the film, you'll suddenly realize you're rooting for Meg and Sarah to escape, but you'd love for Burnham and Junior to get away too.

If you're a fan of the snazzy digital shots in 'Flight Club," where the camera does things that should be impossible (i.e. flying into a keyhole or through narrow guardrails), then you already know what a stylized, flashy director Fincher can be. He continues with more of the same in "Panic Room," and you'll love every second of it. It's all here, including his excessively dark locations (subtly, yet brilliantly lit by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), pans that like to follow items around until a certain destination is reached, and an eye and ear to the importance of sound and imagery (or absolutely lack thereof). That more people will probably come out of "Panic Room" content than ever did for "Fight Club," "The Game" or "Seven" is irrelevant. I honestly wish there were more Finchers out there in Hollywood.

If there was any flaw in the terrific script to "Panic Room" (written by David Koepp) it was the strange fascination with pop-culture. Too many references to movies, music, etc. often border on distracting. Some parts are just effort to sound like modern-day vernacular. If someone were constructing some elaborate device out of household items, "MacGyver" is an appropriate nickname. But when a response to "Have you ever read Poe?" gets followed by "No, but I listen to her album all the time," you know you're scrapping the bottom of the pop-culture barrel. Does the audience even have any idea who "Poe" is?

Thankfully, a few bad references can't spoil this movie.

Headline: "Clockstoppers" provides clean family fun
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
I've gotten into deep discussions on the scientific gaffes in "Back to the Future." The number of silly impossibilities and "paradoxes" they conveniently ignore is huge. Yet "Back To The Future" is one of my favorite science-fiction comedies and one of the best films to touch on the concept of time-travel. Like, have you ever noticed that the name of the mall goes from Twin Pines to Lone Pine after Marty runs over a pine tree in 1955?

I mention "Back to the Future" because so many critics have already drawn paralels between it and "Clockstoppers." Both are light family comedies that completely ignore any solid scientific facts on the concept of time. But hey, as far as I'm concerned, every movie expects you to have a little suspension of belief. So no more talk in this review about science outside the film.

In "Clockstoppers," Zak Gibbs (Jesse Bradford) is a teenager with a scientist for a father. One of his father's students, Dr. Doppler (French Stewart), is working on a top-secret project on how to speed up a person's molecules to where they're traveling so fast, everything seems perfectly still. The device is placed inside a watch and sent to Zak's father. Zak finds the watch and decides to have fun with it and a really hot Hispanic girl he has a thing for (Paula Garcés). But when a bad guy named Gates (Michael Biehn) kidnaps his father to finish the project for Doppler, who has escaped, it's up to Zak, "hot Hispanic girl" (her name, if you must know, is Francesca) and Doppler to save him.

If you're already saying to yourself, "I'm not going to see that garbage," let me explain that, yes, "Clockstoppers" just what it sounds like – a comedy aimed at the high school crowd. But that said, it's one of the more enjoyable family films I've seen in a while. The jokes are funny without being vulgar. The story is interesting without violence or sex. I'm not someone who goes on a rampage on the "immorality in modern day cinema" (that would be Bill O'Reilly), but it was very refreshing to be reminded how much can be done without resorting to such tactics.

The special effects in "Clockstoppers" are quite impressive for a family flick. Most of the "hypertime" sequences look like glossy, bright-colored versions of "The Matrix." Objects seem to hover in the air, perfectly still. Well, not perfectly still, because objects aren't frozen, they're just moving really slow, so birds and bees are slowly flapping their wings; beads of water slowly poor; light blurs follow speeding cars as they zip down the street at what appears to be 0.05 mph. 

The cast does an amusing job of keeping the story going without ever loosing interest in the character. Bradford does an admirable job as the exuding a level of boy-ish charm necessary to pull these kinds of flicks off. Biehn plays his evil villain with an over-the-top flair without being excessive, a fine line to walk. Garcés plays the hot Hispanic love interest very well (well enough that I hope we get to see more of her soon; take that statement however you want). And for the first time ever, Stewart's snivveling, squinty-eyed persona does not grate on my nerves. He's not exactly a ball of laughter, but at least he doesn't detract from the flick.

In the end, "Clockstoppers" is plain fun. It's everything you could want in a family flick. And I must commend director Jonathan Frakes for doing something that isn't a "Star Trek" movie. Now if he can just do a movie without "Star Trek" references. Or do you really think it was necessary for Garcés to suddenly belt out with "Make it so, number one?"

Headline: "Death to Smoochy" walks line between comedy, violence
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
If "Death to Smoochy" is a dark comedy, it is the lightest, airiest, gee-golly happiest dark comedy I've ever seen. On the other hand, if "Death To Smoochy" isn't a dark comedy, it's certainly twisted enough to create doubts over the stability of a cast and crew who put together a film like this and think it's a laughable, fluffy comedy.

The only major problem in "Death to Smoochy" is it can't make up its mind about where it wants to go. It's caught between a moral high ground and a dirty mud-hole, on one hand wanting to redeem all the characters because it's fallen in love with them, but at the same time trying to inflict pain on them out of a sense of dark-comic duty. 
Had it gone either way, the film would only have been loved by a spare few. Unfortunately, stuck in the middle, you get both groups shrugging their shoulders in a cartoonish "eh."

The idea behind "Death To Smoochy" is a novel take on the "everyone hates Barney" concept. Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton), dresses up as Smoochy, a loveable fuchsia Rhinoceros who is loved by all except the man he replaced, a singing, tap-dancing, flamboyant children's entertainer named Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams). Stuck without money, a job and, worst of all, a fan-base, Randolph flips and decides that Smoochy must be destroyed as a way to get his job back. And it's not a completely unsound argument considering the other possible hosts are everything from crack-heads to molesters.

As I said, the story cares too much about both Randolph and Sheldon to let anything truly bad happen to them. Sheldon is supposed to be a bastion of goodness and ideal virtues so of course, the audience isn't supposed to hate him. Then again, he's a purple Furry singing about vegan cookies: Barney mixed with hippie. We should hate him. So which direction does the movie go? Well, as far as the movie is concerned, he's the good guy.

Then there's Randolph, whom the movie also likes too much to make him the villain. Instead, he's turned into the poor victim of the situation. He's not the villain because he's Robin Williams. Had the film more guts, Randolph would've gone the entire film one on one, out to destroy Smoochy. It's no wonder that the best moments are when Randolph seems to have succeeded in ruining Smoochy's reputation. We don't want to see him foiled. But the film glazes over all his evil doings as if he's just another innocent bystander, despite the fact that not three minutes into the movie, we see him committing the very crimes that caused him to lose his job in the first place.

Instead, director Danny DeVito and Jon Stewart are the villains the audience is supposed to hate. DeVito is an agent out to earn as much money as he can. Stewart is a network executive in the pocket of a major charity that will kill anyone who gets in its way. It's rather silly and the only completely joyless part of the plot.

"Death to Smoochy" is not a full-throttle comedy with the goal to make you laugh at just about every line (though if Williams could have his way, he'd mug and adlib a joke every time the camera was on him). Instead, the film is nothing more than a steady fit of giggles. Chuckle at Smoochy as a Nazi. Snicker at Randolph's phallic cookies. Chortle during the "Smoochy on Ice" show.

But that's ultimately the problem with "Death to Smoochy." The fact that ending tries to resolve everything in such a neat bow-tie is proof of that.  "Death To Smoochy" is half dark-comedy and half nothing. The dark-comedy part is pretty good, but the nothing is pretty unfulfilling.

Headline: "Eudora" compiles lesser known Get Up Kids track
Author: John Lovell
&nbsp;
In the past decade, a little known musical genre has quickly gained popularity and loyalty in the world of underground music. Sprung forth from the vast stretches of the entire indie music scene, Emo has become so overwhelming, it's almost suffocating. The genre has even begun to scrape beyond the boundaries of its nightclub habitat, especially with the short-lived MTV fame of South Florida's own New Found Glory, as well as other bands such as Saves The Day and Thursday. 

Many will poke fun at the Emo genre, criticizing the supposedly redundant and whiny verses of the heartbroken songwriters. In actuality, this music mainly derives its melodies from punk-rock/alternative roots and mixes in a swirl of sophistication and emotion, hence the name.
However, many of these so-called Emo bands are so diverse and broad in the musical color spectrum that it's foolish to bind them in a specific category. From the suburbs of Kansas City, Missouri, The Get Up Kids are a wonderful example of this level of talent. 

Forming together from a nebula of several Kansas City bands about six years ago, The Get Up Kids have recently been busy making a name for themselves and increasing their national fan base. Early last year, they toured the nation with legendary rock group, Weezer. Since then, the group has released its latest LP, Eudora. Eudora is more than just a new album. What's interesting about this album is that it's not really a new release. Eudora is actually an anthology of 7-inch recordings, compilation releases, cover songs and various other rare and out of print recordings.
Some of the tracks date back to the band's early days, in 1996. Fans of  The Get Up Kids are in for a treat, as the CD takes them on a musical tour of the band's history. Up until now, most of the songs on Eudora could only be found on the Internet or in the dusty vinyl collections of die-hard fans.

You don't have to be a familiar to appreciate this album, though. Even newcomers should enjoy The Get Up Kids' latest triumph. Since this is a collection of songs which were recorded throughout the band's career, Eudora's style is incredibly diverse. As the album progresses, each track brings out a different sound, style, mood and level of talent. From the band's earliest days in 1996 come rough-edged songs which dip slightly into the punk-rock and alternative end of the pool like "Shorty" and "The Breathing Method." Jump all the way up to 1999 and 2000, and The Get Up Kids undergo an immense change and mature musically with songs like "New Found Mass (2000)." At that point in time, the band added a keyboard/piano player to the lineup and was experimenting with string instruments. Similarly, their cover of New Order's "Regret" mixes in a small degree of electronic rock in the background melody which becomes more prominent as the song fades out. Listen to the whole album to get a full perspective of the band's evolution throughout the years.

Another interesting part of Eudora is its wide variety of cover songs. The Get Up Kids master the art of re-making a song by adding their own interpretations and style to the original version while staying true to its main musical scheme. For example, their rendition of David Bowie's "Suffragette City" stays true to its rock and roll roots, just as the Motley Crue cover of "On With The Show" does. They also tackle The Cure's jazzy "Close To Me," in which they adapt to the song's up-beat pace while replacing the popular horn section on the original track with a small keyboard ensemble which better mirrors their own style.

If Eudora isn't a legend, it's the childhood photo-album of a band currently rising to legendary status in its own music scene. Whether your familiar with The Get Up Kids or not, this collection is worth paying attention to, before these songs disappear into oblivion.

Headline: Mary J. Blige focuses on change with "No Drama"
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
"That's what the album is all about, just letting people know that I'm human, and I am a woman," says Mary J. Blige regarding her latest album, No More Drama.  In this album, Blige openly expresses her opinion about drama: We all have lives of constant drama, but it is for us to choose the ways in which we can deal with our own issues. Drama is about feeling joyful versus spending the rest of our lives feeling miserable. Throughout, it is quite apparent that Blige has chosen to deal with life's struggles positively by understanding that she has control over her emotions. Mary's songs prove that "life is life" and problems naturally arise, but everyone has the power to turn that negative action into a positive reaction. Nice idea for a short while. Very short while.
 
One reason why this album is a nice change from other female solo artist albums is because Blige focuses on herself and her own learning process, which began before the release of her 1999 album, Mary. Her positive outlook and strength shine through her words in No More Drama, whereas in Mary, Blige was pretty depressed. 

In Drama, Blige is determined to never revert back to her emotional past; however, although pleasant for a short period of time, this mood of empowerment becomes slightly irritating. What is the deal with so many female artists these days either singing about how dominant they are, or about how much therapy they need? It's almost as though if you go anywhere near them and tread on their feelings, they will bite your head off.  

For instance, let's take a look at "He Think I Don't Know." Give me a break. Already displeased with the bad grammar in the title, I become even more disgruntled as the song plays. 

Mary sings about how her man thinks she is so naïve but she assures us that she is no dim-wit. She is well-aware of what he is doing during his "two hour trips to the store/ How they never have/ What you went there for/ Yet you say to trust you more/ Or is it the fact that you believe/ That your girl is just so naïve." 

Her toughness begins to get on my nerves, for with each song, we learn how much more we can't mess with her. Get over yourself, Mary.
Then we hear the title track, "No More Drama." Though it epitomizes her womanly empowerment, making the song's contents unbearable, at least her vocal repertoire allows for tolerability. But after getting over the fact that her voice sounds fabulous I came across something a little bit bothersome. 

As I was listening to it, I think I must have rewound the song five times before I accepted the fact that she has thankfully added two new words into the English language: "hateration" and "holleration." Excuse me? Sadly enough, I am used to artists using terrible words, but adding new ones? 

That was definitely a turn-off from listening any further, but I didn't shut it off because I wanted to see if Mary would creatively add more vocabulary that Webster didn't know about. OK, so she didn't add any other words, but she did do something equally terrible: sing with Ja Rule. 
I never really thought Ja Rule had much of a voice, but I could still stand listening to his songs for up to 30 seconds when they were played on the radio. 

After hearing "Rainy Dayz," I have decided that Ja Rule should be banned from the music industry. 

Thankfully, I did choose to finish listening to the album because there are a few noteworthy tracks: "PMS," "Forever No More (Poem)" and "Testimony," the last song on the album. "PMS" is good because of its simplicity: Mary's voice, an uncomplicated beat and, best of all, a guitar. The distinctive guitar sounds add so much to the song, and it is for this reason that I do not owe complete praise to Mary for "PMS." 

Whom I really give the most tribute to is Lenny Kravitz for not only utilizing his excellent guitar skills, but for successfully distracting me from the "'No more pain/No more games'"attitude.  

In both "Forever No More – (Poem)" and "Testimony," Mary writes about her life in the past, her life now and her life in the future.  Although they revert back to the empowerment issue, they are nevertheless enjoyable. 
The words implicitly reveal that although she has come a long way, she is still far from redemption. Perhaps these songs ultimately save the album because they bring Mary back to Earth.

Headline: "Sorority Boys" sends quaint message
Author: Danielle Bienenfeld
&nbsp;
Contrary to all expectations, "Sorority Boys" turned out to be this little fun flick that was worth my time. There is not one dull moment in this film, and it is the perfect length of time.  And I must tell you that it is not only funny, but the movie also proves a good point to its audience. 

The movie begins in the fraternity Kappa Omega Kappa (get it?) where we see the typical Hollywood fraternity party in action: beer, perverted guys, idiotic and shallow girls, the whole nine yards. An unwanted female who is spotted at any one of the frat parties is thrown out.

The frat guys take a large net and throw it over the unwelcome individuals to humiliate them. Then it's out the door with them. 

This is precisely what happens to three frat guys who are kicked out of their own frat house for allegedly stealing money from the house's safe. The trio, Barry Watson from ''7th Heaven," Michael Rosenbaum  from ''Smallville,'' and comedian Harland Williams take over.

From here, the movie goes into more hysterical scenes. To locate the tape incriminating them (or proving their innocence), their only option is to dress up in drag and go to the next KOK party. As beautiful as they can possibly look in women's clothes, they are not well-liked by the frat guys. The trio is "netted" and thrown out the door, onto the footsteps of the "ugly girl" sorority, known as Delta Omicron Gamma (DOG, get it?). 
Of course, the actual finding of the video doesn't matter, and thankfully, the writers of the movie do not focus on that aspect. What matters is that Wolodarsky, one of the creative writers of "The Simpsons," directed this film, because many of the scenes are hysterical. 

The trio become members and house residents of DOG. They continue to involve themselves in the whole drag ordeal: fake breasts, high heels, wigs, makeup and finally, finding every possible method of concealing their manhood, if you know what I mean. It comes to the point where they become emotional about the way they physically look, and angry about how they are treated as "women." 

This is where Wolodarsky resorts to typical, heavy-handed "messages" about roofies, date rape and homophobia. Although these scenes appear to be lame, they send a good message to the people of our degenerating society.

Some of the events in the film seem exaggerated; but these things do occur at frat parties. When the trio realizes that they once treated women in the same way they are now being treated, they become extremely angered and some of their masculinity emerges, sometimes unexpectedly. 

While Rosenbaum is trying to gracefully walk down the street in his high heels, a guy rolls down his window day after day to yell comments about Rosenbaum's big butt, so Rosenbaum finally picks up a rock and throws it as hard as he can at the back windshield of the guy's car, smashing the glass and causing the car to swerve. 

Another scene worth mentioning is that of the female football game; the DOGs vs. the cooler chicks of the university. Everyone knows that women are really not nice when they play sports and at this football game, that is definitely noticeable. In addition to hair pulling and scratching, one woman kicks Williams in the crotch. Williams begins to yelp, "My vagina! Help! My vagina hurts!!" 

The actual occurrences in the DOG house are pathetic at times, but mostly humorous and non-offensive. The women sit around in a circle to share their personal problems with the rest of the sorority. One of them cries about her gigantism and being called a freak. Another has an annoying voice and obnoxious laugh, so when someone in class passes her a note recommending she learn sign language, she begins to sob.Yet another has a mustache, has never shaved her armpits in her life and is growing a hideous goatee, so Williams intervenes and shows her how to use a razor blade. 

Wolodarsky's humor again shines through when in the middle of the night, Watson decides to shower in peace, but the head of DOG comes in and wants to shower as well. Only she does not have her contact lenses in so she cannot see that Watson is truly a man. She asks Watson to wash her hair and as he carries out her request, she giggles, "Stop poking me in the butt."

I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time; slight, humorous, and running the perfect amount of time. Nothing was taken to the extreme, which is unlike many other movies I have seen recently.

Headline: El retorno de los ochenta
Author: Mary Aviles / Zona Editor
&nbsp;
Había hecho caso omiso a las señales. O lo que era peor las había querido ignorar por alguna razón inconsciente, pero desde hace rato los gustos y colores ochentosos amenazan con volver y yo quiero evadirme de la realidad.

Primero fue ese aviso sobre "That´s 80´s show", pero pensé que era otra de las ideas hollywoodenses de lo que debe ser el reciclaje. Después vi a un chico no mayor de 16 años con el cabello al estilo del último de los Mohicanos pintado de verde fosforescente, completaba su look con un atuendo de cuero, botas altas y remaches plateados.

"No es posible &#8211;pensé, la última vez que vi a un punk corría el año 87 en Londres". 

Luego, una noche al salir de la universidad, me encontré a un grupo de jovencitos que intentaban girar el cuerpo sobre sus cabezas. 
Los miré otra vez. Y aunque la música era algo diferente, los pasos eran de breakdance.

Ya no tenía más dudas, los ochenta estaban aquí.

No creo que exista una generación que se arrepienta más de la vestimenta de juventud que aquellos que vivimos los ochenta. Y es que hoy vestidos de discreto minimalismo no nos queda otra que condenar esa década excesiva de colores y formas, y tratar de desaparecer las fotos en las que salimos con cruces a lo Madonna.

En esos años, yo, vestida con una camisa abierta sobre un solo hombro, como la de Jennifer Beals en Flashdance, y un pantalón pegado, de las caderas a los tobillos, increpaba a mi mamá sobre su osadía de usar plataformas y pantalones con bota campana. Me parecía lo más horrible del mundo. Juré que nunca me vestiría así por más que la moda me lo dictara. Años después buscaba con ansiedad en los cajones de mi madre algún accesorio auténticamente setentoso. 

Hoy veo las revistas de moda y no sé que me inspira el diseñador Alexander McQueen, no sé si amarlo u odiarlo. Amarlo porque me trae maravillosos recuerdos u odiarlo porque me hace sentir vieja. 

Hasta E. T. regresó después de 20 años.

Veo el dorado por todas partes. Pero definitivamente es un déjà vu. Las bandanas, las bacterias y los colores brillantes de Cindy Lauper, los botines Converse, las cadenas y los alfileres hard core y los estampados escoceses.

Miro mi closet y predominan los colores neutros: gris, blanco, negro, azul marino. Uno que otro estampado y pocos colores brillantes. A veces me parece monótono, pero a la vez prefiero que siga así antes de verlo lleno de fucsias, aguamarina y azul eléctrico.

No sé si a los chicos que bailaban breakdance en la Universidad les diga algo los nombres de Laura Branigan, Nina Hagen, Boy George y Culture Club, Modern Talking o Duran Duran. O si estén dispuestos a vestirse como Prince en "Purple Rain" o como Don Johnson en "Miami Vice". De seguro que sí.

Lo que soy yo resistiré, seguiré siendo minimalista y aunque esa época fue buena y me pone nostálgica, juro que nunca más me pondré hombreras.

Headline: Atrapado y sin seguro
Subheadline: Tanya Lerner
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Si cree que hizo un buen negocio al haber comprado la opción más barata para asegurar su carro, mejor revise con cuidado su contrato porque puede estar equivocado. Este &#8220;ahorro&#8221; le puede salir caro.

Algunos agentes de seguros de carro en Miami ofrecen una prima más baja que la de sus competidores, al incluir descuentos que no aplican al carro asegurado ni a su conductor. De este modo, el agente &#8220;atrapa&#8221; al cliente, al vender el seguro y cobrar su comisión por venta. Sin embargo, el asegurado resulta perjudicado sin saberlo, al tener que pagar más tarde un reajuste en la prima de su seguro, equivalente al valor de los descuentos que le fueron ofrecidos erróneamente.

Frances Alvarado y su novio Daniel Laó compraron la póliza de seguros para su carro con The Gainsco Companies sin imaginar que una semana más tarde recibirían una notificación de la compañía, en la que se les informaba que debían cancelar una prima adicional: &#8220;dimos un &#8216;down payment&#8217; de $287 en efectivo, y supuestamente el pago cada mes quedaría en $121.25. Cuando llegó el segundo pago nos pedían $211.57, lo que significa que quedamos a deber como 400 y pico dólares más&#8221;.  

Cuando Frances y Daniel llamaron a The Gainsco Companies les explicaron que los descuentos que había incluido la agencia no aplicaban a su vehículo. 

Según la guía para el consumidor sobre el Seguro de Automóvil del Departamento de Seguros de la Florida, si el agente cotiza una prima incorrecta, la compañía de seguros debe enmendar ese error. Si el cliente ha pagado en exceso, la compañía le enviará un cheque de reembolso. Si, por el contrario,  no pagó lo suficiente, la compañía le enviará una cuenta y le ofrecerá las siguientes opciones: pagar la prima adicional para la fecha indicada por la compañía si se quiere mantener la cobertura, o cancelar la póliza y obtener un reembolso de la prima. Si el cliente no toma ninguna decisión, la compañía tiene derecho a cancelar la póliza. 

Si se solicita la cancelación de la póliza y el reembolso correspondiente, Jorge Castellano, Especialista de Seguro del Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida, señala que el valor del reembolso podría resultar mucho más bajo que el que se esperaría, toda vez que la compañía de seguros deduce del reembolso algunos costos. Según Castellano, haciendo un cálculo aproximado y no preciso, pues depende de cada compañía de seguros, si se da una cuota inicial de $200, el cliente podría recibir tan sólo $30 de reembolso, aún cuando el carro hubiera estado asegurado por pocas semanas.

Cómo operan

Como parte de la investigación se llenó una solicitud en el website www.insweb.com para obtener cotizaciones de los agentes de seguros afiliados. Al día siguiente, se recibió una llamada de un agente de Allstate que ofreció una prima inferior a otros.   

Se nos explicó rápidamente la cobertura de la póliza, sin mencionar que había descuentos que no coincidían con los datos llenados en la solicitud enviada por Internet, y que por esa razón, la prima del seguro salía $70 más barata a través de este agente de seguros.

Luego de revisar la copia de la cotización se le manifestó al agente que no correspondía a la realidad, y ésta indicó: &#8220;no te preocupes porque eso yo siempre lo hago; yo trato de poner todos los descuentos y nunca ha habido problema. Un señor al que le hice un seguro hace poco tuvo un accidente en la Calle 8 yendo a Naples y mató una persona; él tenía 20.000 de lesiones personales y la compañía se los ha pagado. Nunca nos han llamado, que si fue dueño de casa. Entonces, ¿me entiendes que eso cuando va a un reclamo no lo van a chequear?&#8221;.  

Al consultar la práctica de este agente de seguros con Delia Izquierdo, una de sus colegas de Allstate, ella comentó que &#8220;esa no es una forma correcta de trabajar; uno tiene que darle a la persona lo que en realidad tiene&#8221;. Para Delia  Izquierdo, su colega acude a métodos fraudulentos &#8220;para hacer la venta; para estar más competitivo&#8221;.

Otra modalidad que utilizan algunos funcionarios de las agencias al vender los seguros de carro, es incluir en la póliza los descuentos que corresponden, pero cobrándole al cliente una prima mayor, haciendo de cuenta que no aplicaban los descuentos. De esta manera, el agente de seguros no sólo gana con la comisión por la venta del seguro, sino que además se queda con la diferencia del valor de la prima cobrada de más a su cliente.

A dónde acudir 

Jorge Castellano, del Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida, señala que en estos casos, donde el agente de seguros actúa de manera irregular, el cliente afectado en el condado Miami-Dade debe acudir a la División de Servicios para Consumidores de ese Departamento (401 NW y 2 Avenida Oficina N-307) y llenar un formulario explicando las circunstancias del caso, junto con la documentación apropiada, que puede consistir en cartas, recibos, facturas, contratos y anuncios. También puede llamar a la línea de servicio al consumidor al (305) 377-5235 y enviar el formulario de petición de ayuda por correo. El formulario puede obtenerse en el website www.doi.state.fl.us. 

También se puede hacer un reclamo ante la compañía de seguros directamente. En el caso de la póliza de seguros de Allstate se llamó directamente a la compañía y se denunció al agente. Allstate indicó que seguirá un procedimiento interno para determinar si el agente incumplió la reglamentación de la compañía, y en tal caso, considerará la posibilidad de retirarle la licencia.   

El procedimiento ante el Departamento de Seguros del Estado de la Florida puede llegar inclusive más lejos que cancelarle la licencia a un agente de seguros. Si la División de Servicios para Consumidores encuentra que hay méritos para iniciar una investigación más profunda, remite el caso al Buró de Investigaciones de Agentes y Agencias del Departamento. Patsy Bartola, funcionaria de este buró, explicó que la investigación de ellos se basa en determinar si existe &#8220;evidencia suficiente y clara para presentar una acción administrativa&#8221;. En caso de ser contundente la evidencia, el encargado de continuar la investigación será la División Criminal de Fraude. Si el caso prospera, el agente de seguros fraudulento podría terminar en la cárcel.

Sin embargo, el agente de seguros no es el único que podría terminar en la cárcel. De acuerdo con las leyes del Estado de la Florida, "cualquier persona que con conocimiento y con la intención de dañar, defraudar, o engañar a cualquier asegurador presente una declaración de reclamo o una solicitud conteniendo cualquier información falsa, incompleta o engañosa, es culpable de un crimen de tercer grado&#8221;. Esta advertencia se encuentra impresa en los formularios de todas las compañías de seguros de carro.

De manera que la próxima vez que compre el seguro de su carro, asegúrese de que la información que aparece en su solicitud es correcta. De lo contrario, recuerde que en vez de estar ahorrando unos cuantos dólares, podría acabar pagando mucho más, o inclusive, quedar atrapado sin seguro.

Headline: Turquía, mezcla amigable de dos continentes
Subheadline: Tanya Lerner
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Ogla Sungutay y Baris Evran estudian en FIU, el primero Física y el segundo Finanzas, ambos tienen en común a Turquía, su país de origen. Para Ogla "es un lugar único y extraordinario, pues es como un puente que conecta las culturas oriental y occidental". 

De hecho, Estambul está parte en Europa y parte en Asia. Dos puentes conectan la ciudad con cada uno de estos continentes. Esta aparente dicotomía hace que Turquía sea una mezcla de las culturas europea y oriental. Para Ogla, su país hace parte del Medio Oriente más que de Europa, sin embargo, aclara que "este punto es objeto de mucha controversia". Otros turcos, cuenta Baris, se identifican más con el continente europeo.

Es precisamente esta mezcla de culturas lo que hace que algunos extranjeros no comprendan con facilidad la realidad de este país. Ciertas personas creen que por tener 99% de población de origen musulmán, Turquía es un país islámico. Sin embargo, explica Ogla, Turquía es enteramente secular, libre de inclinación religiosa, como lo indica su Carta Magna. La secularización, de origen europeo, se adoptó en 1923, cuando se formó la República de Turquía. Inclusive ha ido más lejos que en algunos países de Europa: las mujeres, por ejemplo, obtuvieron el derecho al voto en 1930, catorce años antes que Francia. 

De igual forma ha incidido en ciertas costumbres, como la vestimenta, la cual tiene más influencia occidental que oriental. Ogla y Baris señalan que la regla general es que las personas utilicen atuendos occidentales, y que sólo una minoría se incline por el ropaje tradicional de los musulmanes. 

En cuanto a las tradiciones europeas, en Turquía se utiliza el alfabeto latino y no el árabe. El lenguaje oficial es el turco y con frecuencia, los nombres de las personas tienen algún significado en este idioma. Ogla significa "niño", mientras que el nombre de Baris significa "paz".


Música

Otras tradiciones son más cercanas a las del continente asiático. La música folklórica, por ejemplo, tiene ritmos más orientales que occidentales, en parte por los instrumentos que se utiliza, como la Darbuka (instrumento de percusión). A pesar de esto, en Turquía también se escucha música pop y rock, como se conoce en occidente. Uno de los intérpretes turcos más conocidos de éste género es Tarkan, quien se escucha con frecuencia en las calles de South Beach.


Cocina

La cocina en Turquía, es donde se aprecia con mayor facilidad la diversidad cultural del país. Se encuentran desde ensaladas de vegetales parecidas a las del Medio Oriente, hasta la típica comida mediterránea. Ogla cuenta que la mayoría de los platos tienen verduras y aceite de oliva: "éste es de muy buena calidad, y en ocasiones inclusive mejor que el aceite de oliva italiano". Como dato curioso, Ogla añade que el yogurt es un producto alimenticio originario de su país.

Gente

Este panorama general de las costumbres de Turquía, se complementa con la amabilidad de su gente. Baris hace énfasis en que los turcos se caracterizan por ser amigables: "si por ejemplo necesito cualquier tipo de ayuda en Turquía, se que puedo ir a una casa y que voy a recibir su colaboración. La gente es muy, muy amigable".

Baris y Ogla son tan sólo dos de los aproximadamente 40 estudiantes de origen turco que hacen parte de la comunidad de FIU. La amabilidad y cordialidad de ambos hace que provoque tomar un viaje expreso para conocer la verdadera Turquía: una mezcla amigable de dos continentes.

&nbsp;
Tal vez fue determinante la muerte de su familia para que ella misma supiera la lucha que le esperaba. Rosa amaba la vida y sentía respeto por la muerte. Un buen día aparecieron dos miembros del gobierno cubano. Los dos hombres pertenecían al Comité de la Revolución y se llevaron a su padre sin explicación alguna. 

Y es que el Sr. Necolardes se desempeñó como representante de Fulgencio Batista, quien lo consideró su mano derecha en todos los asuntos del gobierno.

En busca de iniciar una nueva vida Rosa se mudó con su hermano a La Habana. Natural de la ciudad de Manzanillo, localizada en la parte oriental de la isla de Cuba, nunca había visitado la capital. Rosa terminó de estudiar ciencias secretariales y comenzó a trabajar en un bufete de abogados. 

En el 1969, su novio y un primo lejano salieron rumbo a España. Al encontrarse sola y vigilada por el gobierno, decidió solicitar permiso para salir del país. En una semana llegó el telegrama explicando los requisitos para obtener la visa. Entre otras formalidades, tenía que trabajar seis meses en el campo. 

La enviaron a Güines, un pueblo cerca de Pinar del Río. El viaje se hacía en unas guaguas lentas y no pasaban a tiempo. Algunos camioneros se ofrecían a llevarla, pero al montarse en el camión la acosaban y le hacían propuestas sexuales. Su trabajo consistía en sembrar 4,500 cebollas diarias y por la noche sentir el frío. "La residencia era una carpa de color marrón. El material era de saco o yute. Todos dormían en literas. La gente se orinaba por el frío. En la mañana se podía observar el hielo en las plantas". 

Luego de cuatro meses la trasladaron a La Habana, a trabajar en una floristería al lado del Cementerio Colón. Allí preparaba coronas para los muertos. Pasó más de medio año y al solicitar la salida se encontró con una necgación. Ella salió protestando. "Estoy cansada, aburrida, quiero acabarme de ir". El jefe del departamento escuchó sus reproches y por indisciplinada la enviaron a trabajar a una granja. 

Finalmente llegó la hora de irse. "Era el año 1971 y mi novio me envió el pasaje. Atrás dejaba el recuerdo de mi familia y de una vida llena de retos".

Hoy, algunos estudiantes del Departamento de Geología de FIU, donde ella trabaja como secretaria, la describen como un personaje. Para Fabián Duque, colombiano y estudiante de doctorado, Rosa mantiene su sentido del humor. "Siempre sonríe y se preocupa por nosotros, los estudiantes". Juana Montanés una cubana-americana y estudiante de geología dice que "lo que hace a Rosa diferente, es que ella no le echa la culpa a Fidel de todo lo que le ha ocurrido en la vida, ni se pasa lamentándose, ni cree que Estados Unidos pueda resolver todos los problemas de Cuba".

En el cenit de la madurez, Rosa recuerda todo lo ocurrido en Cuba como un momento que le tocaba vivir.

&nbsp;
En Miami la diversidad cultural es de todo tipo y en todos los sentidos. La lista de latinoamericanos que viven la engrosan cubanos, venezolanos, argentinos, colombianos, puertorriqueños y mexicanos, entre otros, componen la mayoría de la comunidad "mayamense". 

Y es gracias a este coctel de nacionalidades que nuestra lengua salpicada de humor, diversión y a veces hasta de sabiduría criolla, alegra y le da color a la vida. 

El español de Miami se mezcla como en una especie de concierto, en el que cada acento y expresión idiomática hace del lenguaje una combinación de sonidos musicales. El sabor caribeño lo interpretan los cubanos con su "vaya", los puertorriqueños con su "ay bendito" y los dominicanos con su "oh, pero bueno". 

Los suramericanos también aportan a este concierto de palabras y modismos:los argentinos contribuyen con alguna que otra "boludés", mientras que los "berracos" colombianos y los "chamos" venezolanos no se quedan atrás en el uso de sus jergas locales.

Para los latinos en Miami no hay una forma de hablar mejor que otra. En esta ciudad todo se vale y no es raro escuchar en un mismo grupo de amigos o "panas" decir cosas como: "Vamos a rumbear a South Beach que el reventón es full bacano" o "Güey, vamos a parisear a la playa que esta súper chévere". 

No importa si esta mezcla de expresiones idiomáticas es correcta o incorrecta, porque entre nosotros los latinos nos entendemos de una forma u otra. Como dijo el lingüista José Antonio Pascual en una entrevista hecha por la revista española El Castellano, "queda claro que compartir una lengua significa compartir una cultura, lo que tiene que ver con nuestra manera de vivir y de sentir esa piel social".

Seguramente para los estudiosos del idioma este nuevo español está muy lejos de aquel que se originó en Castilla en el siglo XI. ¿A dónde irá a parar el castellano entre los 40 millones de hispanos y entre los muchos sajones que lo hablan? Qué importa, dejémosle esa tarea a los académicos de la lengua. Mientras tanto, sigamos comunicándonos.

En un ambiente de mucha energía y estricta seguridad, miles de personas visitaron el Bay Front Park en Downtown Miami para disfrutar del evento de música trance más importante del año: el Ultra Electronic Music Festival 2002.

Afuera, los cristales de los autos temblaron y las alarmas se activaron; la gente se paró a escuchar la música trance y a observar el espectáculo de rayos láser sin necesidad de pagar los cincuenta dólares que costaba la boleta de entrada. 

Aquellos más afortunados lograron ver desde adentro los más de ciento cincuenta  DJ&#8217;s de diferentes partes del mundo que tocaron al aire libre  por trece horas sin parar. Algunos de los  más destacados del evento fueron, Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, DJ Tiesto, Deep Dish y George Acosta, entre otros. 

Es el cuarto año que se celebra en Miami este espectáculo de música electrónica y el mismo dio apertura al decimoséptimo aniversario del Winter Music Conferece 2002 que se celebró del  23 al 27 de marzo en el Convention Center de Miami Beach.

Los jóvenes que asistieron al evento mencionaron la importancia de que este tipo de música no se relacione con drogas ni malos ejemplos &#8220;como se ha estado escuchando en la prensa últimamente&#8221;.
