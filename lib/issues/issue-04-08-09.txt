Headline: Garden State: Scrubs' Braff shines through in first directorial endeavor
Author: Jami Bernard / New York Daily News
&nbsp;
A homecoming to New Jersey is filled with signs and wonders in "Garden State," a gently comic debut feature from Zach Braff of TV's "Scrubs."

Braff wrote and directed the film, and stars as the emotionally frozen Andrew Largeman. His thaw begins when he comes home for his mother's funeral after nine years in L.A. trying to get an acting career going.

Andrew, or "Large," as he is called, has been on lithium since he was 9, so his deep-freeze is both real and metaphoric.

The high-school buddies he left behind include a couple of gravediggers (including the consistently excellent Peter Sarsgaard), a kid who struck it rich with a patent for "silent" Velcro - and has been twiddling his thumbs ever since - and a guy clanking around in armor for his job at a theme restaurant.

The old gang is all on drugs of one kind or another, most likely to mask the banality of their lives and their lack of initiative. But Andrew is so drugged already by prescription that his use of recreational drugs just leaves him more alienated.

And yet, Braff isn't dissing his home state. New Jersey comes off rather affectionately as a strange but somehow fitting place to stake a claim.

The chief clue is that the old neighborhood also yields up Sam (Natalie Portman), a quirky, kooky sweetheart who helps pull Andrew out of the ether.

Ian Holm plays Andrew's dad, a shrink with the bad judgment of having taken his son as a patient.

With all the deadpan, off-kilter humor and a protagonist who is comically adrift, there are inevitable echoes of "The Graduate." Lithium here provides the insulation that Benjamin Braddock's swimming pool did in the 1967 film.

But the closest analogy to "Garden State" is Eric Mendelsohn's "Judy Berlin" (1999), another movie with a serenely weird view of an actor's homecoming (in that case, to Babylon, Long Island).

"Garden State," a hit at the Sundance festival, sometimes veers off into preciosity. But it offers something rare in the bond between Andrew and Sam. Their connection follows a believable arc from their first awkward encounter to a specific, believable intimacy, without which the movie's jokiness could have rung hollow.

Subheadline: Tiki trend taking over tropical style
Author: Charlyne Varkonyi Schaub / South Florida Sun-Sentinel
&nbsp;
FT. LAUDERDALE - Paradise lost has been found.

Tiki torches are burning in back yards across America. Thatched-roof bars are serving mai tais, rumrunners and pina coladas. The hula girl has become the motif du jour - on everything from kitschy lamps to dinnerware.

After a 30-year disappearance, it's tiki time once again. We have seen some indications of the trend for the past few years, but now the Polynesian drums are beating so loud they can't be ignored.

Until recently, most folks who wanted a tiki motif had to search yard sales, thrift stores and the Internet. But these days you can find "Polynesian Pop" everywhere - from specialty stores to discounters.

Tommy Bahama, which typically focused on a more upscale tropical look, has added tableware with hula girl chic.

The always on-trend Target recently featured a variety of tiki-themed items for back to dorm as well as tiki string lights, tiki mugs and serving trays for at-home entertaining.

San Francisco publisher Chronicle Books has a "Hula Honeys" series of vintage postcards, coasters, address books, photo albums, stationary and a journal.

If that weren't enough, VH1 is billing this as the "Big Kahuna" summer.

"There is no question (the tiki style) is back, for how long remains to be seen," says Warren Shoulberg, editor in chief of the trade newspaper HFN. 

Shoulberg sees the tiki style as a subset of the popular tropical/palm style.

"Tropical has become a real staple," he says. "It used to be something that was just popular in Florida and maybe for an hour-and-one half up north in July. 

Now, it's a year-round seller all around the country. It's not a novelty anymore, so we have to go further to look for novelty and that's the role tiki is taking now."

SERVING "TIKIPHILES"

For some South Floridians, Polynesian Pop never died. They get their fix going to see the Islanders Revue at the Mai-Kai, which has been operating since 1956, and take home tiki mugs and hula lamps from the gift shop. (Last year, nearly 500 self-proclaimed "tikiphiles" came to the Oakland Park, Fla., restaurant for their second annual Hukilau, a celebration of pop culture of the `50s and `60s. They're coming back Sept. 23-25 for an encore.)

Others have been known to hire the Seminoles or one of the other myriad tiki hut makers to add a bit of laid-back island life to their back yards. But true tikiphiles like Kern Mattei, manager of the Mai-Kai, have taken the tiki look inside the house. 

The half-Tahitian Mattei comes by his love of everything tiki naturally. His mom was a Mai-Kai dancer and his dad was the former general manager. Mattei, who was born in 1966, grew up playing at the Polynesian restaurant.

"I used to climb up on the rocks and stand on the tikis," he says. "The Mai-Kai was like home to me."

It's no surprise that Mattei would decorate the dining room in tiki style in the Fort Lauderdale house that he, his wife, Elke, and two boys moved into two years ago.

Last November, he painted the walls American Traditions' Pompeii Orange and added 2-inch bamboo molding painted with American Traditions' Putty. The walls are decorated with a hand-painted reproduction of a Gauguin, Polynesian artifacts, a tiki mug collection and photos from the Mai-Kai's children's show that feature his children Cheyne, 7, and Nicholas, 4. 

Sliding glass doors are covered with a bamboo curtain. The tropical furniture comes from Pier 1 Imports.

"Everyone who walks into the room goes, `Wow' and that really makes me feel good," Mattei says, noting it's a contrast to the all-white walls in the rest of the house.

"RELAXED FORMALITY"

The tiki trend has spread from small town America to urban sophisticates. Mark Mayfield, editor in chief of House Beautiful magazine, says he's been to two or three luaus recently in Westchester County, the New York suburb where he lives. 

Guests swirled tropical drinks with umbrellas, danced the limbo and listened to Polynesian music. Children wore grass skirts.

Why now? Mayfield says after 9/11 people cut back on travel and they wanted a casual, relaxed atmosphere at home.

"It's a relaxed formality that combines a vacation home with their main home," he says. "All that translates into a lifestyle that looks like you are off to the islands. It's a nostalgia thing, a vacation-at-home thing and an off-the-wall stress reliever."

IT'S AN ESCAPISM

Even some of the folks who bought into the tiki rebirth a few years ago are surprised by its popularity. 

Kerry Colburn, executive editor of the gift division of Chronicle Books, says the publisher came out with its first "Hula Honeys" product in spring 2001.

"It really sort of surprised us," she said. "We thought it was a great collection, but it wasn't tied to a book or a program. The response was so strong. Now we have several `Hula Honeys' products and more are on the way."

She attributes this boom in Polynesian Pop to old-fashioned escapism.

"When things in the world are as difficult at home as they are now, we dream about an earlier, simpler time. Tiki reminds us of cocktails and hammocks, carving out peacefulness and no stress."

Headline: Matthews concert awes SoFla crowd
Author: Gladys Amador / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
On July 31, Dave Matthews Band journeyed into Florida, stopping at the Sound Advice Amphitheatre, to give one of the most alluring, heart-pumping, mouth-wide-open shows DMB fans have ever seen.

Composed of a South African singer/songwriter, two professional jazz musicians, an old-school violinist and a musical genius, this unique group is as eclectic as the music they compose.

Their beats, lyrics, and overall sound never cease to amaze the thousands of fans that go out to watch these mind-blowing concerts. 

The band played an array of songs dating back to their first album and even introduced new material.

They slowed it down a bit with "Satellite," as the night sky, dark over our heads, finally ceased the downpour of rain. All was quiet but the soothing melody of that entrancing song.

As I stood there on the vast lawn, watching Matthews' face on the big screen, I could see the power of his music in the strain of his neck, his voice and the surrender of his eyes. The somber mood balanced the up-tempo rhythm. 

Another compelling song was "Ants Marching." The grooves are full of percussion and featured a great solo performance by Boyd Tinsley on the violin.  The variety of influences that each band member brings to the table is apparent in every individual song.

The audience was led to believe that "Everyday" was last on the list, a song made in the wake of a national tragedy, a song that hoped to bring a message of love and peace. 

However, the crowd-pleasers didn't leave without playing a few more songs.  

As the strums on Matthews' guitar played the start of "Warehouse," the crowd became more than just onlookers but part of the band; displaying a remarkable interaction that led to their usual jam session.

The band is presumably, working on a new studio album, which provided for the three new songs on the set list that night. 

The first was "Joy Ride" followed by "Crazy Easy" and then "Hello Again." The new material was full of more insightful lyrics, more power-pumped instrumentals and more tightly notched sounds.

Their type of music is influenced by country, rock, blues, African music and jazz. They provide a fresh new sound every time.  No simple notes or beats here.  

DBM will continue their 2004 tour as they perform throughout the country until October.

Headline: Handy player on defense
Author: Natalie Sabia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Positioned as the last line of defense, anxiously awaiting the forwards who will soon be running in full force towards him, co-captain Allen Handy is not only ready to defend his home goal, but he is ready to attack. 

 After starting in all twenty-two games last year and ringing in four goals and assists, Allen's performance placed him number sixth on the team with a total of ten points.  

Handy scored his first goal of the season during a 5-1 victory against San Francisco last year. During the season, he helped improve the Golden Panther's defense to a 1.06 goals-against average.  Entering his senior year, Handy has been a huge success to the men's soccer team since his first appearance as a freshman in 2001 and will be closely watched this year as co-captain of the team.

After reaching the NCAA tournament last year, Handy expects a lot from himself and his teammates in what he hopes is another successful season.

  "Everybody knows what is expected of them. Things are good right now, we are all comfortable with each other," said Handy who wants the team go reach the Final Four.

Leaving Texas four years ago for an opportunity to strengthen his ability in Miami was not very challenging for the 21-year-old, considering everything the city has to offer.  

"I knew FIU had great tradition here and the weather played a big factor in my decision," said Handy.

The 6-foot-2-inch defender has been consistent year after year. During his sophomore year, he started in eighteen games, scored the Golden Panther's first goal of the season against Cal State Fullerton and was honored as The Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Week on Oct. 20, 2002.  As a freshman, Handy started in seventeen games finishing with one goal, two assists and four points.

 Playing soccer since he was nine years old, Allen is awaiting the day he can finally show off his collegiate experience to his family.  

"I hope my family can come out to see me play this year," said Handy who is excited to get the season started.  

Handy, a sports management major, is indeed a very talented athlete, but he also has excelled greatly in school.  Handy was appointed to the Honor Roll just last spring and is in tune with his future opportunities.   

"Academically, I just want to graduate," said Handy.

After a successful season  the team had last year, making it to the NCAA, Handy is hopeful Coach Karl Kremser will be happy with their start.  

"Coach just wants everybody to come back in shape," said Handy, "We have to organize a lot better defensively." 

During the off-season, Handy knows he has to focus his time on his game and how he can keep improving it.  

"A lot of players are in club leagues, but I've just been working out on campus," said Handy who works out with his Golden Panther  teammates.

Staying patient while preparing for the season is the normal routine these days for Handy and his teammates.  

He is gathering his thoughts for their upcoming opponents, as well as the new comers to the team.  

"We mold them as they come," said Handy, who believes the team is real close to being put together. 

Getting to the final four this season, along with staying in shape, are goals for Handy.  Ready to work hard and ready for the excitement, Handy keeps his expectations raised for his newly polished team.  

"I want to get All-American, along with All-Conference honors," said Handy.

Headline: Is the USA Dream Team in trouble at Athens? - CON
Subheadline: Better players needed to help nightmare USA team
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Dream Team was as good as it gets. A handful of some of the best players in the history of the game taking on the obviously inferior rest of the world is the stuff of dreams.  What USA basketball is putting on the court in search of Olympic gold this year is a whole lot closer to a nightmare.

International competition is not what it used to be. While American kids have grown up perfecting cross-overs and no-look passes, the rest of the world has been learning the sport from the ground up. This is why European 7-footers have a perimeter jump shot and more international players go earlier in the draft each year. 

Don't get me wrong. The best ball in the world is still played in the birthplace of the sport, but the attention to fundamentals in the global game has helped the world catch up and the USA has to field some of its best if it wants to collect jewelry in the Olympics.  

First, let's keep in mind that this is the youngest and least experienced team to represent the USA since NBA players entered the Olympics in 1992. The average age of this squad, which features Allen Iverson and Tim Duncan as its oldest players, is just above 23 years old. Out of the 12-man roster, five players have played 82 or fewer regular season games in the NBA. 

Team USA is so young that Emeka Okafor, Coach Larry Brown's final selection and the second overall pick in this years NBA draft, has yet to start his first professional basketball game and isn't legally allowed to buy alcohol until September.

No one is pretending that this is USA's crème-de-la-crème. The skills and experience of world class players like Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Kevin Garnett, and Jermaine O'Neal were painfully missed in these exhibition games. Those players decided, because of security issues, prior engagements or a general lack of interest, that they would not represent Team USA.

Just think of what a starting five consisting of Shaq, Garnett, Paul Pierce, McGrady, and Jason Kidd would do to the current Team USA in a game.

Some listed the threat of terrorism as a deterrent from Athens; others had summer weddings to attend. What's the real reason most stars declined their invitations? Money. Players do not get paid to represent their country. 

The team's shortcomings are Shaq-sized and neon pink, in other words, you can't miss them. Yes, youth and inexperience are obstacles. Great coaching, however, can compensate for that and future Hall of Fame Coach Larry Brown carries it in truck loads. The things you can't coach around are the lack of size, true point guards and pure shooters. 

The team lacks a real distributor of the ball. Iverson is more of a scoring point guard, Dwayne Wade is probably better suited as a shooting guard and Stephon Marbury shouldn't even be on this team.

None of the NBA's top 10 three-point shooters are on the team either. Tim Duncan is the only member of Team USA to rank top ten in points per game last year and he was a center and focal point of the Spurs offense.

Perhaps it's the 'Dream Team' mentality itself that's hurting USA Basketball. It's plausible that after failing to acquire top-shelf NBA stars, given America's fascination with big names, the criterion for invitations deviated from filling team needs to selling team jerseys. 

No one will argue that this team, under the leadership of  Duncan and coaching of  Brown, is not good. The raw talent is there, but they might not be good enough for gold.

Subheadline: Young players that want to be there will bring gold
Author: Harry Coleman / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Young, energetic, passionate and full of heart. That's what this years USA men's basketball team is.

The team consists of players who want to play basketball, who love every single aspect of the game. They are not in it for the money or fame, but for the chance to bring the United States a gold medal.

The best players: Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady and Jason Kidd all declined invitations to the team due to injuries, security issues or much needed time off. While people may argue the team needs these players, they are wrong. Olympic basketball signifies the best players in the world, which the players mentioned above are. But, it also signifies players that want to be there and represent the red, white and blue.

The first Dream Team consisted of Jordan, Bird and Magic, quite possibly three of the greatest players of all time, but also players who were proud to represent their country and played with heart. While the players on this year's team may not be the best, they are the ones who never hesitated in saying, "no" to joining Coach Larry Brown and the team on the trip to Athens.

Carmelo Anthony was mad because he was one of the last players picked. Lamar Odom, who was picked after Anthony, said prior to being selected that it would be an honor if the USA Basketball Committee elected him to represent the USA. Dwayne Wade said that being asked to join the Dream Team was the greatest honor he had ever received. 

The average age on the team is almost 23.6 years young, which adds excitement to the team. Rookie sensation, King Lebron James is also on the team, which puts the top-three rookie-of-the-year-vote getters together on the same team. 

The Dream Team lost an exhibition to Italy that stunned the world and left the players embarrassed. While this may look like  an embarrassment, I see it as a learning experience. The following night, the team played Germany as if the game was a championship. The players played fearlessly and determined as if the loss the night before   was a wake-up call. 

Team USA defeated Germany on a Hail Mary, three-point shot with only a second left. As Allen Iversons shot hit nothing but  net, the players gathered around him jumping in excitement. 

This is just an exhibition game but the players enjoyed the win, played their heart out on the court and celebrated a victory. It doesn't matter if you win in an exhibition game or a championship game, a win is a win, and that's what Team USA enjoyed.

Watching the players celebrate almost felt as if you were watching Rocky IV. These players may not be the best the US has to offer, but they want to be there. In history, some of the best teams have not always won. Last year the Marlins defeated the Yankees in an unforgettable underdog story. The Lakers were defeated by the Pistons, when the Lakers had four future Hall of Famers in their starting lineup.

Another point people don't realize include the fact that the competition since the original Dream Team has stepped up. European teams are considered to have some of the best shooters in the Olympics. 

With a young team full of electrifying players, expect Team USA to bring a gold medal this season. Hey, that's what Anthony guaranteed, now isn't that exciting?

Tongue studs.

I really missed the boat on that one. I just couldn't imagine swarms of kids demanding more metal in their mouths, considering most of them had just gotten out of braces.

But, as those with tongue studs say: I wath wong. And by now I have been wrong so many, many times ("Sushi? Who's gonna eat raw fish?" "Why are they putting music on TV?" "Since when do guys go for lesbians?") that perhaps my old boss was right to fire me from my position as, yes, trend spotter.

Like, OK, once I was sent to interview the as-yet-unsigned Beastie Boys. I returned and announced, "Sorry - those guys aren't going anywhere." 

Except, of course, to the top of the charts. 

In my defense, they only stayed there for two decades.

Something similar happened with the Blue Man Group, for whom I predicted a quick Off-Broadway death. Manhattan rents? "I'm sure they'll come down soon!" And, of course, bottled water: "Who's gonna pay for something they can get free?"

On the other hand, maybe I am a perfect bellwether. Because pretty much everything I initially think sounds insane ($3 for coffee), icky (thong undies) or just plain unfathomable ("Reagan? Who'd vote for him?"), usually turns out to be incredibly popular. 

Which means that these trends just may be the next "Survivor."

Real nutritionists say any health benefits are bunk. In fact, the movement's basic tenet - that cooking food destroys its "life essence" - is so silly it reminds me of yoga. Which reminds me of -

YOGA! I know. Already established. But once they're selling yoga shoes even though you're supposed to do yoga WITHOUT shoes, it should be over, right?

CUDDLE PARTIES: Parties where strangers in their p.j.'s get together for a big group hug. Think slumber party plus orgy equals anonymous sex minus ghost stories. Lose/lose.

MEAT HOOK HANGING: According to this very paper, Florida kids are spending their carefree summer days dangling from meat hooks inserted into their shoulders. While one should never underestimate the desire to appall one's parents, this still seems so sick it almost makes me see the appeal of -

KNUCKLE REDUCTION: Supposedly the latest thing: Slicing a joint off one's fingers to look cool. 

Mothers everywhere are begging, "Oh, honey, why can't you do something nice, like pierce your tongue?"

MINI-MOTORCYCLES: Also known as pocket bikes, these are 18-inch motorized versions of real hogs, upon which hip, happenin' adults crouch, zoom and get run over. Perhaps on their way to a cuddle party.

Headline: University education costing taxpayers money
Author: Vanessa Gomez
&nbsp;
University students are taking classes that are not graduation requirements for their majors, consequently costing taxpayers approximately $62 million a year, according to a state audit last month. 

Auditors suggested state lawmakers put pressure on the students exceeding the credits for graduation or reward those who graduate on time to cut back losses.

Legislative auditors are worried because student enrollment is quickly growing and the government may not be able to continue to subsidize university education at the same rate. 

The state audit estimates enrollment to grow five percent a year over the next five years in state universities and community colleges.

The state currently picks up about 75 percent of the cost for in-state students attending one of Florida's public universities. In-state students will pay about $2,070 a year for full-time tuition -- 15 credits a semester, not counting fees. 

The state picks up the tab for about $6,488 in costs per student at state universities and community colleges.

 "My parents told me that if I did not get a scholarship I was going to have to study in Costa Rica, so I worked hard and got the scholarship. Now they want to take it away, I don't think it's fair," said freshman Yamir Calante.

Auditors also suggested that the state could save anywhere from $29 million to $37 million annually if it penalized students for taking 10 or 15 percent more classes than they need to graduate. 

For most students, that translates to 12 to 18 credit hours.

Earlier this year Gov. Jeb Bush tried to pass a "block tuition" initiative, his way of addressing the problem, but the initiative failed in the Legislature. 

Block tuition means a student will be charged the same amount per semester regardless of how many credit hours they take, hence students who do not carry a full time load of classes will lose money. 

The initiative also penalizes students who take too many classes out of their educational track.

"That is not going to work," said sophomore Yamell Araguez. "Almost everyone in this school works, most people are taking as many classes as they can as it is.  "And even if students find the time to attend classes, it would be difficult to pass with an acceptable grade. If they do block tuition at FIU they would be stealing our money."

A four-year bachelor's degree is apparently a luxury since according to statistics from Florida's Department of Education, more than 60 percent of students take six years to graduate with a bachelor's degree.

''I can assure you that the Legislature will take a very hard look at this,'' said Sen. Ken Pruitt (R), supporter of Bright Futures Scholarship  and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ``We don't have the luxury of having a student stay there for six years. We don't have a choice. We've got to have the space," Pruitt told The Miami Herald in a recent article.

Rosa Jones, vice president of academic affairs and undergraduate education at FIU, noted that when students come to the school as freshmen they sometimes are not quite sure of what they want to study.

''The idea of moving students as quickly as you can through the process is not realistic,'' Jones said.

Auditors cited Florida A&M University in Tallahassee and FIU as having the highest percentage of 2002 and 2003 graduates with excess credit hours. 

In 2002, 57 percent of FIU's graduating class had so-called excess hours, the report said. 

Florida State University- with 31 %- had the lowest percentage of graduates exceeding that standard among the 10 state public universities studied. 

"Of course we have more hours, there are never enough or the right classes available when you need them. "There is a minimum amount of classes we need to take a semester to keep our scholarship, so we have to take classes not related to our major," said senior Lucio Acuna.

"They tell us to value education and get the most we can out of college, but then they are wanting to penalize us if we take anything other than our major," said Acuna referring to certain restrictions that might be imposed on students in the future.

$1.4 million grant awarded to Nursing School

The FIU School of Nursing has recently received a $1.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor.


The award, which will be used for the growth and expansion of the university's New Americans in Nursing program, is part of a federal government initiative to identify and solve massive workforce shortages in mostly metropolitan areas.


The two-year-old nursing project searches for foreign-trained doctors with low opportunities and retrains them in the field of nursing.


With aid provided by the grant, the program is now ensured to run for another year allowing classes to increase from 60 to 100 students, along with providing scholarships and a long-distance learning effort for students in Orlando.


HEALTH

Researchers say young people complacent about HIV

People younger than 25-one-third of the U.S. population-account for about 50 percent of all new HIV infections in this country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


The CDC reports that most young patients are infected through sex. Young white gay men continue to make up a significant number of those patients. But blacks are disproportionately affected, accounting for more than half of these new infections.


The median age when an HIV patient is first diagnosed with the disease has fallen steadily-from 35 in 1978 to 25 in 1990. Researchers agree that AIDS patients have been getting younger through the years.


Don Maison, president and chief executive officer of AIDS Services of Dallas said education can do only so much. Young people are always going to experiment.


"It has to do with the mentality you have when you're 18 years old," he said. "You think you're bulletproof. You're healthy; you're vibrant. Those behaviors-you don't think they'll affect you."

&nbsp;
Blood spatter. Bullet trajectories. Dead bodies. Stacey Speer wanted to study them all. 

But when she went looking for an undergraduate forensic science program after a high school class piqued her interest, she found few options out there.

So Speer, 24, spent four years studying biomedical engineering until she could fuel her primary interest.

 Now, she's learning crime scene investigation techniques such as matching tool markings to body parts and analyzing trace materials at the graduate program at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

Today Speer would have more options as an undergraduate because several colleges are beefing up their forensic science classes or adding new majors to their course catalogues. 

The new buzz is leaving some university professors of established programs scratching their heads.

"Both our undergraduate and graduate programs have been around more than 30 years," said Howard Harris, a forensic science professor at the University of New Haven in Connecticut. "Now, all of a sudden, new programs are popping up like mushrooms."

Blame it on "CSI." Or O.J. Both the popularity of crime shows and increased media attention of real-life trials involving DNA spurred this burgeoning student interest, say some forensic science professors.

For these students, the job market looks promising. Staffing needs in the country's crime labs and new forensic science discoveries could turn this heightened interest into good career potential.

"As the population increases, the number of crimes goes up," said Kenneth Melson, president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, a professional organization with 5,000 members. "Because the role of forensic scientists is becoming more entrenched in law enforcement, there is a need for more labs and personnel."

West Virginia University, for example, created its undergraduate forensic identification program at the request of the FBI, said Clifton Bishop, the program director.

In 2001, just a couple years after its inception, a mere three students graduated.

This year, nearly 400 students are majoring in forensic biology, forensic chemistry or forensic examination. 

Forensic examination includes common crime-show activities, such as fingerprint identification, forensic photography and blood-spatter pattern examination. 

Some courses are taught by FBI officials, and students learn the ropes in one of the university's two houses devoted to crime scene investigation instruction.A garage for vehicular examinations is expected to open this fall.

Seattle University just added its forensic science major for undergraduates this school year.

While its 30-year-old criminal justice program does include some forensic science courses, the addition of a separate major nearly doubled the amount of students signing up.

"We're bursting at the seams," said program director Jacqueline Helfgott.

Lock Haven University in Pennsylvania added DNA forensics courses for its biology and chemistry majors in 2002 and Ted Nuttall, who heads the program, fields daily e-mails from curious students. 

Meanwhile, Columbia College in Missouri is experiencing an enrollment boom in its forensic science program, created two years ago in response to what director Michael Lyman called the "rallying cry of students."

For these universities, the challenge is to impart upon students that television portrays a distorted view.

"The main myth that has to be dispelled is that forensic science is the same thing as crime scene investigation," Nuttall said, referring to popular misconceptions. "The other myth is that people in the labs solve cases. Lawyers solve cases. People in the labs provide the evidence," he said.

Headline: Efforts to foil terrorism attacks heightened
Author: Warren P. Strobel and Shashank Bengali / Knight Ridder Newspapers
&nbsp;
U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials said Thursday they have launched a massive, worldwide effort to foil planned terrorist attacks in the United States and Britain this fall, and have apprehended an al-Qaida operative with knowledge of the plans.

The operative, Abu Eisa al Hindi, was arrested Tuesday by British authorities, who acted on a tip from U.S. intelligence.

Al Hindi's name came to light in computer files seized last month in Pakistan showing the terror network conducted surveillance on financial centers in the United States, a U.S. official said. Authorities say they are trying to determine whether al Hindi, who has not been charged, and others detained in Pakistan have accomplices in the United States.

Beyond the arrests in Britain and Pakistan, police have apprehended dozens of suspected terrorists.

Following the bombings in Spain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia authorities have reacted with a more aggressive roundup of al-Qaida surrogates and have shown more willingness to share intelligence across borders.

In the United States, officials  announced the arrest of two men associated with a mosque in Albany, N.Y., on charges of money laundering.

The arrests of Yassin Muhiddin Aref, 34, and Muhammad Mosharref Hossain, 49-which officials said were unrelated to the heightened terror alert announced last Sunday-stem from an FBI sting operation.

An FBI informant posed as an arms salesman involved in a purported plot to sell shoulder-filed missiles and assassinate Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations.

The officials claim that there is evidence that the two men were connected with Ansar al Islam, a violent Islamist group that operated in semiautonomous regions of northern Iraq before the March 2003 U.S. invasion.

President Bush, facing the voters in three months, and his aides are striving to demonstrate that they are prevailing in the war on terrorism, and the White House earlier this week launched an offensive to justify its heightened terror alert.

Critics have questioned the timing of the alert and recent terrorist-related actions in Pakistan, Britain and elsewhere.

Headline: Private donation makes FIU history
Subheadline: College of Business Administration receives a major boost through a $5 million grant
Author: C. Joel Marino / Assistant News Editor
&nbsp;
This summer, the FIU College of Business Administration received what is considered to be the highest cash gift ever given to the university by a single individual: a $5 million grant donated to the school on behalf of R. Kirk Landon, retired CEO of American Bankers Insurance Group. 

The grant, because of its massive sum, will now be eligible for the Florida Matching Funds Program, raising the total worth of the gift to $10 million.

Landon, 75, is best known for having made child-care programs available to all his company's employees, one of many corporate innovations made during his 47 years as the group's chairman. 

Most recently, he has devoted his time and money to major philanthropic projects, including donations to such organizations as the Miami Children's Museum, the Miami-Dade Community Partnership for the Homeless and the construction of recreational parks on the grounds of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Because of this donation, FIU President Modesto A. Maidique has announced the creation of an undergraduate school of business which will be named in Landon's honor.

"Our faculty and students will be proud to work within a school that carries the Landon name," said Joyce Elam, executive dean of the College of Business. "He's a leader, whose vision and values will inspire us."

Since it's founding in 1972 as one of the first schools sponsored by FIU, the College of Business Administration has, over the years, expanded to include the Center for International Business Education and Research, an International Business Honors Program and the Chapman Graduate School of Business, named after the former chairman of the Knight-Ridder company, Alvah H. Chapman.

The college currently enrolls approximately 6,000 students each year, of which 800 are expected to follow further degrees in the graduate school.

"Since FIU is producing the business leaders of tomorrow, it made sense to give to FIU," said Landon in an interview for FIU Magazine.

Most recently, the college's close associate, the FIU Global Entrepreneurship Center, received a $3 million grant from the nationally recognized Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.

Through donations such as these, the FIU administration hopes more recognition will be given to the growing school; already, the College of Business has been ranked with the top 25 colleges in the nation by such periodicals as Hispanic Business and Business Week.
