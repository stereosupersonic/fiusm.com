Headline: One sport down, one more to go for Owens
Author: Natalie Sabia/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A leader and star on both the volleyball and softball team, Jennifer Owens is conquering it all at FIU. With volleyball season just ending, Owens must now shift her attention from the court to the diamond, where the softball team prepares to begin play in 2004.

Owens, 21, led FIU in hitting (.363), doubles (12) and RBI (39) last season, and was a major reason the Golden Panthers reached Regionals for the first time in team history.

She also knocked out two homeruns and provided excellent defense at third base as one of the team's defensive leaders as well. The remarkable part about her effort is that she did all of this directly after putting in a full season of volleyball, dealing with the hectic schedule and long road trips once already this year. 

But if anyone can handle it, it's Owens, who has been a star athlete her whole life.

"Jenny is the best athlete I have ever coached. She has been rock solid for us for four years now and nobody has been as clutch as she has been for us," said head softball coach Kim Gwydir.

Named The Miami Herald's Female Athlete of the year in 2000, Owens entered FIU as a freshman with an invitation to compete in her two favorite sports, volleyball and softball - an invitation she didn't hesitate to accept. Now, four years later in her senior year and competing almost year round, Owens has grown accustomed to having little free time.

"I am very used to having no time to do anything else, but my family gives me a lot of support," said Owens.

 As one of three team captains on the softball team, Jennifer holds the career RBI record at 78, is ranked third in home runs with six and is one of only three two-sport athletes on the team. Despite favoring the infield position of third base, she mostly pitched and played shortstop before entering FIU and was voted Co-Freshman of the Year in the Sun Belt Conference and second-team All-League at third base.

Along with a starting spot on the softball field, Jennifer holds a valuable position on the volleyball team where she posted a .252 hitting percentage.  She finished first as a freshman with 18 block solos and was third in hitting percentage and block assists. 

However, Owens does more than contribute on the field. 

After softball season ends, Owens takes on another role as a director of the "Panther Camp" during the summer at FIU.

As an elementary education major, Owens has only one semester and one season of softball left before she moves on to the next level. 

She hopes to graduate and possibly continue studying to achieve a master's degree.

However, there is still only one piece of the puzzle missing for Owens and FIU. 

"My goal is to just win a conference; we have never won one yet," Owens said. 

If Owens continues to improve on her team-leading hitting numbers from a season ago, the FIU softball team will be even closer to obtaining that goal.

Headline: 2003 sees increase of musical intelligence
Author: John Lovell / Life Editor
&nbsp;
It's that time again. It took me a while but I've finally settled on a list of 2003's greatest music releases. This year's list was one of the more difficult I've had to write about, with so many excellent new albums about and even more debuting artists. However, I'll ask that you don't kick me if you don't recognize any of these bands. Seeing as though this is a college newspaper, I'm taking the initiative to select music that is not only superior but important and making a difference in today's music. 

Although they're really trying hard, Rolling Stone and Blender don't know anything. Maybe this would be a good time to start expanding your musical horizons.

10 - Cat Power, You Are Free

The latest release from singer/songwriter Chan Marshall finally comes to us, nearly five years since her last original material in '98's Moon Pix. Beautiful indie soul music sings with empowering vocals and lyrics. Marshall's saddened music tends to reach out and touch you somehow and is mysteriously uplifting. Listening to You Are Free can be a very releasing experience, with honest tracks that go to the root of the human spirit like "Werewolf," "Free," "Names" and "He War." One of the deeper releases on Matador records this year.

9 - Outkast, Speakerboxx/The Love Below

Those crazy vegetarian hip hoppers from Atlanta have done it again, doubling both the success and the quality of Stankonia. This time around, members Big Boi and Andre 3000 released their own individual albums together in a two-disc set.

Outkast's combined release is an amazing collection of experimental rap that stands out in a market of ridiculously awful music by people who destroy the very fabric of pop culture and dare to call themselves artists. By making a difference, Outkast raises the bar in rap music and challenges others to emulate their creativity.

8 - The Fiery Furnaces, Gallowsbird Bark

One of the many new artists to come out this year, sister and brother Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger's debut competes with the slightly more mainstream White Stripes and kicks serious ass. Similar idea, much more creative and innovative. This quirky album marks the beginning of a hopefully long and interesting record career for the New York based group. 

Although it's easy to see how garage rock is a strong base to their music style, the Fiery Furnaces are obviously influenced by many other styles like folk-pop and the blues, making this release an eclectic mix of powerful music that will surely move you. 

If you fell for the over-stylized sounds of similar bands like the White Stripes, you'll die with Gallowsbird Bark.

7 - The Gossip, Movement

I would say that bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are good for indie-rock newbies, who may not be ready for the awesome power that is The Gossip. A much more formidable band, this Southern-influenced trio proves that style and glam gets old; being as raw as they are is so much more hot. On their strongest release yet, aggressive folk rock blends with bluesy vocals and deep bass to create very engaging music that bites down really hard, really fast and injects you with an addicting dance-venom.

6 - The Postal Service, Give Up

Atari-like dance-electronica mixes with soft-spoken indie rock on the Postal Service's debut release. The group is made up Ben Gibbard, singer of indie pop group Death Cab For Cutie and Jimmy Tamborello, a.k.a electropop act Dntel. 

The result is a pretty little album that is as cute and cuddly as it is danceable. A hit at indie dance clubs and popular among college radio, the new wave-like Postal Service reminds us of the '80s New Order and Human League. It's an interesting little distraction that is more preferable than other new wave/electronically-induced pop acts that have gained indie-cred and popularity recently.

5 - My Morning Jacket, It Still Moves

Reverb rules on My Morning Jacket's newest release. This alternative indie-country group brought us an enchanting treat in this year that resonates with originality. A hodgepodge of musical influences ranging from the deepest darkest Kentucky-country to the funkiest horn-garnished R & B come together on It Still Moves, making it a musical masterpiece. Combined with a very unafraid writing style, My Morning Jacket was one of the most influential releases.

4 - Mates of State, Team Boo

It's extremely hard not to smile when listening to the husband-wife duo Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel's pop creation, Mates of State. Their playful nature is rampant as usual on their latest release which displays all kinds of song and music writing improvement. 

Who knew an organ and a drum set could be so much fun? On this extremely hip album, Gardner and Hammel invite you to join the dance party and have a good ol' time. The music on this album still gives me goosebumps.

3 - Radiohead, Hail to the Thief

It's no surprise that Radiohead's new release was going to be amazing. Taking a step back into Radiohead discography, this album pays homage to a Radiohead that once was and never will be the same again while staying true to their newfound relationship with abstract and intellectually challenging, sometimes mind-boggling, music. The genius of Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood go a long way on Hail to the Thief. A very political release that couldn't have come at a better time. 

2 - Yo La Tengo, Summer Sun

Yo La Tengo gets better at creating music with each album they release. Summer Sun shows us just how comfortable they are with themselves, musically speaking. It's a very soft and dreamy piece of art that gently creeps into your mind at night when you're about to fall asleep. The subtleties on this album are beautiful and make it one of their best works to date. Sweet lyrics and hypnotic rhythms on this album give a new meaning to the word laziness and warm the heart, it's hard not to melt when listening to. This album will have you falling asleep, and I mean that in the best way possible.

1 - The Mars Volta, De-Loused in the Comatorium

My favorite release of the entire year, The Mars Volta's amazing and powerful debut album takes the cake and is by far the best of 2003. Rising from the ashes of power punk group At the Drive In, this band does things with music I never even dreamed of, creating a collection of songs, each one its own epic. Innovative, new and eclectic with too many influences to count, the Mars Volta stand apart in their very own genre of music and are literally untouchable, reaching out and inspiring people of different music tastes and bringing them together. It's impressively new and fresh music that draws you in and shows you just how powerful music can be. A must have for anyone who values music.

Headline: Drainage system proves faulty
Author: Erika Taveras/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In the past, due to unseasonably wet weather, FIU's roadways, sidewalks and parking lots have experienced very heavy flooding.  This has posed the issue of whether or not the drainage system has been operating properly. Conditions have been so bad that some students have preferred missing class to braving the wet walkways.

 "Usually when it rains, a lot of students prefer not to attend their classes because the conditions are very uncomfortable," said Lashonne Outten, a junior and broadcast journalism major.  "Last time it rained, I was unable to walk from my car towards the buildings without stepping into water that rose up to my ankles."

 The Department of Facilities Maintenance and Operations is aware that a problem exists with the current drainage system.  However, the issue does not derive from a lack of the department's efforts and/or maintenance. It is a rather more complex issue. 

There are two separate drainage systems operating within the infrastructure of the university. According to Victor Citarella, assistant vice president of Facilities Management, the first one is that of the sanitary sewer system which consists of extensive underground piping, manholes networks, four hydraulic electro/mechanical lift stations and other ancillary equipment.  Through this drainage method, the collected "black waters" are discharged into the Miami-Dade County water and sewer system for disposal.  

Citarella said that the university is responsible for paying the county a disposal fee for this service.

The second drainage system is responsible for collecting rainwater through a series of underground pipes and catch basins.  After the water is collected, it is released into the lakes of the university.  

Citarella explained that one of the problems with the rainwater drainage system is that the university is not allowed to discharge this water into the sanitary sewers. The county only provides a limited capacity for the sanitary sewer system. In addition, the school is prohibited from releasing waters beyond its property lines.  Therefore, the rainwater drainage system is faced with very restricted space and this in turn may be causing the floods.

"As part of our responsibilities we constantly keep track and control, not
only of this matter, but multiple issues that affect the safety, health and
welfare of our students, faculty and staff," said Citarella.  

The Department of Facility Management performs appropriate preventive maintenance to the drainage problems as part of their regularly scheduled programs. However, these duties might not be enough to help in aiding this issue.  

Enrique Salinas, a junior and broadcast journalism major said, "When it rains heavily, students should be excused from school.  I say this because last time it rained, the water was up to my knees!  The drainage system is screwed up."  

There are also other major impediments in the rainwater drainage system according to Citarella.  

"The topography of the campus is such that the water table is only a couple
of feet below the finish grade of the roads and parking lots; this condition limits the implementation of engineering solutions," he said.  Something that is also very essential is that both FIU campuses are located in flood-zone areas and periodic floods can therefore be expected. As a result, there is only so much that can be done. 

To control and maintain both drainage systems, the Department of Facility Management constantly make sure that the underground piping is clear of any debris that might become an obstruction.  

This way, the maximum flow of water through the network of pipes can be facilitated and floods can be decreased. 

Approximately 160 staff members of the facility management department, labor, day in and day out doing things that nobody knows about until they are no longer done, according to Citarella. 

Regardless of the present conditions with the drainage system, he still holds a positive attitude and credits all the staff of the department for controlling this problem to the best of their abilities.

Headline: Date rape cards test modern love
Author: Vanessa Gomez/News Editor
&nbsp;
Just  imagine: A young man is mesmerized by a beautiful young woman in a nightclub. In his attempt to woo her, he offers her a drink. 

She accepts, but not before she produces a small card from her purse and dabs samples of her rum-and coke on it.

The young man apprehensively asks, "What are you doing?"

 She innocently replies, "Testing it for date rape drugs." 

Ah, romance nowadays.

Well,  this scenario as awkward as it may seem, could be  playing out soon enough around FIU campuses.  

Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Council is currently negotiating a deal with the manufacturer of these date rape cards with the hopes of raising date rape awareness. 

 Drink Safe Labs approached FIU with their product, according to Nicaise Parillon, Biscayne Bay Student Government Council  president.

The Student Government Association, along with the Victim Advocacy Center, are currently researching the amount of on- campus date rape incidents, in order to make a more informed decision.

In a study done by the University of South Florida, 52 percent of women students have experienced some form of sexual victimization, and one in eight college women have been victim of rape.

Parillon said, "It is not only an on-campus issue,  [date rape] can happen to FIU students off campus as well."

Price negotiations with the manufacturer are still in process. Parillon hopes to get 3,000 cards at the price of $1 a piece.

The date rape cards are manufactured by Drink Safe Technologies, and are marketed out of their labs in Delray Beach.

 The cards will be tentatively funded by BBC-SGC, but will be available to both campuses. The topic will be brought up at the next universityy wide SGA meeting and the decision finalized.

Each card is about the size of a credit card and can be used twice to test for the most common date rape drugs, Gamma Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and Ketamine.

Just dab a drop of your drink on one of the two testing areas on the card and wait for it to change color. 

If the test spot turns dark blue in color then the drink has been spiked with either GHB or Ketamine, if there is no reaction then the drink is safe. 

Drink Safe Labs innovated the idea just last year with paper coasters, which eventually evolved into the more durable and accurate date rape cards. 

While there are dozens of date rape drugs out there,GHB and Ketamine are the most commonly used in date rape situations. They lend themselves to this because of their odorless and tasteless properties and their high solubility in alcohol.

According to the Drug Enforcement Agency website, GHB also goes by the name of  "Woman's Viagra," "EZ lay," "Liquid E," "Blue Nitro," "Invigorate," and "Grievous Bodily Harm." GHB exhibits pro-sexual effects by improving tactility, lowering inhibitions in women, enhancing erectile capacity in men and increasing the intensity of orgasms. The "high" lasts one to two hours and a dose at a club can go for as little as a eight to ten dollars.

Ketamine also is known as  "K," "Special K," "Cat Valium," "Kit Kat," "Special la Coke," and "Super Acid."  

The DEA claims that Ketamine effects can range from rapture to paranoia to boredom. The drug usually elicits an out of body or near death experience. 

It causes numbness, loss of coordination, slurred speech and a blank stare. Because Ketamine is an anesthetic it stops the user from feeling pain which can lead to serious injuries.

"K" is a known sexual stimulant and like GHB intensifies the senses, in specific sounds and sight. 

A Ketamine high can last as long as four to six hours, yet it can take a person up to 48 hours to feel completely normal after the high.

With the increasing popularity and availability of these drugs, date rape has become a very serious problem in the collegiate party scene.

Schools like Barry University and Florida Atlantic University have already recognized the problem and are currently offering the date rape cards to their students.

Headline: CPR classes now available
Author: Weeam Hammoudeh/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Department of Environmental Health and Safety is offering Cardiopulmunary Resuscitation, or CPR, classes on campus starting Dec. 3. 

The classes will be offered throughout the week from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m. in CSC 1123 at a cost of $20 per person.  The four-hour classes will train students in both CPR and other life saving first aid techniques that every one should be familiarized with. 

Dive Safety Officer Robert Weisman, who usually teaches the classes, stressed the importance of learning CPR. "At any moment, anyone could collapse," he said. 

With the increase in cardiovascular disease (disease of the heart or blood vessels), knowledge of the technique has become increasingly important. 

Sudden cardiac arrest for example, is the leading cause of death in adults. 

CPR doubles a person's chance of survival from sudden cardiac arrest. The technique can also be used in airwave obstruction, rescue breathing and bringing someone back to life after a heart attack.

 The class is focused around emergencies happening in the work place. It is taught to laboratory instructors in the biology, chemistry and physics departments as well. 

Lab instructors are taught to cope with emergency situations that may arise while conducting class.

 Freshman Maria Hernandez believes that CPR training is very important and something that all students should consider.

A few years ago, her brother wasdrowning and needed to be resuscitated.

 "If my sister had no knowledge of it [CPR], he probably would not have made it," Hernandez said. "You never know when it's going to come in handy."

"It is something used in your personal life," said Weisman, "the knowledge gives you the confidence to react in an emergency."

Headline: Club Energy feeds, entertains members
Author: Maria Merzeau/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While digging into some Italian food, Perry Rudge, off campus advisor for Biscayne Bay Campus' new club, Club Energy discussed upcoming fundraisers and the spring semester at housing on Nov. 18. 

In operation since September, Club Energy is free of charge and available to all FIU students. 

The club provides once-a-month free home-cooked meals to BBC housing students. 

Since the club started, it has offered two big parties with free food and music. 

In the spring semester, the club will offer sports nights, poetry nights, discussion evenings and road trips. 

The club has 130 members registered. In order to be in the club, the student must sign a membership contract and follow three requirements. 

The student must attend a monthly membership meeting, participate in one event per month, and volunteer for one event per semester. 

The president of the club is student Jennifer Sanders, a senior and a social work major. 

"Being in the club enhances your college experience because you get to learn more about other cultures," said Sanders, " And you meet a lot of friends and  you also do a lot of mingling with other cultures." 

The club intends to help FIU students who are having a hard time finding friends in a commuter campus. 

"We provide an environment in which they can feel comfortable," Sanders said. 

According to Taiwo Odediran, the vice president of the club, sophomore and biology major, the club provides social activities and a sense of community. 

The club was funded by the Student Organization Council.

SOC is the department in charge of all clubs and organizations at FIU. 

The SOC gave the club $300 this fall.

The club is sponsored monetarily by Rudge and by Bill Hansen, a Hospitality Management professor.

The club also has other anonymous sponsors. Club members  do fundraisers in order to collect additional funds. 

"This is an exciting club. We are embracing the diversity and we are building a sense of community, in which club members can meet people and build friendships," said Rudge.

"We create an environment where students can make energetic connections."

Hansen and Rudge founded the club.

 "Energy is power. Power by yourself, is only one force, but if you put all the forces together by a community of power, it can make an impact," said Rudge. "We want to make an impact on campus."

"It's a wholesome on- campus club. Students can go to the parties and have fun, with no alcoholic beverages served," Hansen said. 

"At the parties, the students are able to have a good time, get to know one another and develop friendships."

"When I used to live on campus I didn't know anybody. In the club, the members are able to get involved in activities and meet friends," said Rochelle Harris. 

Harris is the temporary secretary for Club Energy, a sophomore and international business and finance major. 

"Miami can be a very cold place for some students, and the club tries to keep them on campus and allows them to enjoy a campus life," Hansen said.

According to Rudge, this club is a great opportunity for BBC housing students. 

More than half of the club members  live in Bay Vista, a BBC housing complex.

"Many housing students need to make a connection on campus, because some of them don't know anybody, so Club Energy offers several activities," Rudge said. 

"For me the club brings social classes together, you make new friends, and is not related to any religion," Mitzie Brown a junior and criminal justice major, said.

To that end, Club Energy emphasizes group activities over any religion or faith. 

Another housing student making new friends in the club is sophomore and political science major, Nicole Carter, who joined the club in September. 

"I think [it] is a great idea that they started the club, because we really needed something like this in BBC, [It] is an easy way to make new friends," said Carter.

Headline: Upcoming spring semester effervescent with activity
Author: Erika Taveras / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the new year rolling by, the FIU community can start preparing for a very culturally and artistically enriching spring semester.  All kinds of events can be anticipated from lecture series, to theatrical performances, exhibitions, and concerts.

The first major event taking place at the beginning of the semester will be the Steven and Dorothea Green lecture series, Jan.16 at 8 p.m. in GL 100. 

The lecture will introduce Abelardo Morell's exhibition, a Cuban-American photographer and MFA  recipient. "Vision Revealed: Selections from the works of Abelardo Morell," is the name of the event that will kick-off his exhibition.  

The pictures displayed will portray worlds that are translated through a series of dark and upside-down images. In addition, the outside and inside worlds have traded places and thus, the pictures he captures are presented in an inside-out manner.  These are the forms of imagery that can be best achieved in Morell's photography.  

He is best known for his "Camera Obscurae" photos in which he takes dark imagery and creates incredible works of art with them. The exhibition will begin at 8:30 p.m. in GL 100. His work will be displayed until March 14, 2004.  

"I recently attended the Mark Klett lecture and really look forward to future lecture events," said Maricel Ruiz, a sophomore and intended Fine Arts major.

The MFA Exhibition is a compilation of works by the most brilliant Fine Arts graduate students.  Participation in this exhibit is one of the final steps required in order to complete a master of Fine Arts degree.  

Next semester, the MFA Exhibition will begin March 26 at 8 p.m.  Works will be exhibited until April 9th.  

The BFA Exhibition, displaying artistic pieces by undergraduate students pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts, will be held from April 19 to the May 2. Both exhibits will be in PC 110.  

The Steven and Dorothea Green critics' lecture series will continue introducing luminary artists, on Feb. 27.  

Host Terry Gross, of National Public Radio's daily program "Fresh Air" will be the guest for the night.  The event will begin at 8 p.m. in GL 100.

In addition to the various exhibitions, the FIU Art Museum will also open their doors to the public for a very action-packed day.  The "Family Days" event will take place  Feb. 24 at 12 p.m.  

Families will have the opportunity to engage in all kinds of activities such as games, storytelling, and face-painting.  The best part of all is that the event will be free of charge and open to everyone. 

"Wednesdays After Hours" is an event put together by the Art Museum, open to the public as well as the FIU community.

On Jan. 28 photographers Eduardo Del Valle and Mirta Gomez will be discussing the art of photography. 

"It's great that events like these are organized and available to people who find an interest in all aspects of art," said Ruiz.  "I love picture-taking and cannot wait for this event, I want to learn all that I can from these professional photographers."

The second "Wednesdays After Hours" event will be Feb. 4.  The Art Museum will invite the public to join a drum circle.  Best of all, the drums will be provided and anyone can join the fun.  

People attending any of these events will meet at the museum gallery at 7 p.m.  Both events will be free.

Dance majors have to perform student and faculty choreographed pieces in the form of annual concerts. These dance concerts will be held in the month of February next semester.  

The performances are held at the FIU studio theatre, VH 100, or at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center. 

The VH 100 series of concerts will be kicked-off by Elena Garcia and IROKO on Friday February 1st.  

April 5 and 6, the "Millennium Dance" will hit the stage.  Katherine Kramer will perform April 12 and 13.  

To resume the semester, an undergraduate concert will be held on the 19 and 20 of April.  All concerts will begin at 8 p.m. 

If looking to catch a great theatrical performance in the spring, you cannot miss "Cabaret." It will be shown at the Mainstage Theatre March 4 - 7 and March 11 - 14. 

The performance will be based on the play by John Van Druten and will feature music by John Kander. Musical numbers will include "Cabaret," "Don't Tell Mama", "Two Ladies" and "It Couldn't Please Me More."

Headline: Napster, iTunes butt heads in downloading brawl
Author: Maureen Ryan / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
My rock 'n' roll fantasy does not involve an electric guitar, smoke machines or a case of Jack Daniel's.

It's a humble yet persistent fantasy, in which I replace the thousands of CDs that clutter my house, car and workspace with one portable device, which I can use to access every song that I own - any time, any place, anywhere.

Reading the rave reviews of Apple's new PC version of its iTunes Music Store (and of course, the store dovetails nicely with Apple's flashy iPod music player), you'd think my musical nirvana had arrived.

To which I'd say, not quite.

My gut feeling is that much of the praise of iTunes is coming from people who never did a whole lot of illegal downloading. If you are familiar with the pleasures - and pains - of file-sharing, you may not exactly have a religious experience when you log onto iTunes or the newly legal Napster.

Both services have their merits, to be sure. Using them, you're unlikely to come across low-quality files, salacious material or RIAA subpoenas. And like most music lovers, I do want artists to get paid. Of course it's disappointing that in the legal-download universe, artists are still getting the shaft, but that's a rant for another day.

So if you're a music lover who wants to do the right thing, how do the new Napster and the new Apple's new PC version of iTunes stack up against each other? Here's one subjective evaluation from a mostly reformed downloader.

Music Availability: Part of me wants to be generous here and give the legal downloading sites the benefit of the doubt - I'd like to report that I found about 50 percent of the songs I was looking for, but truthfully I probably only found about one-third of the music I wanted. This hit rate applies to both sites more or less equally, although on paper Napster has 500,000 songs vs. iTunes' 400,000. 

The upshot here is that music choice is pretty limited on both services because copyright issues are being worked out with many artists. It's frustrating, but I'm not going to rail against that too much, because I'm sure in a few years the situation will be dramatically different.

Downloads and CD burning are speedy on both sites, though iTunes seems slightly faster.

Portability: Remember back in the '80s, when some people got stuck with Beta videotape players? Yes, friends, the entertainment industry is once again playing its favorite game - Shaft the Consumer. Let's say you fall in love with Napster or iTunes. If you're content with keeping songs on your hard drive or burning them on CDs, you have no worries.

If, like me, you have this fantasy of putting boatloads of music on one device so you don't have to tote around dozens of CDs, then you have to choose one service over the other. Songs downloaded on iTunes can only be played on Apple's iPod, and Napster works best with a new, Napster-specific music player. 

Forcing consumers to choose between formats is shortsighted, greedy and wrong. Then again, this is the entertainment industry - should I be surprised that they are not only fighting idiotic turf wars but they also want me to shell out $400 for new hardware? So far, I've resisted - and I think I'll have company, at least until the prices of music players come way down.

Regarding the other portability issues - the number of times you can burn or download a song - the services vary, but unless you want to rip CDs for your entire college dorm, you shouldn't have too many problems on this front.

Cost: Let's see, OutKast's new, 38-song double album is getting all kinds of good reviews - I think I'll buy it! But wait, it's $19.98 on iTunes - and $37 on Napster (actually $37.62 because you have to buy each track individually at $.99). 

That can't be right - because Amazon and my local Virgin Megastore are selling it for $17. Am I supposed to pay more for a downloaded CD that I create myself? Forgive me if I don't fall at the feet of Steve Jobs and his "revolutionary" iTunes store, and breathlessly agree that 99 cents per song - on any site - is a bargain.

And if you think the OutKast example is the only one, think again. I've wanted Drive By Trucker's Southern Rock Opera double album for a while now. It's $19.90 on Napster and $19.80 on iTunes - and $17 on Amazon, for an actual CD with packaging and pictures and liner notes and everything. That's nuts.

Yes, you can pay about $10 apiece for many albums on both services. But I still think music costs too much online. Individual songs should cost no more than 50 cents, and albums should cost about $8 - the music industry owes that to me for the years I spent paying $18 for crappy CDs with one or two good songs.

By the way, for this story, I signed up for the $9.95 monthly subscription to Napster, and I'm going to keep it because I think it'll save me money over time. 

You don't have to subscribe to Napster - you can just buy songs and albums "a la carte" - but the subscription allows me to listen to many of those songs and albums before buying them. Otherwise, typical "a la carte" services, including iTunes, only let you listen to 30-second snippets.

Fun: Without question, Napster is more fun to use. Every time I log on, I find new features - there are dozens of radio stations, an online magazine, browsing engines that let me see what others are downloading or help me sample dozens of musical subgenres. To be fair, some fab features are available only to subscribers, but the excellent band and album information is available to all. 

The iTunes store seems more stingy with extras - the radio stations descriptions are cryptic, the band info isn't as extensive and the recommendation features seem somewhat halfhearted. Then again, iTunes does have, er, audiobooks. If that's your thing.

So who wins?

If you know exactly what you want and aren't that into browsing, try iTunes. If you want to browse and make musical discoveries and preview albums before buying them, Napster's subscription-plus-downloads model is for you.

If neither service appeals to you, it's worth remembering that there are other legal sites out there. I gave MusicMatch a quick try, but when my songs hadn't downloaded in half an hour, I gave up - yet my account was still charged $4.95 for music I never got. 

But some legal sites are getting it right, sort of. I'm going to give RealNetwork's excellent Rhapsody service another try later this year, after it adds a la carte downloads to its current subscription model. 

Even MTV is getting into the game early next year, according to news reports. 

Maybe it will end up with my download dollars, maybe Napster will - or maybe another service will come along and completely rock my world. I can dream, can't I?

Headline: Pulitzer winner Cruz to speak to students
Author: Heather Brummer / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Picture for a moment a man who spent his early years in Cuba. His father is arrested for trying to escape to give his family a better life, and his mother and grandmother are left to make ends meet. 

Would you envision his outcome as a success story? 

Nilo Cruz would, because the story just described is that of his own life. Cruz was raised in Cuba before coming to America at age nine, and saw firsthand what would one day become the setting for many of his works. 

In fact, he recently won the Pulitzer prize for "Anna in the Tropics" which tells the story of Cuban cigar workers in the 1920s and their desire to surround themselves with art and culture, even though most were poor and could not read.

On Dec. 5, FIU will welcome back playwright Cruz for his second visit to the campus. 

Cruz, who normally resides in the heart of theatre, New York, will read from "Anna in the Tropics" and discuss his works with the students in attendance. 

In the following telephone interview, Mr. Cruz answered questions related to his life and work. 

Q: You spent your early years in Cuba and that is a theme that has carried over into many of your plays. What was it about this time that was so influential to you? 

A: I was able to observe the Cuban people as a child and throughout my life. I have always seen the Cuban spirit as incredibly strong and it seems to me that the Cuban people tend to take what little resources they have and make them into something. I like the concept of "little people with big dreams."

Q: Strong, courageous women are another prominent feature in your works. Where does that come from? 

A:  The women in my family have always been certainly more articulate than the men. The women I have known throughout my life have always been extremely strong characters who accept the struggles of life and try to make life better for themselves and the people around them. That is where the strong female characters in my plays come from.

Q: Some artists believe they have a muse which serves as their inspiration. Who is your inspiration?

A: Well, my mother was the one who believed in me as an artist. She gave me a typewriter at a very young age and told me I was going to be a writer. She was right and I will always be grateful for that.

Q: Where would you like to see theatre in ten years?

A: I would like to see writers of many different backgrounds - I want to see plays from African American writers, Hispanic writers, Asian writers. I want to see more variety in the work. Theatre that is all encompassing, more multi-cultural, that is what I would like to see.

Q: Is there anything you would like to see more/less of in the artistic world?

A: I would like to see theatre that is less realistic. North American theatre tends to be a little too realistic at times - I would prefer work that is a little more magical and experimental. 

We have to remember that theatre is an art form and sometimes commercial theatres tend to keep the art from moving forward. 

The interest is in how much money they can make and this puts the control in the hands of the audience when, in reality, it should be in the hands of the artist.

Q: This is your second visit to FIU. What made you decide to return? 

A: I loved the first day I visited. The students were wonderful and I found the whole thing to be so inspirational, that's why I wanted to come back. 

Q:  What's your advice for students who might be interested in playwriting? 

A:  Go out and do everything you can. Don't limit yourself to writing - just get involved with theatre somehow, sweep, mop floors, hang lights. I did so much work in theatre before I actually became a writer. I even helped build a theatre out of a former cafeteria space at Brown University, when no one believed it would be successful. So do everything and don't give up your dream.

Q:  Can you tell us anything about your upcoming works?

A: I have a new play opening at the New Theatre in Coral Gables this January and I'm certainly looking forward to that. It is set in the south of Spain.

Q:  Is there anything you care to add?

A:  I'm just delighted to be coming back to Miami. It is where I took my first steps as an artist. It's great to be back and share my work with the community. 

"An Evening with Nilo Cruz" will take place  at 8 p.m. The event, which is sponsored by both the Student Government Association and the FIU Theatre Department, will commence with a reception outside the WPAC at 7:30 p.m. Everyone is welcome, but reservations are required. To reserve your place, call (305) 348-3789.

Headline: Top '03 films push cinematic diversity
Author: Robert J. Gramatages / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The cinematic class of '03 has had its share of disenchantments and pleasant surprises. To pick the top ten movies of the year is cumbersome but there has been such diversity in theatres that it is easier to simply name the best in each class. This year is all about illustrious expectations, movies in parts, jolts and chuckles.  

Great Expectations

The spring gave moviegoers a ray of big budget hope with "X2: X-Men United." It not only met the expectations of core fans; it managed to pull an even bigger audience. This gave everyone the hope of grander things for the summer. This overzealous summer preview season could be blamed for the series of box office mishaps that came to be. With let downs left and right ("The Hulk," "Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde") one movie emerged unscathed as the sleeper hit of the year, "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl." There were not many expectations for this movie which makes its success all the more refreshing.

Scary Movies

Thrill seekers were in their heyday this year. "28 Days Later" was goth (more so than "Gothika") and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" scarier that the original. Speaking of original, there was one remarkably original thriller that upped the game this year. "Identity" was both eluding and ingenious with its psychopathic story. The success of these three movies (both in the box office and the realm of popular opinion) proves that people love to have the piss scared out of them. 

Body Parts

This year has been all about tales told in parts (some more intriguing than others). The best parts of this year were the third and final installment of the El Mariachi trilogy, "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" and the first part of the epic "Kill Bill" saga.

"Kill Bill: Volume One" is cunning. Its killer humor and poetic fight sequences make "Kill Bill" a must this year.

"Once Upon a Time in Mexico" was not as insane as Bill but it was certainly a better conclusion than the Wachowski brothers provided with their anticlimactic and somewhat bewildering conclusion to the "Matrix." A great cast led by a cool director put Mexico on the cutting edge this year.

Fingers around the country will be crossed for this year's conclusion of the "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King". This final installment has much to live up to after last year's über successful "LOTR: The Two Towers".  

Funny Man

John Favreau's "Elf" is the finest of the funnies this year. This movie is a knee-slapping gut-busting good time. Buddy Elf is quite the character and only Will Ferrell could pull off the sugarplum-loving human in an elf's world that turns elf in a human's world. Ferrell is a force of nature, and this film lets him work his magic. 

The title match for the funniest of the year will be a tough one. The Farrelly brothers will attempt to dethrone Favreau with their so far-so funny "Stuck on You." 

The Others

There are two underdogs this year that showed up without all the hoopla but managed to gain a following by being good movies. Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's latest, deals with people, life and humor in a magnificent way. A bit melancholy but the mood is just right for this great film.  

Another pleasant surprise on the  alternatives list is "L'Auberge Espagnole." A group of international students dwelling in Barcelona experiences life in a unique setting. This film captures a great setting and does a better job than MTV's "The Real World" at telling the true story of seven strangers. 

The year is almost over but the studios are still pumping out the movies. Although Christmas usually brings those long sometimes boring introspective films, there is still much to look forward to. This year has been a whirlwind and  will probably continue to be so.

Subheadline:  
Author: CMari008@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
Dear Editor:

As a frequent reader of The Beacon, I thought I would take it upon myself to write to you in response to the guest appearance of Crashing Tide, a well known Miami local band, on Radiate 88 this last Sunday.  I will not lie; I never listen to the school's radio station, but I will tell you that I did listened to this whole two hour interview without even such an idea as a bathroom break. Never have I heard a more genuine and pleasant group with such music of professional caliber. Crashing Tide is very well known among the FIU student community because of all the shows they have played across campus for Greek organizations and different charities. On the top of my list is definitely their performance in the Golden Panther Arena, along side two other local acts as they together made the opening act for Ludacris last year. I was very impressed with the positive feedback given by your staff in the following weeks reviews.  I guess one may say that the purpose of this letter is to simply shine some well deserved light on a group of individuals who love what they do, and will stop at nothing to accomplish their goals and dreams. Radiate 88 has definitely found their undiscovered talent and FIU should be proud to have them amongst their student body. 

Thank You,

Subheadline:  
Author: ewetz001@fiu.edu
&nbsp;
Hello, my name is Ernie Wetzler. I am a first year law student at FIU and wanted to run a few ideas by y'all. First and foremost, when I was at Univ of GA for undergrad, we had a student newpaper called the red and black. Students read the paper for 2 reasons, to catch up on local and school news and to read various humor articles. I've looked at the paper off and on this semester and I have some ideas for a weekly humor article.

See, the red and black reserved one article for the paper each day to a student writer who could write about any topic they so decided. It could be something funny like the date a person had on campus the night before, or just a mere opinion on a new school program. 

i really believe the school paper could increase its readership and postive feedback if y'all expand your readership and allow studends in grad school, or in my case law school, to have a more active voice in the paper. Please email me at ewetz001@fiu.edu or bigern1935@yahoo.com if there is a possibility of there being a weekly humor/opinion article

Headline: Women's basketball routs Appalachian State
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers, led by forwards Dace Cinite and Milena Tomova, got their first win of the season with a convincing 72-53 win over Appalachian State on Nov. 28 at the Golden Panther Arena in the opening game of the FIU Thanksgiving Classic.

FIU opened the game with a 35-9 run as the game was over almost as fast as it started. FIU held the Mountaineers to 14 percent shooting (5-of-34) from the field in the first half and took a 40-13 lead into halftime.

"Our defense was very intense and we were able to jump out to a big lead because of that intensity," said head coach Cindy Russo.

FIU got most of its scoring from Cinite, who scored 12 points in the first half and finished the game with 18 on 8-of-14 shooting. 

Tomova struggled offensively, hitting only two of her nine shot attempts, but made up for it on the boards, collecting 15 rebounds, including six on the offensive end.

"Dace and Milena acted like leaders and that's what we were looking for from both of them," Russo said.

Guard Deniz Boz and forward Doursiel Moore chipped in with 11 and 10 points respectively, as two of four Golden Panthers in double figures. Boz also added six assists and contributed to 18 Mountaineer turnovers with three steals.

However, FIU had 18 turnovers of its own, but made up for it by getting to the free throw line 27 times, eight more than Appalachian State. FIU hit 18 of its 27 attempts at the line, compared to 10-of-19 for the Mountaineers.

With the strong defense and ability to get to the free throw line, Russo was impressed with the effort of her team.

"We played a real tough game, real steady and we were able to score some points, but we have to keep it up," Russo said.

Headline: Men's soccer advances to third round on PK's
Author: Steve Perhla /Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It all came down to one shot.

That was the only thing separating FIU from extending its season to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament or having it end abruptly on its home turf.

And it came down to sophomore midfielder Jared Rose, who stood 11 feet away, in the last of the fifth round of penalty shots with the score tied. 

And although it appeared Rose's shot was saved for a brief second, the ball deflected off Cal-State Northridge goalkeeper Radames Lafaurie and trickled into the net, sending the FIU Soccer Complex into pandemonium, as the Golden Panthers defeated the Matadors 6-5 in front of 591 fans on Nov. 26 to advance to the third round of the NCAA Tournament.

"The goalie guessed [correctly] and should have saved it, but I came out with a goal. I trained with goalkeepers a lot while I was growing up and I learned a technique to throw the keeper off. And I usually put it with enough power that even if [the goalkeeper guesses correctly], it'll go in," said Rose.

Rose's game-winner was set up by FIU senior goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg, who after allowing four consecutive goals in penalty kicks, made the biggest save of the season when he guessed correctly and dove left, saving Cal State midfielder Yossi Raz's attempt.

"I knew it was the last kick for them and being my senior year, I don't want to lose. I want to go all the way. The only way was to save that goal," said Rosenberg.

Added head coach Karl Kremser: "It's appropriate too in a way that Roy comes out and makes a save. He's been our most consistent player all year. He's worked so hard this year. Everytime we've needed something big from him, he's come through."

The game was played scoreless through 80 minutes, until FIU junior defender Zachary Peoples picked an opportune time to score his first goal of the season.

Off a rebound, Peoples blasted a low shot from just outside the penalty area to the right side of Lafaurie, giving the Golden Panthers a one-goal advantage with less than 10 minutes to play.

"The goal was nasty. Once I hit it, I knew it was in. I just took my shirt off...it was a feeling I can't describe. I just had butterflies in my stomach and it made me feel like I could fly," said Peoples.

But just over a minute later, Northridge silenced the capacity crowd when Big West Defensive Player of the Year  Edwin Miranda caught the FIU defense off guard and ripped a pass from freshman midfielder Gabriel Montoya past Rosenberg to tie the game at one.

FIU avoided near disaster in the closing minutes of regulation when Rosenberg made a series of season-saving saves, highlighted by a charging save on a one-on-one breakaway with less than five minutes to play.

After the regulation period concluded tied at one, both sides exchanged attacks in both 10-minute overtime periods, but neither team was able to score. FIU was outshot 5-0 in the first overtime, but Rosenberg recorded two saves to keep the Matadors scoreless.

In the second overtime period, FIU nearly stole a goal, when Northridge tried to clear the ball from inside its own goal area, but the attempt ricocheted off one of its own players and bounced directly off the top post.

Penalty kicks followed and FIU scored on all five attempts. Eythor Einarrson, Hendrix Emanuel, Lucas Scudeler and Johhny Pulido all buried their shots to set up Rose, who sealed the deal.

For FIU, it was just a matter of executing what it had worked on the whole season.

"Everyone made their penalty kicks because we've been practicing them all year and it paid off," Peoples said. "We all just took a deep breath and said let's do what we've been practicing."

With the victory, FIU advances to play defending champion UCLA on the road on Nov. 30. The Golden Panthers fell to the Bruins on the road last season, 1-0 in overtime.

"I feel fortunate to end up in the same bracket as UCLA, because I wouldn't want it any other way. We know now that if we want to win it all, we have to beat the defending champion," Peoples said. "It's a challenge we're looking forward to."

Headline: Men's basketball wins two of three; FAU, Miami up next
Author: Harry Coleman/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Nov. 23- FIU 66, Quinnipiac 65

After shooting 61 percent from the line in the game, it was ironic that the Golden Panthers held on to a victory due to clutch free throws. With 8.4 seconds left, forward Harry Lum hit a pair of free throws to give FIU a 66-65 victory over Quinnipiac at the Golden Panther Arena Nov. 23 to claim the consolation game of the FIU/Hampton Inn Tip-Off Classic.

"This was a clutch and needed test for us," said head coach Donnie Marsh. "We have a bunch of kids who haven't played together long and they are a bunch of kids who haven't experienced a win and we needed to feel that.

Lum led all scores with 20 points and nine rebounds. Point guard Marcus Robinson finished the game with 16 points and also earned All-Tournament honors.

The game went back and fourth with both teams exchanging leads. At half time, the Bobcats led FIU 29-28 after a couple of free throws by Rashaun Banjo. Even with the Bobcats leading at the half, FIU played excellent defense by forcing Quinnipiac to shoot 29 percent from the floor in the first half. 

In the second half, the Bobcats led by five with 8:26 to play, but after a couple of key free throws by Lum and a slum dunk, FIU led 64-63.

Qunnipiac took back the lead on a fast-break lay-up by Craig Benson, who was also fouled on the play. He missed the free throw with 24 seconds to play, leading 65-64. Lum was then fouled and hit the key free throws for the victory.

Banjo, who finished the game with 17 points and 10 rebounds, led the Bobcats, who were a preseason favorite to win the Northeast Conference.

However, it was Lum that made quite a statement in only his second game as a Golden Panther.

"Making the free throws helped us win the game, which was a great victory for us," said Lum.

Nov. 25- GWU 76, FIU 67

Even the return of Carlos Morban and Taurance Johnson could not help the Golden Panthers as they lost to Colonials 76-67 on Nov. 25 in Washington, D.C.

Morban scored a career high 27 points and Johnson added 19, but it was not enough as George Washington was ignited with a spark off the bench as Pops Mensah-Bonsu added a team-high 20 points, 14 coming from the free throw line.

GWU came out strong in the first half, beginning the game on a 14-0 run. FIU would not score until 14:44 left in the half on a layup by Morban. 

The Golden Panthers shot 37.5 percent from the field in the first half.

"We didn't make the plays we are supposed to do and against the pressure they went up on the 14-0 run," said Morban.

FIU closed the gap to seven at the start of the second half, 36-29, but only to be followed by a 19-6 Colonial run to put GWU up 55-35 with 12:51 to go in the game.

But Morban scored 20 second half points and FIU closed the gap 60-57 with 5:39 to play on a basket by Johnson, but that was as close as FIU would get.

GWU began to pull away on clutch free throws and sent FIU home with a loss.

FIU did outscore GWU 43-41 in the second half, but it was not enough to overcome the first half difficulties.

Marcus Robinson, FIU's leading scoring prior to the game, only scored four points. 

One of last years leading scorers, Junior Matias, had a rough game going 1-of-7 from the field.

"I did not play good at all in this game. We need to play more consistent because it was just real hard pressure for us. What we learned in this game is the need to come out and play hard at the beginning," said Robinson.

Nov. 29- FIU 81, N. Florida 72

Led by three players in double figures, the Golden Panthers defeated North Florida 81-72, the first of two Division II schools the team will face this season, on Nov. 29 at the Golden Panther Arena.

However, head coach Donnie Marsh was not satisfied with the performance of his team.

"We will take it because it was a win. I certainly did not like the way we started and the way we ended. We did not finish with a lot of intensity and confidence," said Marsh who added his team needs to step up its play in the upcoming games.

FIU led by nine, 23-14, with nine minutes to go in the first half, but began to play sloppy and the Ospreys followed with a 10-0 run to put North Florida up 24-23.

Carlos Morban pumped up the crowd scoring five quick points to give FIU a 29-24 lead. Junior Matias followed with a pair of three pointers from the left perimeter to give FIU the lead going into halftime, 38-31.

Scoring 38 points in the first half was a big step for FIU as they were averaging 28 points in the first half of games this season.

"We just need to come and attack people more instead of turning the ball over so much," said forward Taurance Johnson. 

But FIU ran away in the second half. A three pointer by Marcus Robinson on an assist by Morban gave the Golden Panthers their biggest lead of the night at 20, putting FIU up 65-45.

Morban, who was suspended for the first two games of the season, led all scorers with 23 points. He also finished the game 9-of-12 from the field, along with six assists. 

"He has come back with a great deal of confidence for us which has really helped us out," said Marsh.

"He has been our man these past two games and we just need to feed off him because he is playing really well," said Matias, who chipped in with 20 points.

North Florida would not give up after being down by 20. They followed with a 16-4 run to tighten the game at 77-70 after a three pointer by Danny Lotz, who led the Osprey with 19 points and nine rebounds.

Both teams later exchanged buckets only for FIU to pull away on a basket by Morban. 

"Our guys thought that it was over and that they were going to go away, but they [UNF] did a nice job coming back. We just have to go back and work on a few things and we'll be a better team," said Marsh.

FIU next plays at FAU Dec. 1, then visit the Miami Hurricanes Dec. 6.

"A victory would be great for us to have the bragging rights in the city for a year," said Lum.

Headline: Commentary: Quite a season for a team that wasn't supposed to be around
Author: Daniel Izquierdo/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Maybe this is the type of 'futbol' we should play at FIU. The type that pits two teams against each other so heatedly that one goal, one header coming off a corner kick can prove as insurmountable as Mount Everest. Not like someone diving at the pylon for six, that is nearly not as difficult to overcome.

The men's soccer team pulled off a 6-5, double-overtime-penalty-kick filled victory Wednesday night over Cal-State Northridge that sent that quaint stadium into a frenzy. Probably never has FIU had a crowd that electric, enthusiastic and into every play of a game. The crowd of nearly 600 cheered and harassed the opponent, celebrated and sulked. 

This story beats most any other in sports. For this simple reason: This team was not supposed to exist. Through this university's brief history, soccer has been its most successful program. Baseball has come on of late, but soccer has won championships, conquering Division II national championships in '82 and '84.

In 1996 they were the runner-up in Division I, losing the title game to St. John's 4-1.

So, this team has history and tradition. 

But the university had decided to ax soccer in lieu of "inflationary factors impacting our budget." When all the factors - Title IX, sparse revenue coming in and the Sun Belt Conference not offering it as a sport - were considered, Athletic Director Rick Mello and university officials decided to release the program. Then, two days later, decided to reinstate it on a provisional two-year plan.

Well if you were at that game, you would have seen that Mello was the most excited spectator on hand. He leaped into head coach Karl Kremser's arms after the victory, feet off the ground, squeezing with real emotion. Mello knows how special this team is, but now needs to find a way to make sure it stays right where it is.

FIU men's soccer has become the greatest feel-good story this side of Pro Player Stadium and lovable ole' Jack McKeon. 

While the Marlins were simply not on a level playing field with large revenue-streaming teams, FIU was axed for not drawing enough profit. 

The Marlins were struggling through injuries to their pitching staff. FIU was struggling for the opportunity to blame injury. Marlins general manager Larry Beinfest was on the telephone trying to hammer out a deadline deal that would bolster their roster. Kremser was on the phone with Mello trying to create the opportunity to bolster his attendance once practice broke.

So, while the Marlins were figuratively not supposed to be there, FIU soccer literally was not. 

The Marlins are paid professionals. They're not a bunch of college kids that could have easily folded when news hit about their cancellation.

So while the student body embraced their success with a celebrity-like flood towards the bleachers' railing for hand shakes, or while defender Zachary Peoples stood there with a smile the size of Miami-Dade and a his blue sheer undershirt dripping wet, it was clear this team has made it.

While game-winning goal-scorer Jared Rose quietly spoke about his feat, stumbling to find the right words at times, Rosenberg could barely manage to speak between attempts to catch his breath. And Kremser, the nonchalant, even-keeled leader of this team, actually cracked a slight smile - giving a priceless hint of satisfaction before addressing the media.

I know it was close to 10 p.m., but all this team needed was a setting sun and a white stallion to go with the scene on the night before Thanksgiving - a true hero's send off out west. 

 And even if they don't knock off UCLA, they still picked up two postseason wins.

Two wins they were never supposed to be in position to receive anyways.

Headline: Date rape cards good idea, but more research needed
Author: Javier Ruiz / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
A proposed program to purchase date-rape drug test cards might be beneficial to students, but the involved parties - Student Government Association and the Victim's Advocacy Center - should be sure to do their research before following through.
Drink Safe Labs is the manufacturer of SAF date rape cards. The credit-card-sized cards, when subjected to a drop of liquid, test for GHB and Ketamine, two of the most commonly used date rape drugs.

The company, which has initiated programs with Barry University and Florida Atlantic University, approached FIU with their product, according to Nicaise Parillon, Biscayne Bay Student Government Council president. Currently, negotiations are under way which would purchase 3,000 of the cards at $1 a piece.

The cards, in principle would seem a good way of preventing the spiking of drinks that often ends in date rape, and precedent exists with the distribution of condoms at the Health Care and Wellness Center, a service that many students have taken advantage of with positive results.

So where's the rub? Using them is an awkward proposition. Testing a drink is an action more fitting a lab than a crowded bar and, to be sure, makes for an uncomfortable silence during a date.

And besides, a drink can be spiked after it's been tested.

Not that it's a bad idea. Condoms aren't foolproof either, but more often than not, they prevent unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 

But there are still question marks. Would women use them? And if they did, would the project produce results? At a potential cost of $3,000, the answers to both those questions should be yes.

To their credit, SGA and VAC are already looking at the frequency of on-campus date rape incidents to gauge the need for the program. But they should go beyond that; they should poll students on whether they would actually make use of the service, they should increase awareness on preventing date rape - after all, a product that provides a false sense of security might be detrimental - and they should take a look at how similar programs at FAU and Barry have worked out.

It's a good idea. But many good ideas turn out to be bad in practice, and at a cost of $3,000, not taking every step to ensure that the money is well spent is unacceptable.

Headline: Thankless on thanksgiving: A multitude of blessings for a secular generation
Author: Hans Zeiger/Knight Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
Of all the holidays in the year, Thanksgiving is perhaps most incompatible with the moral dispositions of Generation Y. 

It is not that we refuse to partake of the turkey and mashed potatoes, nor that we refrain from watching the football games on television. Rather, we are ungrateful for most everything we have. 

We are a thankless generation.

I may sound like a pessimist, but my premise is basically positive. 

My generation is materially blessed beyond what any other generation before us has ever had. 

A typical, middle-class 18-year-old is endowed with a fairly new car with a fancy stereo system, a cell phone, his own television, a college education paid for by his parents and the government, access to fast food 24 hours a day, a laptop computer with Internet access, a ticket to the R-rated movie on Friday night, cultural license to engage in gratuitous sex, political license to attain an abortion and social independence whereby he or she can easily avoid the constraints of organized religion.

Run-on sentences are discouraged, but run-on blessings are taken for granted by Gen Y. 

We have the right to entertainment, the right to the pill, the right to feel good about ourselves, the right to employment, the right to education, the right to file lawsuits, the right to health care, the right to forsake intellectual matters and the right to hate spiritual matters. 

Obviously, it is not because we are deprived of anything to be grateful for that an entire generation lacks the distinguishing features of heartfelt thanks giving. 

Instead, it is just the opposite.

The vast abundance of material wealth, opportunity, fun and enjoyment at our disposal is seen as nothing more than the product of our own mighty existence.

As a result, we are a selfish generation that presumes it is enough to thank ourselves for being alive by seeking the various instant gratifications available to be consumed. 

The problem is not that we have nothing to be thankful for. The problem is that we have forgotten whom to thank. In short, we have forgotten God.

Only 30 percent of American high-school seniors consider religion very important, according to the 2002 National Study of Youth and Religion conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina. 

That leaves 70 percent of us not caring about the source of our blessings. 

In a proclamation of thanksgiving to Congress, Abraham Lincoln wrote: 

"We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthen us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us!" 

Thanksgiving is a religious holiday, but as with most religious things, our culture has demeaned it into a celebration of secularism. 

Of the 4.5 million occurrences of the word "thanksgiving" on a Google search, fewer than 1 million have "God" in the context. 

The words "food" and "turkey" appear with far more regularity than the name of God in shared hits with "thanksgiving." The only alternative to thanking God is selfishness. 

Today, it is rare that we even take time to consider that America's blessings of prosperity, freedom, justice, peace and opportunity are gifts from a mighty and gracious God.

Headline: America's sweatshop workers in need of a voice
Author: Alexander Blanco/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
I work at an All-American sweatshop, one of the last of its kind. Now, if you were about to say that there are none this side of Cambodia, well then, you are mistaken. Tell it to my boss, he'll laugh you right out of your faith in the generosity of folks. He's got a mean laugh too, so I wouldn't recommend it.

At times, usually after my morning showers but before my first sip of stale coffee, I ask myself how this came to be. How is it that I - a college student done with the credit portion of his study and only in need of passing the CLAST exam to be presented with the manila leaflet that will ensure at least consideration in today's job market - have accepted employment in a place less suitable for the earning of wage than the slaughtering of mules? 

The only answer I can find is that I was financially desperate, am financially desperate, for the last couple of months of this existence so as to deem working hard labor a convenience and not a hassle. And desperate I remain. Bills are made for the paying, and if I do not want to see myself become a burden to my folks, I need to pay them. Filial bonds can go a long way but are made of a kind of rope that can tighten and noose up on you. So I try not to outstay my welcome on that account, and take another sip of stale coffee.

Then I look back at my roster of previous jobs and I see something kin in each and every one of them. I have worked at flea markets, Hialeah factories and at Opa Locka factories. 

The best position I have held was as a gopher for a hereby-nameless production team that had me shuttling amplifiers, sub-woofers and switchboards all over South Beach and Coconut Grove to studios and nightclubs. 

Working in places where others skirt their day-to-day toil for a salient dose of entertainment can be a weary endeavor and soon you can find yourself directing indecent imaginings toward your patrons. Needless to say, I do not work for them anymore.

No, I work at a sweatshop with illegal immigrants, ranging in age from fifteen to fifty, who do not speak a word of English. And I hate it.

Needless to say, by this time my cup of coffee is at the dregs and tasting nothing like a taster's choice. 

Now, being an English major at FIU and of the open-minded variety, I do not condemn anyone or anything for my current state of welfare. I am so open-minded that I do not even blame myself. I can leave the job anytime I want and damn the consequences. We can all do that, can't we? We all have the final authority - hell, final obligation! - on what we do with our allotted time. But it is telling that we do not, cannot, abide by abandoning a soiled something for a crystalline nothing. We revert to default mode and do as we are told, la di da.

Except I, unlike my fellow laboring colleagues, can do something about it. No, not protest or strike for higher wages, they would as soon be rounded up and herded to the Mexican border as call attention to themselves; that is simply something they cannot do. 

Shame is an overriding factor in working at a sweatshop. This is what these people feel, as if they have done something wrong in trying to earn a buck in the land of plenty. Milk and honey comes with a price, after all.

But I can do what these laborers cannot. I can write about it. I can write what you are reading. I can reach an audience, however truant according to some, much larger than they can so as to offer a caveat to all of the unworried slackers, apostolic alcoholics, and diarrheic dilettantes of the world. 

What I have to say is this: 

Avoid the road less traveled unless you are able, ready, and willing to accept where it may lead: Inferno, Purgatorio, or Paradiso. For some, this path only leads to an extended vacation in a life less lived, which is not saying much. 

 But don't let that bother you. I sure don't. Bitter coffee tastes great.

Headline: FTAA coverage sensationalist, inaccurate
Author: Virginia C. Cornett/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
I participated in the large, well-organized FTAA protest march in downtown Miami on Nov. 20th and in the Gala for Global Justice the previous evening. 

There were over 10,000 people involved in the march. Many of them were middle-aged Americans who came all the way from Wisconsin or Indiana or even Canada to join forces with their fellow Union members or special interest groups. There were quite a few older people there as well - the kinds you'd expect to see as greeters at Wal-Mart rather than at a demonstration against corporate greed. There were people of many colors and ethnic backgrounds. And, of course, there were the dreadlocked kids in battered Converse sneakers withtie-dyed shirts and multiple body piercings.

Some people carried signs that read "Fair Trade for Healthy Communities," not "Free Trade for Corporate Profits" or "FTAA Sucks." Some groups wore matching t-shirts to show their solidarity. A scattered few chanted rhymes such as "FTAA, No Way!" or the old protest standard "The People United Will Never Be Divided!" And some said nothing, carried no signs and wore no uniforms, but marched alongside those who did to support a cause they believed in enough to take time out of their lives and money out of their pockets to attend. I was one of those. 

And as this peaceful, even spiritual, demonstration wound through the streets, with police armored from head-to-toe in riot gear lining the streets in a wall of power, there seemed to be a grand sense of purpose. We all knew why we were there and were even giddy with enthusiasm in being able to express ourselves in this very public forum. 

As this mass of people snaked through the streets, I kept thinking how beautiful it was all going to look on television. How the news choppers would be able to capture the beautiful image of all these people from different countries and workplaces and backgrounds linking arms through the streets. The vastness of it all would look spectacular on the local news, filling the screen from edge to edge with this living work of art and of democracy in action.

When I got home, I flipped channels from CBS to NBC to ABC and even tried FOX, anxious to see the demonstration from a different vantage point and to share it with Miami and the world. Every time one station took a break, I flipped to another. Coverage on some stations was non-stop until 7 p.m. 

But my artistic vision never materialized. All that was talked about ad nauseum, all the footage that was shown, from one channel to the next, were the clashes with the police and the anarchists setting a garbage dumpster on fire and long-haired protesters getting pelted with rubber bullets and pepper spray. There were live aerial shots of protesters with handkerchiefs covering their mouths and noses, tossing rocks and garbage at the police wall. There were the reporters interviewing witnesses with handcuffed protesters lined up on their knees along the wall in the background. Even the storylines in the next day's Miami Herald read "Cautious police blow up a can of paint" and "Miami streets calm this afternoon as tensions ebb." Nearly all of the photos on the Herald's website showed fists raised in anger or a bloodied face or a handcuffed kid in a black t-shirt. 

I need to know, where were the photos of the grandparents and steelworkers and lawyers and teachers and college students and religious leaders with whom I walked for nearly two hours? What about that assembly at the amphitheatre with the color-blocks of union members nodding their heads in agreement with the speakers? Where was the video showing musicians on the stage singing "Time Has Come Today" with the crowd on their feet, swaying and singing along? What about the downtown Miami residents gathered in small groups along the streets cheering us on, saying "thank you" and telling us "the eyes of the world are upon you"? Where were the candid shots of police officers, so intimidating and somber, giving the occasional nod and smile as we said "We're marching for you, too." 

But instead, the most common thing people ask me when they hear I was at the march was "Did you get tear-gassed?" Why would I get tear-gassed? Neither I nor the 10,000 people around me did anything to initiate such a response from the police. But that is all they saw on the news. Did I dream it all? If I rely only on the information presented by the local television stations and newspapers, I would have to believe that I had been sleepwalking through the streets of Miami on Thursday. 

Of course there were people there with the goal to cause trouble - and they did exactly that. But for the grand preponderance of the media coverage to revolve around that minority is grossly misleading to the viewing and reading public. 

Maybe I'm being naïve to suggest that "if you ignore it, it will go away" but perhaps there is some validity to that. If the rock-throwers don't get the coverage they desire by causing trouble, maybe they will find a different, more peaceful tactic. Unfortunately, however, I fear that the same such scenario will play out for those who want to see real change and are willing to fight for it on legal and righteous grounds and they will feel their actions are futile and democracy in action will shrivel up and die. I'm afraid they will crawl back under the covers and never come out and that would be the true end to democracy in America.

Survey finds strong support for university funding 

According to a poll released by the State University Presidents Association on Nov. 24, 80 percent of Floridians oppose cutting budgets for public university funding.

The survey was conducted by the Florida Center for Public Policy at the University of North Florida. More than 1,0000 Florida residents were contacted between Oct. 16-26 for the survey.

The poll found strong support for higher education and a concern among residents that inadequate state funding may hurt the quality of programs and access to universities.

The survey found that 70 percent of Floridians are somewhat concerned that their child or family member will not have access to higher education in the next 20 years.

The survey found that 75 percent of the state's residents believe universities are very important to the Florida workforce. 85 percent of residents also said that universities were important to enhancing research and tehnology.

"Floridians clearly understand that a college degree is the key to a better life," said FIU President Modesto A. Maidique. "And everyone wants access to a better future."

 INTERNATIONAL

Number of U.S. students studying abroad continues to grow

Despite terrorism, a slack economy at home and upheavals overseas, U.S. college students are packing their suitcases and going overseas to study in ever increasing numbers.

A record 160,920 students took credit courses abroad in the 2001-2002 school year, according to data just compiled. That was 4.4 percent more than the previous year and more than double the number a decade before.

The numbers come in the latest annual report on study abroad, prepared by the Washington-based Institute for International Education released Nov. 17.

In the latest year, the United Kingdom was, as usual, the students' favorite destination. Spain rose a notch to take second place, pushing Italy down to third.

"Less traditional countries" - China, Japan, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Brazil and Thailand - were among those registering the biggest increases in U.S. students, the report says.

New York University led the list in numbers of students studying overseas with 1,872. Michigan State University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania and Georgetown University followed in order.

But smaller colleges such as Carleton, Dickinson, Kalamazoo, Marlboro, St. Olaf and Union sent the greatest proportions of their students - more than 80 percent in all of those cases.

The institute said a spot survey this fall suggests that the number of U.S. students studying in other countries continues to grow.
