Here is a copy of letter that I sent 10/19 to the contact person for Panther Dining Services about Pollo Tropical operations. Many students, patrons and I were grossed out at how the condiments we use were laid out for us to use. I hope you can use your influence to change their practices and prevent people from getting sick. Thank you.

Subject:  Sanitation at Pollo Tropical Graham Center

Hi, I am wrtiting to comment/complain about an operation at Pollo Tropical in 
the GC. Overall the service is terrific, but they have started a new procedure 
where you get your own condiments such as salsa, sauces, salad dressing etc. 
The problem is, is that they are in open containers in a high traffic area. I 
observed many people talking, coughing over and touching the insides of 
containers. As a nursing student here at FIU I know this is a very easy way to 
spread many infections beginning with Hepatitis A & E. I would like to bring 
this to your attention, because many of us students here are upset with the 
lack of sanitation, which also looks very gross, is putting us at risk. Thank 
you.

Headline: Rugby club offers an experience in 'organized chaos'
Author: Zachary Duarte / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Walking through the halls,  many students can see flyers to join a rugby club. Most just rush by it, but for the few who actually try it out, it is a sports experience like no other.

Rugby is known as the father sport to football. Most of football's scoring system is based around the rugby scoring system. 

During a regular rugby game, each side has 15 players, so there are a total number of 30 players on the field. The game does not stop unless someone on the field commits a penalty. Otherwise, the clock keeps ticking. 

But, during the summer, the rugby club offers a tournament which features seven players on each side of the field inorder to make the game more athletic and less physical. 

Ranked number one last fall in Florida, the rugby club is getting ready to open their fall season but are looking for new additions to their team. Playing a St. Patrick's Day  tournament in Georgia and playing against schools such as Florida State University are only part of the traveling the club does throughout the year. 

Starting in October, the club is looking to start practicing on University Park Recreational Field on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. 

Rugby is not like any other sport - in terms of equipment, because all you need are shoes, shorts and a t-shirt to practice in. No pads, no helmets or specialized shoes. 

"We can teach you the basics, but most of the practicing is up to the player," said rugby coach Gerard Ferraris. 

Davin Monroe, player and the team's match secretary described rugby as "organized chaos." 

The team welcomes all types of people looking for a sport to play, to have fun or looking for a serious challenge sport. 

FIU's rugby club is part of the USA Rugby Union and plays not only collegiate teams, but men's teams all around southern parts of the U.S., and they sometimes combine with Miami's men's rugby team. The club has been around for four years now and is looking to grow in numbers. 

To learn more about rugby online go to www.360ruby.com and to learn more about the sport itself, check out the team live at practice or at their first home game on Oct. 22 at 2 p.m. at the Recreational Field.

Headline: New Heat roster good on paper, but will it deliver on court?
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Pat Riley sat three rows up during Game 7 of last year's Eastern Conference Finals. What was he thinking as he looked down and watched his project collapse before his very eyes? 

What did he think when he saw Damon Jones hoist two points the entire night and turn the ball over countless times? 

What did he think when he saw our defense get battered by the versatility of the Pistons frontcourt?

Whatever it was, it sure brought a lot of changes to the locker room and a whole new makeup for this season.

Mixed feelings strike the average Miami native as they look at the roster for the 2005-2006 Heat season.  

Despite how badly we want to be excited and how great it feels to see so many household names on paper, we can't help but feel a little resentment.

We are constantly reminded of all the would-be great teams that had so many big names but couldn't pull it together.  

These teams serve as examples of what can go wrong when too many personalities wear one uniform.

Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade and Stan Van Gundy return to a Heat team that is filled with talent, experience and explosive personalities.  

In Jason Williams, the "Diesel" has a point guard that runs the floor faster than he can say, "down here!"

In Antoine Walker, Stan Van Gundy has someone who was kicked off the Boston Celtics and holds the single season record for the most attempted three-pointers in a single season.

In Gary Payton, Wade gets the same point guard that got torched by Chauncey Billups two years ago in the finals, which lead to a complete demise of the championship Lakers.

With all these personalities mixed together; Stan Van Gundy has to throw on his lab coat and put together the perfect formula to make this team work.

Despite all this scrutiny, teammates - especially Shaq - are really excited about the possibility of a championship.

"I think Pat did a great job of getting better, stronger, more [experienced] players. He's always been great (at making personnel moves). I've always called him a 'Mini Jerry West,'" O'Neal said to the Miami Herald. "He did a great job. Now, we just have to go out and get it done. We were very close, but not close enough last year. I think this year, if we play in another close game like that, we can pull it out."

Many questions have been raised and some say that Riley may have tinkered too much with a good thing.

The Heat did have a lot of players injured during the final weeks of the season: Udonis Haslem had a bad thumb, O'Neal had his thighs bruised and Wade messed up his ribs in Game 5 versus the Pistons.

Were the Heat really one thigh and rib away from winning it all or was the makeup of the team not even close to a finished project?

Many questions are surfacing but the answers won't come until June. That is when we will find out if this was a mere collection of great players or a team built for success.

Headline: Women's soccer star seeks to top Sun Belt
Author: Joshua Rey / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On a women's soccer team that includes 16 returning letter winners, Janet Liguori has emerged as an unsung hero. The 5'3" senior forward leads the Golden Panthers with four goals thisseason and is making the Sun Belt Conference take notice.

Liguori ranks fifth in the conference in shots, scored fourth in shots per game and is tied for ninth in goals. But it is her leadership on the field which has FIU believing it can win the SBC in 2005.

A native Canadian, Liguori began playing soccer at age 11 and achieved much success in her homeland. She led the Oakville Storm Club team to the Ontario Cup final in 2000 and played semi-professional soccer with the Toronto Lady Lynx this past offseason. 

Liguori started her college career at Syracuse before transferring to FIU in time for her sophomore year. She is pursuing a double major in international relations and geography, and hopes to visit Barcelona, Spain someday. 

But first, she looks forward to spending four November days in Mobile, Alabama, where Liguori and the Golden Panthers hope to build off their 2004 SBC runner-up finish and win the conference.

Q: What did you do for fun growing up in Canada?

Soccer took up a lot of time, but I was able to experience a typical childhood life: Going to the movies with friends and other extracurricular activities. 

Q: Is soccer popular in Canada?

Yes it is, as far as club. High school is not well developed but club, yes.

Q: As a three-sport athlete in high school, was it difficult choosing to pursue soccer in college?

In track I was always good, but not good enough to pursue it at a Division I college, and basketball was just something for fun. [Soccer] was always the love of my life. I took it very seriously and worked extremely hard because that's where my talent excelled the most.

Q: How was life like at Syracuse?

Syracuse was a big time American university. It was actually a bit of a shock to me. I didn't know what to expect. It didn't work for me there, so I decided to transfer to FIU, which I had been previously recruited and was one of my options while choosing a university. I love the program here. Everton [Edwards] is a great coach.

Q: The last two years the team has had a lot of success playing at home. What's the biggest difference between playing at home and on the road?

At home we definitely have a very supportive fan base. Sometimes we have the weather to our advantage, whereas other teams coming here can't deal with the humidity. And playing on our field, which we practice on everyday, is a [confidence] booster for us. We feel comfortable.

Q: Entering last year's SBC tournament as the No. 4 seed, was the team especially motivated to prove you were better than that?

Yes. We had gotten together before the tournament to discuss our aspiring goals of success.  It showed on the field; our unity off the field.

Q: In the semifinal against Middle Tennessee, you scored an early goal and the game was decided on penalty kicks. What were your emotions as you watched MTSU's final shot?

It was really nerve- wracking, but as soon as they missed the shot, it was all bliss from there. We won and were going through to the final match.

Q: How did you handle that loss in the last 10 seconds against North Texas last year?

You're beside yourself. You worked so hard and it's all over in seven seconds. But you have to remind yourself to stay strong and that there is always next year to reach your goals.

Q: Does that result still motivate you?

Yes, definitely. It creates a rival with North Texas and it intensifies our hunger to win.

Q: You, Janessa Taddei and Valerie Patrick were named to the SBC All-Tournament Team last year. With all three of you returning, along with 13 others, how has one year helped the team mature?

We have a good nucleus of players returning. We have eight seniors this year and in the offseason everyone worked really hard in their preparations, keeping that unity from last year and carrying it over to this season, which has helped us mature as players individually and as a team.

Q: This season the team has had four ties. What are your feelings after you've played 110 minutes and have to settle for a tie?

It's unsatisfying and very disappointing, but you have to look at your game, figure out where you went wrong, fix it and move on to the next one.

Q: As the team's leading scorer, how would you describe the rush of scoring a goal to someone who's never played soccer before?

I guess for someone who isn't an athlete, it feels like winning the lottery.

It honestly is sheer happiness, elation and magic. You've done your job and ... well, you've seen the celebrations.  

Q: Last weekend, FIU played conference leaders North Texas and Denver tough, losing by one goal in each game. What separates FIU from those teams at this point of the season? 

Honestly, it just came down to scoring goals. We had most of the possessions for both games and we just got unlucky with our finishing. That's what it comes to, who puts the ball away.

Q: What will happen if FIU meets North Texas or Denver in the SBC tournament?

I'm positive we'll see them again and beat them.

Q: On Nov. 5, when the final is played, will FIU be on the field?

That is a goal of mine, my team's and my coaches'.   

Q: When your senior year is through, what are you going to miss the most?

Everything from traveling on the weekends, going to meetings and other scheduled events, to practice two hours a day in the hot sun - all of the things that are required of me as a student athlete,  both [the] good and bad. It all comes down to the essence of playing in a match and having fun.

Subheadline: Faculty Club student lounge moves to noisy third floor, brings controversy
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Students stood in hour-long lines at the Biscayne Bay Campus bookstore in order to purchase study guides and textbooks, but when the time came to crack them open, students were forced out of the Student Lounge located in the Wolfe University Center room 245, where most used the space for study purposes.

Between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., on Mondays through Thursdays, students are not allowed to use this designated area where students once studied in private. But setting up extends the waiting time for students eager to get in.

It is no longer the small quiet room filled with wooden furniture and comfy couches which students were accustomed to. The chairs and couches have been replaced with a steamer buffet station and cash register. The smell of food is stuck to the walls and will probably take several cans of Lysol to remove. Now, the Faculty Club, which was once lost and had nowhere to meet, gathers there for lunch. 

The Student Government Association at BBC requested that the wooden furniture and couches be moved to the T.V. lounge on the third floor of the WUC. Not only are students who study there inconvenienced by passerbys but the noise and music from the first floor can reach them. Many BBC students, like senior Selam Tesfamariam, feel displaced in their own territory. 

"This is terrible. We're so close to all the noise," Tesfamariam said.

BBC doesn't offer a handful of places to study and relax. That room was unique because it was closed-in, had large windows that provided dim lighting to study and the loudest noise was a whisper from a neighbor asking to borrow a highlighter.Vice Provost Raul Moncarz stated that the Faculty Club will continue to meet at the Student Lounge until the university funds another meeting room.

Students pay tuition and an extensive amount of fees; it is only fair to have a quiet area to relax and have a break from the daily stresses of the college life.

Headline: Hurricanes underlined need to explore all U.S. energy reserves
Author: H. Sterling Burnett / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
Hurricane's Katrina and Rita have highlighted a problem that policymakers have for too long ignored. From an energy perspective, we have put too many of our eggs in one very fragile basket - the Gulf of Mexico. 

For years politicians have whistled past the graveyard of America's energy security and economic prosperity. Praying every year that the ports, refineries, and oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are not too badly damaged during the annual hurricane season, while simultaneously limiting other options: banning economically viable new oil and gas production off of most of the U.S. coastline and by passing laws which limit oil refining capacity, and discourage the building of new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals and refineries.

As a result, nearly 30 percent of the United States' off-shore oil production, almost half of the country's refining capacity, approximately 20 percent of the off-shore natural gas production and more than 60 percent of our crude oil imports are produced in, flow through or are transformed to gasoline and other uses in the tropical storm ridden Gulf of Mexico. 

The folly of this policy will remain evident as American's go to the pump and heat and cool their homes for some time to come. Despite the fact that coal is America's most abundant fossil fuel and new technologies are reducing the pollution from coal fired power plants, during the 1990's the Clinton administration, with many states following suit, promoted natural gas as the electric power source of the future. At the same time, the administration kept much of North America's abundant natural gas fields on public lands and off-shore closed to development. In the Rocky Mountain region, an estimated 40 percent or 137 TCF of all the natural gas in the ground is off limits.

In addition, exploration and development of another 52 TCF of natural gas off of the East and West coasts has been banned. So while demand skyrocketed, domestic supplies of natural gas leveled off and even began to decline. 

The result: sharp increases in the price of natural gas. Of course, until recently, the only places considered for new natural gas production and LNG terminals were in the Gulf of Mexico - right in hurricane alley!

Concerning oil, there has been a moratorium on new oil and gas development and production off the coasts of California, the East Coast and much of Florida since 1990. While short-sighted, the ban faced relatively little opposition. Few politicians were willing to fight the very vocal environmental lobby at a time when supplies seemed abundant and prices were relatively low. These conditions no longer exist and today the policy just seems foolish. Even the energy bill enacted in August only expanded production in the Gulf, continuing restrictions on new production in other coastal areas. 

Will we learn the lessons of Katrina and Rita or will the political power of environmental elites continue to trump the energy needs of the country? And then there is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). According to the Energy Information Agency, ANWR contains between 6 and 16 billion barrels of oil under its frozen expanse. Even if only 6 billion barrels of oil are recovered, it equals all of our imports for nearly two years. 

With new oil technologies, we could deliver this oil from an area just over 2,000 acres in size, less than 1 percent of ANWR's 19 million acres, with little or no effect on the surrounding wildlife.   

We are not running out of oil or natural gas, at least not in the near future. But rising demand and political roadblocks have made supplies of oil, gas and gasoline temporarily scarce. 

This problem will not be solved overnight. However, proposals in Congress to allow states to share in the wealth should they allow new oil and gas development off of their coasts, and to expand refining capacity beyond the Gulf would, in the mid-term, help prevent future gaps in supply and demand from occurring when Mother Nature roars in the Gulf. Future Americans would be grateful.

Headline: Breezeway Cafe extended 24 hours
Subheadline: If students do not take advantage of new hours, hours may change 
Author: Grace Taylor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students living at University Park campus can now visit the Breezeway Cafe at any hour of the day due to its open 24-hour a day policy. 

According to the store manager of the Breezeway, Leticia Palma, the store was able to expand its hours because of student requests. It is located between the towers in the residential quad.  

Palma agrees that the hours are beneficial to students.  

"They have access to anything at any time," Palma said.  

Located in the left tower of the residential halls, the Breezeway Cafe is  convenient for those who live on campus. The store resembles a 7-11 and provides toiletries, snacks and meals, such as sandwiches and pizza. The new policy began at the start of the Fall semester, and students on campus are already taking advantage.  

"When my roommates and I are up late studying and nothing else is open, we can go right downstairs and get a pizza," said freshman Angelica Agostini, who is majoring in music performance.  

Junior Jamie Gonzales, visits the store approximately three times a week. Like Agostini, Jamie finds the schedule convenient for her late night cravings and necessities as well.  

"It's so much easier than driving to Walgreens," Gonzales said.  

Students  not living on campus can also visit the store if they are on campus late at night studying or visiting. 

Although students like the new hours, there is a catch. The Aramark Corporation has had to justify the extra hours. Extra income must be given to those Breezeway Cafe employees working during peak hours of the evening.  

The regular hourly pay of an employee is $6.15, but the after hour pay shoots up to $8.50 an hour.  

According to Palma, no more than 20 students visit the store in the late hours of the night, students mostly come into the store in the morning or during lunch hours. 

Because of these implications, the store manager states that the Breezeway Cafe could limit the 24-hour a day schedule to weekends only. 

That would mean no more midnight snacks for students and more trips to Walgreens and other stores for necessities - unless students start taking advantage of the hours soon.

"My roommates and I visit the store at least twice a week around 12 a.m.," Agostini said. "Sometimes the Graham Center doesn't accept credit cards, so the Breezeway is more convenient." 

Although the store is accessible, like most things on campus, prices are a little more expensive than usual. However, this does not stop students from heading to the Breezeway Cafe.  

"It's a little expensive, but it's reasonable," Gonzales said. 

A major perk the extended hours offer is if a student were to wake up at three in the morning and have a sudden longing for cookies, they can head down to the store and satisfy their hunger.

Headline: Guaranteed contract decreases reception registry
Author: Karen Buitrago / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For approximately four years, Iglesia Mision Carismatica Internacional has rented the ballroom at the Biscayne Bay Campus every other Saturday and Sunday, leaving students with fewer opportunities to rent the ballroom for weddings and other social events.

According to Greg Olson, director of the Wolfe University Center, the church pays in excess of $100,000 a year, and has a contract with the university until 2006. 

"This is the largest contract in our history," said Jennifer Cooper, associate director of operations and events for WUC.

She said the contract with the church benefits students because it creates revenue to improve student services. 

"[We] are happy with this group,"  said Cooper.

Olson added that rarely are weddings held on Fridays, the day the church doesn't use the ballroom on campus. This year, at least two weddings have been held in the ballroom overlooking the bay in WUC 244.

Olson said the university has been renting the ballroom since the inception of the building around 1978. Now, it seems students don't want to take advantage of the ballroom.

"It doesn't make sense to go ahead to [the] outside when we have a guaranteed contract ... students weren't using the facilities," Olson said.

Some students said they didn't even know the ballroom could be rented for weddings and other events.

"I didn't know. [This] is a good opportunity for people to know," said Jenny Padura, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism.

She added that students wouldn't directly benefit if more weddings were held on campus. 

"[The University] keeps raising our tuition," she said.

Leyssy Millan, another senior majoring in journalism, also admits she didn't know about renting the ballroom for weddings. 

"[We] should have more weddings on the bay. I think if it's a reasonable price and good service, it would be perfect," Millan said.

 Other students, such as Amy Vidal, disagree.

"If the ballroom is being rented out on a weekly basis, then it's financially better for the school because weddings are done occasionally, not every week," Vidal, a sophomore majoring in political science said. "I think if the school had enough money to provide another area just for weddings, that would be great. But if not, I don't see anything wrong with the ballroom being shared."

According to Vivian Perez, assistant director of marketing and guest relations for the WUC, the space is advertised online. 

"[We] do a lot of targeted marketing and are working with a very small marketing budget," Perez said.

But the small marketing budget and lack of awareness has hurt registry.

"I think we should have more advertisement on campus for the use of the ballrooms. Anything that brings money to the school will benefit the students in the long run. We have beautiful ballrooms on campus and they should be put to use," Vidal said.

The funds created from weddings and other events are used to run operations in WUC.

WUC currently employs 60 part-time students and on weekends, students run the operations at the center, allowing them to gain experience.

"[We] do various projects, buy new equipment, hire additional staff, assist in marketing and do events," Cooper said.

Headline: Students, parents impressed at open house
Author: Stella Junco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although FIU posts information on university resources and benefits on its website, the university decided to gather all the departments and programs offered at a four-hour open house session for applicants and their parents, for the first time. 

"While the Internet offers facts, people can provide both on-sight information and explanation," said Sharon Eaddy, director of the enrollment center, while explaining her concerns as head coordinator of the first ever Biscayne Bay Campus open house.

The event took place Oct. 8 at BBC's Panther Square and Mary Anne Wolfe auditorium. 

Invitations were received via mail and Internet registration in the hopes of increasing student enrollment.

Administrators, professors and student peers were well-equipped to provide information about FIU, highlighting significances such as the school's mention in US News and World Report's list of 100 Best Public Schools.

 Also, the school was mentioned as one of the top five programs in Hospitality Management in the US and top 10 in the world, according to vice provost Raul Moncarz.  

"Not just students, but parents are getting direct interaction and system information otherwise only obtainable through a mixture of impersonal research and possible visitation of the university's different divisions," said Franklin Soares, vice-president of the Bay Vista Hall Council.

Student involvement on campus has notably increased the graduation rate, a statistic not neglected by Brian Haynes, assistant vice president of Student Affairs, at the open house's inaugural presentation. 

"[Our] university is not an airport. Students come not only to study, but to enjoy," Moncarz said.

FIU's promise of vast resources, including programs such as Career Services and admissions, personal attention and affordability proved effective to concerned parents.

 "[The] faculty gave me real people [to whom to] ask specific questions. I am a foreigner and did not attend school here in the U.S., but the event allowed for details," said Ricardo Bravo, a parent. "I wanted a whole understanding of the university for my daughter, with no empty spaces."

The event provided students and graduates with a helpful scoop on the range of services and programs the university offers. 

Information on everything from housing to learning services was available at booths which were equipped with pamphlets and student guides.

"I was just looking for information online when the open house popped up and I registered. [I] was not expecting all this attention and interest made ready for me on demand," said Maresha Theogene, a student from North Miami Senior High.

The Admissions office also held one-on-one interviews with a number of students who had already filled out applications.

Two prospective students attending also received $250  scholarships on behalf of Moncarz and Haynes, intended for use on future classes at FIU.

Student enrollment is on the rise, and this open house proved there is no doubt the trend will continue.  

"Students like to identify with excellence, certainly," said Dwight Nimblett, coordinator of Learning Services.

Headline: Students partake in AIDS, poverty awareness
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Many have seen the black and white commercials on television featuring a parade of celebrities, such as Brad Pitt and Paul "Bono" Hewson, urging regulars to help in the fight against global AIDS and extreme poverty. 

On Oct. 12, students of different ethnic backgrounds, races and nationalities united at the Graham Center Ballrooms in support of "Fighting for What's Right", a program sponsored by the ONE Campaign, a high profile, celebrity-driven push to rally Americans to fight against the epidemics of AIDS and extreme poverty. 

"It was a very well executed program. It made us realize that by contributing and raising awareness, we can, in our own small ways, achieve great causes," said junior Chad Ferreira.  

The purpose of the program - organized by a group of students - was to inform others about the campaign by inviting speakers such as Derreck Kayongo from Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE), Anthony Okonmah from The Foundation for Democracy in Africa and  Dawn Addy director of the FIU Labor Center. They informed the 200 plus students in attendance about their respective organizations and what they can do to help.

"I was very impressed by the student turnout. Usually, the turnout for these type of events is low, but word of mouth was very good and it's a testament to the hard work put in by the organizers of the event," said junior Sean Loret De Mota.

ONE, founded by 11 of America's most well-known and respected non-profit humanitarian organizations including Debt AIDS Trade Africa (DATA),  CARE, Oxfam America and World Vision, has built its goals based on commitments made at the G-8 Summit to increase aid and debt relief, especially in Africa. 

Among  goals addressed at the summit were eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child mortality rates, combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases and ensuring environmental sustainability.

"The idea behind ONE is to make poverty history," Kayongo said.  "However, it isn't easy and it's a long process, but every step taken is a step gained. The aim of the program is to get people to join the movement and to petition the world's governments to prioritize these issues. Kayongo involved the audience, with quips while offering informative facts about ONE. Kayongo spoke about his family fleeing Uganda for Kenya in 1980 to escape the rule of authoritarian ruler Idi Amin Dada. It's his experiences in Uganda, a country that has seen more than 20 years of civil war at the cost of more than 2 million people that compelled him to join CARE and speak out on behalf of those who couldn't. At the end of his speech, he led the audience to break into a Swahili song in celebration for what was achieved.

The Swahili song wasn't the only musical segment of the evening. Giovanny Castao presented the audience with a sensational rap performance on the problems caused by guns and poverty; the FIU Gospel Choir performed a soulful rendition of the national anthem and members of the Black Student Union treated the audience to an African dance.

Kwesi Tarradath, a senior majoring in public relations, is one of the many students actively involved in organizing the event. He stressed that it is important for students to take interest.

"Seeking information is an important step, but by joining something productive with new found knowledge is an even greater step," Tarradath said.

Also addressing students was Okonmah, executive director of The Foundation for Democracy in Africa, a non profit, non-partisan organization established in 1994 to help emerging African democracies into the global economy.  

"The aim was to implement a culturally biased program to discuss the fundamental principal of democracy - equality," Okonmah said. 

During the Cold War, Africa was the battleground of the East and the West. After the Imperial nations gave African nations independence, they prematurely left them in the hands of inexperienced rulers, who squandered resources. Africa has been recovering from one of the worst periods in its history, where most of its nations were engulfed in civil wars started by authoritarian rulers who looted and depleted, resources in the countries.  

"This was the dark period of Africa," Okonmah said, referring to this era in African history. "However, times are changing and Africa is developing. Twenty-seven of the 47 nations in the continent are considered free or partly free, with leaders selected through multi-party elections. Students and young leaders are beginning to ask the right questions regarding corrupt officials. 

Despite extreme technological advancements in agriculture, a vast majority of Africans die due to famine and mal-nourishment. About 30,000 children die a day from preventable causes and about half of the 400 million people in Africa live on less than $1 a day. 

The life expectancy in some countries has dropped to as low as 47, mainly because of the AIDS epidemic. 

"If one percent is all it takes to reverse these conditions, then it brings great hope to know that one person can make the difference," said freshman Maria Evans.

The campaign has urged the U.S. Government to increase its spending on foreign aid by an additional one percent: The budget allocated for meeting basic needs of developing countries, namely, health care, education, clean water and food.

"Currently, the U.S. government spends just 0.8 percent of their budget on federal spending. We're not asking for people's money, but to know about the organization and to sign the petition," junior Virginia Chan said, another student involved in the program.

Indeed, the campaign does not ask for contributions via vast donations. Rather, it receives contributions by selling $1 wrist-bands and t-shirts via its website www.one.org. The white wrist-bands, in particular, have become a popular symbol. The campaign encourages visitors of the website to sign a petition, requesting governments to increase spending on education, health and food aid, among other issues. Currently, there are more than 2 million petitions.

Headline: Thrice shows different side
Author: Zachary Duarte / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Thrice, who were once known as the "saviors of screamo" have taken a step back. Out with guitar slashing and ear-splitting screams, in with piano melodies and whispering vocals. 

While not all the screaming is gone, it seems to be the only part of the old Thrice left. 

Their new album Vheissu, which is German for "Who are you?" is a new look for a band that had vanished into a music scene overloaded with talent. 

The opening track, "Red Sky," begins with a distant drum beat and a soft piano interlude. Once lead singer Dustin Kensrue's gentle voice enters, thoughts of Thrice abandoning their old sound began to creep into the mind. 

A minute into the song and still no loud roars of Kensrue's voice, only the harmonizing of his singing. 

I waited it out and listened to the other tracks. 

I was amazed by how much piano was used. It's almost as if the piano melodies were meant to replace the powerful screams heard on Thrice's three previous albums.

Could this be the follow up to such a successful album as The Artist in the Ambulance, which was full of rage and angst against the world? In Thrice's single, "Stare at the Sun," off their last album, Kensrue's lyrics depict a man questioning his own religion. 

Now with a Hebrew script tattoo on his left forearm and living the married life (along with newly married guitarist Teppei Teranishi) Kensrue and Thrice seem to have musically matured.

Not only has Thrice added harmonizing vocals and piano sounds to their tracks, but also some neat studio effects have been mixed in to make a sometimes shaky or hollow feeling. 

In "Music Box," an eerie tune from an actual music box is used to start the song. 

A feeling of old Thrice could be sensed when the chorus of the song kicks in. 

But intertwining the tune of the music box and the guitars was just pure brilliance on the part of producer Steve Osborne. 

On tracks such as "Atlantic," Kensrue's voice never reaches past a whisper. 

Besides drums and bass, Thrice uses an acoustic guitar to further soften the vibe, and an occasional melody from the electric guitar. 

The song flows together like no previous Thrice song has, and may even appeal to the parents of current fans.

Without a shadow of a doubt, Vheissu  sends Thrice fans the message of "We are out with the old and in with the new." 

With this album, it's up to the listener to be open-minded and not expect the old Thrice when listening to it. 

The only question left for listeners and fans is, "What's next?"

Headline: Inspecting Carol
Subheadline: Theatre department brings comedy back to the stage with new play
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The much-anticipated Christmas comedy "Inspecting Carol" made it's debut in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center Thursday, Oct. 13. 

Audience members were greeted at the door with hors d'oeuvres, festive decorations and even the occasional holiday carols to set the tone for the evening. 

Once inside, their peals of laughter showed they enjoyed the performance even more than the refreshments.

"Inspecting Carol" was written by Daniel Sullivan in 1992, along with the Seattle Repertory Theatre. 

The play was influenced by Nikolai Gogol's 1836 work, "The Inspector General," but especially by Sullivan's own experiences as an actor. 

The story line revolves around a small, amateur theatre company that has survived for 13 years - every year putting on the same production of "A Christmas Carol" - until now, when the National Endowment of the Arts threatens to pull their $30,000 grant. 

To regain the funding, they must show an increase in "creative productivity." 

When the ambitious wannabe actor, Wayne (Danny Saltos), shows up looking for a position, the company mistakes him for an undercover NEA inspector and eagerly hires him in hopes of making a good impression. 

When the true inspector (Corinne Farkash) shows up, however, it is at the least expected and worst possible moment, and the ensuing mishaps she witnesses are disastrous.

"Inspecting Carol" was chosen because lately the theatre has put on a variety of shows except for comedy, and that it's good to move back into farce to be more well-rounded," said Lisa Lagrande, the play's house manager.

Amidst the play's unique array of characters, some stand out because of their particularly humorous personalities. 

Larry (David Solomon) is an innovative actor frustrated with routine, and eager to bring bizarre and politically-charged changes to the script in the name of art. 

Dorothy (Deanne Saavedra) is the older British voice coach who, when urged to speak with an American accent, breaks out into a full Southern drawl. 

The expertly-played Mary Jane (Caro Zeller) is always ready with sarcastic comebacks.

The character of Wayne (Danny Saltos) is just crazy, claiming he is searching for his inner bliss, and putting on an exaggerated rendition of Shakespeare's "Richard III." 

Although not major themes in the play, some of "Inspecting Carol's" strongest moments are when it addresses racial and political issues through humor. 

When Walter (Lewis Dawkins), the one African-American actor is told about his role, that "ghosts are just white," he replies, "Oh great, so after I die, I can buy on credit." 

These are lines that make the audience laugh, but later on might also make them think.

Unfortunately, the play's ending is rather predictable (perhaps Larry's "no resolution" ending might have been preferable), with one of the characters offering the cliche moral to look deeper beyond appearances. 

Despite this, and a few other weaknesses in the script, the cast still performed excellently and the production received many cheers and a standing ovation as the curtain went down.

"Inspecting Carol" will continue playing until Oct. 23, Thursdays through Sundays at 8 p.m., as well as Sundays at 2 p.m.
