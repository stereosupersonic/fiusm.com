Headline: Santeria, hip-hop courses work toward deconstructing religious, racial stereotypes
Author: Nicole Acosta / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Africana arts classes within the African New World Studies (ANWS) program emphasize that African influence can be found almost everywhere. 

They also deconstruct stereotypes in African-influenced genres according to Akin Ogundiran, ANWS director.

This Fall, ANWS is offering courses that deal with everything from hip- hop music and the Santeria religion to Africana arts and its history.

The Race, Gender and Sexuality in Hip-Hop course "examines racial, gender and sexual identity constructions within the context of hip-hop culture in the United States,"  according to Dionne Stephens, associate chairperson for the Department of Psychology.

Stephens said it is important for all students to take her course because hip-hop  is not exclusively consumed by people of African descent. It has become a part of other cultural expressions, such as reggaeton, an urban, Latin- American genre.

Although many people have formed stereotypes about the hip-hop genre, few discussions concerning these stereotypes are researched or historically-oriented, which is a problem, Stephens said.

"People often assume hip-hop is a one-dimensional culture that is misogynistic and degrading to women. It is true that these elements have become part of the culture, but it would be wrong to assume that these attitudes represent the entire culture," Stephens said. "Further, it is important to understand the history and reasons why sexism, homophobia and racial stereotypes are viewed as pervasive in hip-hop."

The Introduction to Africana Arts course will "introduce students to the visual arts in Africana cultures from Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and African America," according to Ogundiran. 

Taught by Gene Tinnie, African and African Diaspora Art professor, the course will lead into the study of how enslaved Africans brought their art to the Americas.

"It's a combination of different things and the idea of that people's art is the instrument of their freedom," Ogundiran said. "To understand the contributions of Africana people to the world and civilization, you have to [understand their] artistic creativity because it is in the artistic creativity that we truly understand the individual and what they are thinking and their visions of the world."

Ernesto Pichardo hopes the students in his Santeria and Transnational Perspectives course will realize there are other, non-Judeo-Christian religions and also learn how each of these religions contribute to the local society.

Santeria, a religion practiced in the Caribbean and South Florida, integrates the worship of Yoruba deities, which stems from West Africa, with the worship of Roman Catholic saints.

Pichardo, a Santeria priest and ANWS honorary research fellow, will introduce five to six guest speakers throughout the course. 

They will each address a different aspect within Afro-Cuban Santeria and its history in the Caribbean and South Florida.

"[Santeria] has religious and cultural significance, but also social and political significance. It gives students the opportunity to understand and scrutinize a religious reality that is part of the South Florida community that has been exposed through the media using stereotypes and stigmas," Pichardo said.

Ogundiran said taking these courses are not only essential for students who want to learn more about their African identity and background.

 "You look at Latin American music and African heritage is written all over it," Ogundiran said. "So the classes are not necessarily meant [for] only peoples of African descent [that] claim that identity, it is actually a contribution to multiculturalism on our campuses."

Race, Gender and Sexuality in Hip Hop, ADS4920, meets Tuesdays from 6:25 to 9:05 p.m. in the Graham Center, room 279 at University Park. 

Introduction to Africana Arts, AFA4931 and ARH3930, meets Wednesdays from 5 to 7:40 p.m. in Academic I at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

Santeria and Transnational Perspectives, AFA4933, meets Tuesdays from 5 to 7:40 p.m. in Trailer 100 at BBC.

Headline: HUNGER PAINS
Author: Shannon Fallon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A big step in hurricane preparation is making sure your kitchen is stocked. You could experience power outages after the hurricane that last for days, sometimes weeks, leaving kitchen appliances useless.

But the lack of electricity hasn't kept college students from coming up with ideas for edible hurricane food.

Alexandra Gomez, a hospitality major, said her favorite storm dishes are tuna salads and fruit cocktails.

"They're both so delicious, and so easy to make," she said. 

Gomez said all you need for the tuna salad is the following:



1 can of white tuna, drained and flaked 

6 tablespoons of Italian dressing 

¼ teaspoon of curry powder 

1 tablespoon of dried parsley 

1 pinch of garlic powder 

1 teaspoon of olive oil 

1/8 of salt 

1/8 of pepper

 

In a medium bowl, mix together tuna, dressing. Season the tuna with curry powder, parsley, and garlic powder. Mix all together and serve. 

 "The best part is that you can eat it as a sandwich, with crackers, or on top of a salad," Gomez said.

A variation is adding some potato chips in a tuna salad to make it a little taster and crunchier.  

You can also substitute the tuna for canned chicken and even canned seafood. As for the fruit cocktail, check your local grocery store for a variety of individual canned fruits and fruit cocktails.

Another simple idea is diced hot dogs, a favorite item of hospitality major George Ferreira. 

"I mix ketchup and mayo to make a special dipping sauce and dip hot dogs in it," Ferreira said. 

He also suggests Parmalat milk, boxed long-life milk that can be kept on shelves without spoiling.

"My mom buys the juice box sized ones and we use them for cereal in the mornings," Ferreira said. 

For coffee lovers, make sure to stock up on powdered milk and instant coffee. Snackers can turn to crackers and chips, dry foods that become more flavorful with a variety of spreads and jams --  saltines and peanut butter is a common combination.

Tortilla chips and salsa are also a classic snack to munch on -- salsa and nacho cheese can be canned, so spoilage isn't so immediate. 

Remember to stay hydrated, especially with the hot and humid season.

 It is suggested by the American Red Cross Association that a minimum of one gallon of water should be reserved per day for drinking, cooking and re-hydrating dry foods. 

The American Red Cross Association also suggests stocking enough food and supplies for you and your family for at least a week - two is even better.

Don't forget to buy paper plates, napkins and plastic silverware to conserve your water instead of washing the dishes.

 Just make sure to have a manual can opener or you'll be left pretty hungry!

Headline: TOUGH LEARNING CURVE: Team suffers worst loss in history
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Enveloped by both history and the audible roar of 107,638 passionate fans, the Golden Panthers entered Beaver Stadium with the optimism and hope that comes with a fresh season and a new coach. 

The game, however, was a strike of reality and a reminder that last year simply isn't that far in the past.

"We played young. We played young, we played nervous," head coach Mario Cristobal said.

Cristobal's coaching debut was buried beneath a myriad of fumbles and missed opportunities that overshadowed any positives that could have been drawn from the 59-0 loss to the Penn State Nittany Lions. 

For a team as physically outmatched as the Panthers were, it was essential that they play nearly mistake free, but the performance turned in was anything but that.

"We made some typical young team errors," Cristobal said.

Miscues haunted the team from the opening quarter as the Golden Panthers coughed up the ball three times in the first quarter alone, which quickly put them into a 14-0 hole.

Coupled with an inept running game that netted a negative total from the combined backs, the Golden Panthers took a 24-point deficit into the locker room and by the end of the third quarter they trailed by more than 40 points.

The Golden Panthers found themselves overmatched in every facet of the game, both physically and fundamentally. 

The secondary, considered the strongest unit on the Golden Panthers team, routinely left receivers open and surrendered 231 passing yards in the first half alone. Penn State quarterback Anthony Morelli threw for a career-high three touchdowns and 295 yards. 

The front seven on defense managed to strangle the Lions rushing attack for the first half, but collapsed in the second, giving up a total of 210 rushing yards and 26 first downs. 

Starting quarterback Wayne Younger, who despite losing the ball on a sack in the first half, demonstrated a degree of poise on several of the many times the pocket collapsed around him. Wayne went 12-25 for 117 yards before being replaced by Colt Anderson early in the third. 

"We are going to keep the quarterbacks competition alive," Cristobal said.

The Penn State defense absolutely overwhelmed every attempt thrown at them. The offensive line looked broken and lost, leading to third quarter penalty where the referee delivered the call, "prior to the snap, false start, on the entire offensive line."

"You better prepare yourself on the mental part, and we weren't," Cristobal said. 

Receivers failed to get open, as Greg Ellison led all receivers with three receptions for 31 yards. 

The team set a record punting the ball 12 times and fumbed the ball five times. In addition, defensive back Lionell Singleton fumbled the ball on three seperate occasions while on special teams. 

However, the team did not throw an interception all day.

Upon the score reaching 52-0, a scan of the stands revealed a bored crowd that began leaving the stadium before the end of the third quarter. The only response in the second half was elicited from the announcements of the Michigan score, and by the end of the fourth quarter an anticipation of next week's match against Notre Dame was in the air. 

The Golden Panthers committed several mistakes the whole game. 

It will be next week's game against Maryland, played at the Orange Bowl that will give a better barometer of how the team does this season.

Headline: FIU reveals donor
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
The $5 million anonymous donor that has been speculated  since its generous offer to FIU in July 2007 was finally revealed Aug. 29. 

It is the North Dade Medical Foundation, the same organization which has granted more than $50 million to the assistance of many local educational and non-profit organizations since its founding in January 1997, the donor which will lend a hand to the development of FIU's College of Medicine

"We are delighted to announce this generous gift because it addresses our top priorities in the College of Medicine: to recruit the very best faculty and attract talented students," said President Modesto A. Maidique in a press release Aug. 29

The $5 million, which is the largest gift ever donated by the NDMF, will provide funds to merit-based scholarships for medical students from the Miami-Dade and Broward County areas. 

Director of media relations, Maydel Santana-Bravo, said that the reason the funds will not be used toward construction costs of the College of Medicine is because NDMF was adamant that the funds be allocated to benefit the students. 

Dean of the College of Medicine John Rock commented that the exact amount of the disbursement of the scholarship fund per student has not been determined. 

"Hopefully the funds will offset tuition for five to 10 percent of the [first] class," Rock said. 

The first class is scheduled to start as early as Fall 2009.  

 In addition to the funds from NDMF, the State of Florida has agreed to match the donation, funds which will be used to establish chairs in the College of Medicine. 

Rock commented that the College of Medicine is still in the process of recruiting and no candidates for chair positions have been determined. 

"Great students will naturally follow great faculty," Rock said. "This gift will help us recruit excellent local students and will allow us to attract excellent faculty to our college."

Headline: Pines Center offers students other options
Author: Sandra Mateu / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Christine Anderson works 15 to 20 hours a week as a substitute teacher and bookkeeper in an after-school care program in Pembroke Pines. When she gets out of work at 6 p.m., she drives to the Broward Pines Center, 15 minutes away, where she goes to school full time.

Anderson, 22, has taken classes for her psychology major and education minor at both University Park and the Biscayne Bay Campuses, but she prefers to take classes at the center because it's a short commute from where she works.

"[The Broward Pines Center]  is great, there is never a problem with parking, the teachers are great and the center is calm. It works for me, I just go to class and leave," Anderson said. "If they would have more classes I would take them all there."

The focus of the Broward Pines Center is to help the non-traditional commuter students  obtain a one-of-a-kind, higher education experience, according to Isabel Morales, associate director of the Pines Center.

More than 2,000 students are currently enrolled in the Pines Center. Most of these students range from 20 to 60 years old, usually have family responsibilities, a job and are racially diverse, according to Claudia Martinez, coordinator of student affairs at the Broward Pines Center. 

These students attend classes in a state-of-the-art 80,000 square foot facility, which includes case study rooms, a student lounge and a 450-seat auditorium. 

The building is shared by Broward County's Southwest Regional Library and Broward Community College. 

It is also shared by city of Pembroke Pines' Charter High School.

Because most students are non-traditional, the classes are offered late in the afternoon or early in the morning and on the weekend. 

The Broward Pines Center's offices stay open later than at the other FIU campuses and are even open on Saturdays. This helps them with their busy schedules as commuter students said Morales.

"The classes do not interfere since Broward Community College offers different programs, and Charter School students attend in the morning, while FIU students come at night or really early in the morning when there are not other students in the center," Morales said. 

Student life at the Broward Pines Center is different from other FIU campuses due to the students and the campus itself being non-traditional. 

"We understand the needs of our students and facilitate the solving of problems so we can meet their needs. It is a tailoring process," said Diana Little, the director of the Broward Pines Center.

Some of the activities scheduled for this Fall in the student life calendar include Career Week, which will take place from Oct. 8 to 13.

"We have included career development and we want to add help on career resumes and interviews. The point is for them to enjoy, learn and have a positive attitude," Martinez said. "We try to incorporate the stuff the commuter student needs."

Another event taking place at the Pines Center this Fall is Stress Release Week, which will take place from Nov. 26 to Dec. 1. 

According to Martinez, last year's event was a hit at the Broward Pines Center.

"Students come here for a little period of time. They just come to class and then they leave. We try to make that time the best and improve their day. In Stress Release Week they benefited from quick massages and some food, they really enjoyed it," Martinez said.

According to Morales, enrollment has doubled in the last five years and increases steadily every year. 

She also said the students are very pleased with the services and the classes at the Pines Center.

Christine Herrera of Aventura, goes to school and works full-time. She said she likes the atmosphere of the Broward Pines Center.

"It is calm and the classes are more productive because they are right to the point," said Herrera, a junior.

The Broward Pines Center, which opened January 2003, currently offers upper division undergraduate level programs within colleges such as arts and sciences and business administration. 

It also offers master's level programs from the Colleges of Education and Health and Urban Affairs. Doctoral programs from the College of Education also are offered.

According to Little, the center is planning on adding two or three more majors such as elementary education and psychology and a master's in public administration.

 "Everything we do is according to the needs of the students so depending on that, we will add the majors with more demand," Little said.

The Broward Pines Center is at 17195 Sheridan St., west of I-75 in Pembroke Pines.

Headline: Book thefts on campus
Author: Christina Viega / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Frantz Augustin knows a book thief when he sees one. 

Sometimes, it's just a hunch. Other times, the potential thief may get noticeably nervous.

"When the customer doesn't have a receipt and wants a refund-that's usually a red flag," said Augustin, the textbook floor leader at the University Park bookstore.  

Though it doesn't happen everyday, textbook theft at FIU is a more common crime than bookstore employees-and FIU students-would like. 

According to Augustin, thieves manage to take off with textbooks stolen from the UP bookstore a couple of times a week.

Another less suspected crime? Bandits also swipe already bought books from  FIU students and try to sell them back to make a quick profit, Agustin said.

The thefts affect all students, not just those who lose their books, because the bookstore has to raise prices to make up for the loss of profit. 

"[The thieves] shouldn't be so selfish and think about everyone else-but it's probably that they don't care anyways," said senior Jessica Zarate, a psychology major. 

FIU recently apprehended a band of three suspects for shoplifting at the UP bookstore. The police caught the group after they were chased out of the bookstore said Jose Lopez, shipping and receiving supervisor at the UP bookstore.

Sometimes, the thieves work alone as serial shoplifters who come back to the bookstore several times a day, trying to return different books to different employees. 

Other times, the shoplifters try to return books that seemingly don't go together, like undergraduate and undergraduate textbooks.   

"Really, all we can do is make a judgment call," Augustin said.

When bookstore employees are dealing with a suspected thief, there are two options: refuse service or call the police. Sometimes the bandit will make a run for it and all bookstore employees can do is give a description of the suspect and the way he or she left.

"We're not the police-we let them deal with it," Lopez said.

The UP bookstore is currently working on several ways to foil would be book-stealers. According to Lopez, the store is working toward increasing security and possibly striking a partnership with campus safety, though nothing is certain yet. 

In the meantime, students should take their own steps to keep their textbooks safe. 

Augustin and Lopez suggest treating your textbooks just like you would a purse or wallet-keep it out of plain view in your car, never set it on the bathroom floor, and never leave them in the care of someone you don't know. 

They also suggest writing your name in permanent marker so that if your books are stolen, employees at the book buy-back counters can keep an eye out for the stolen property. 

Augustin and Lopez also warn students not to agree to sell books back for people, or you could be aiding in theft.

Lopez also has a word for those students involved in the business of textbook-theft.

"The students doing this don't understand that they are putting their future at risk-not just jail time-but you can get kicked out of school," Lopez said.

Headline: Professor studies Mexican community-owned forests
Author: Christina Lemus / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Professor David Bray is known by students at FIU because he has taught in the environmental studies department for 10 years. But what students may not know is that many months out of the year, Bray is not teaching in the classrooms of FIU. Instead, he is teaching in the forests of Mexico. 

Last summer, five FIU students and six students from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Interdisciplinary Center for Integrated Regional Development of Oaxaca, Mexico worked with Bray in a forest community in Oaxaca. 

The research aimed to prove that community-managed forests reduce deforestation at rates similar to areas protected by the government. 

Through this research, Bray hopes to reveal to other countries with government forest control the benefits of community ownership. 

"The communities living in Oaxaca are traditional indigenous communities who still have many traditional governance patterns and institutions, but are also undergoing rapid change because of migration to the U.S., which for some Mexicans is temporary migration because they return to live in their home communities " Bray said.

The group of students registered for the Community Conservation and Development in Mexico class.

According to Bray, in most communities of the world, it is the government that owns the forests, but after the Mexican Revolution that occurred from 1912 to 1918, the Mexican government began to distribute forest lands to local communities. 

Today, around 60 percent of the Mexican forests are owned by local communities; the second highest percentage in the world after Papua New Guinea.

The Mexican communities have learned over several decades how to organize themselves into community forest enterprises and are able to generate income by harvesting timber, bottling mountain spring water, harvesting wild mushrooms and by ecotourism and therefore have a sustainable lifestyle.

Bray finds research in the Mexican forests worldly important because of its contributing alternative to deforestation-the cutting down of trees or forests. 

"Deforestation contributes around 30 percent of the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming," Bray said

However, community forest management for timber is an alternative to deforestation for agriculture.

Some of the class' daily activities were carrying out interviews with local community members and working with ecologists to visit and evaluate different vegetation complexes. 

Alex Racelis, a master's student at FIU from 2001-2003, studied with Bray in the community forestry of Mexico and considers him to be a perfect mentor.

"The positive impacts of David's research in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, has made him a local legend. You would be hard press to mention Dr. Bray's name and not illicit a smile and a warm greeting [from community members]. He is one of the few academics who truly cares about the broader impacts of his professional work," Racelis said.

In September 2006, Bray was invited to give a presentation to high level Chinese forestry officials in Beijing, who look to Mexico as a model. 

Later that November, he was invited to speak at the World Bank in Washington D.C. for the same reason and in May of 2007, he and his colleagues gave a speech to Mexico's highest ranking forestry official in Mexico City.

 "I felt very proud to be able to communicate the successes of Mexican community forestry in other parts of the world," Bray said. 

He has received financial assistance from the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Tinker Foundation, the US Agency for International Development.

He has also received help from FIU in order to make these annual trips out of the country possible.

Jack Parker, professor of environmental science and chemistry at FIU is a close friend and colleague to Bray and thinks highly of his study abroad class in Mexico.

"I think that his study abroad class helps students get a different environmental experience and a real chance for a global perspective," Parker said. 

Bray plans to continue his research in Mexico and in other countries to understand how communities in other parts of the world can achieve the same results that Mexican communities have. 

He encourages students to get involved in the program by contacting the environmental sciences department at envstud@fiu.edu.

Headline: Women's Soccer: New coach prepares team for season
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The motto: "Building for success one brick at a time" lingers in the women's soccer locker room. 

The first brick cemented to transform FIU athletics is the team's new head coach, Thomas Chestnutt. 

"There's no question turning around the program is the main goal, but it's a step-by-step process," said Chestnutt. "Pre-season was one step, practice is another."

The second head coach in FIU women's soccer history was hired Feb. 10, 2007 by athletic director Pete Garcia. 

Similar to the new coaches hired by Garcia this year, Chestnutt has been involved in elevating a losing team to unprecedented level of play. 

He was a first assistant coach at Fresno State from 2004-2006. The Bulldogs won their first-ever Western Athletic Conference Tournament Championship in 2005 and continued to win finishing with a 13-5-3 record in 2006.

Chestnutt was a heavy contributor to the recruiting process at Fresno State as a first assistant coach. 

In addition to coaching at Fresno State, Chestnutt helped coach the women's UF team as a graduate student working towards his Ph.D in biomedical engineering from 2001-2004. He received his Ph. D May of this year, and he stresses the importance of education to the girls. 

"I told them that education is the number one reason they're here," Chestnutt said.

Having played at the University of Dayton, for the Tampa Bay Cyclones and for the FSC Lohfelden in the German Fourth division, Chestnutt knows firsthand the difficulty of finding a secure job as a soccer player anywhere in the world. 

His scholastic achievements support the message he conveys to his team and convinces them to follow his command. He imparts his knowledge to his team as a whole, but his team captains senior Kristin Hurst, senior Madeline Gannon and junior Kia Rigsby have learned to translate their leader's philosophy to direct their teammates in the right direction.

"We try to stay strong, positive, reinforce what he teaches us and lead by his example," said Gannon.

The captains do implement their own teachings by expecting more from each other than any of the coaches.

"We demand more from ourselves than anybody else," said Hurst. "It's probably because we're out there together tired, sweating, dying together."

The captains have played and participated in practices at FIU for several years, but note a difference from previous seasons.

"The fitness is more intense," said Hurst. "We've been doing two-a-days sometimes three-a-days."

Gannon confirms that practices have been tougher, but notes the practices are producing better stamina and chemistry on the field.

"Change is always hard," Hurst said.

"It was like being a freshman again, but now it's been working out," said Rigsby

Pre-season is over and regular season has begun. Chestnutt now looks to apply his teaching methods for the entire season by systematically alternating players in order to keep them from becoming too fatigued.

"We have to save legs from getting banged up," he said.

A defensive mindset will govern the team throughout the season, and physical contact is required to shut out teams and keep games close. "Defense is a good offense," he said. "I want to have an attack-minded team." Chestnutt's plans for the 2007 season reflect the motto in the locker room, except he views this season as more than just one brick.

"Right now, we want to be competing at a national level," he said. "It's not a matter of if; it's a matter of when."

Headline: Commentary: Successful athletic programs would improve University
Author: Chris Towers / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the college football season underway, there is a palpable buzz around campuses nationwide, with visions of day-long tailgating parties and national championships dancing in the heads of students everywhere.

Yet, following one of the most disastrous seasons in NCAA history, there's an understandable lack of enthusiasm from FIU students.

Unfortunately, there's a growing sentiment among the student population that maybe it isn't worth continuing to sink money into a program that has, thus far, shown nothing but failure in its brief history.

A fair point to be sure. Looking at it logically, why should a university, who's first goal is to educate it's students, spend millions of dollars on an athletic program that has proven more of a liablity than anything to the university? 

Instead of spending money on a new stadium for the football team, or even on new bats for baseball, or spending any money on athletics, why doesn't the school invest in things that will help students academically, like more computers, or lower tuition?

What these critics do not realize is that, for better or worse, the easiest, most lucrative way for a university to become nationally recognized is to have successful athletic programs.

I'm sure most people would agree that FIU has an undeserved bad reputation, and I think alot of that could be the result of nobody having heard of the Golden Panthers, which is partially a product of  not having a nationally recognized athletic program.

On the opposite side, many people work under the assumption that schools such as Duke, UM, and USC are academic powerhouses, despite not having a clue what these schools excel at academically. 

It's not an irrationlal conclusion to make to say that these school's have such a reputation mostly because of their well known athletic programs.

In a perfectly ideal world, the university would be able to provide every student with a free laptop, free books, and tuition that costs $16 per credit while simultaneously fielding a star filled roster at every sport and turn a profit at the same time.

But in reality, the school has to do what it feels will help the students most in the long run, and if it means attempting to build our athletic program to a more respectable level, then how can we complain?

 And another benefit many might not think about is the impact of alumnus on the school itself. Successful athletic alumnus can provide numerous benefits to a school, from money and donations to much needed publicity.

-If former Panther standout Antwaan Barnes gets into the game for the Baltimore Ravens on September 10 on Monday Night Football, 15 million people will hear the name FIU, and that is the type of advertising money can't buy. 

And, perhaps more importantly, alumnus have a history of financially supporting their university via donations. Our neighbors to the east, UM received a $4 million donation from Alex Rodriguez to renovate their baseball stadium in 2002. 

While FIU doesn't have any athletes near Rodriguez's stature, if our athletics programs can see more success, we may see more donations and publicity from our alumnus. 

And, money aside, there are few things better for a college campus than the buzz that sport's can generate. I know I looked up at our peers up in Gainesville and felt a certain tinge of jealousy and envy at the success they saw during the last few football and basketball seasons. 

Seeing the amount of pride and joy that brought to the student body, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if it occurred here.

Headline: Commentary: Nittany Lions prove to be too much for Golden Panthers
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It was what most people knew and what loyal fans wouldn't admit: FIU never stood a chance against Penn State.

The Golden Panthers were demolished 59-0 picking up right where they left off last season by extending their losing streak to 13 games; the number of FIU turnovers exceeded the total points the team scored.  

It was optimistic to think that the Golden Panthers could play a nationally ranked team in their house without being embarrassed. 

Before the first snap, the Golden Panthers were outmatched in the experience department. Head coach Mario Cristobal's zero wins against Joe Paterno's 363 wins was one of many experience mismatches that contributed to the lop-sided loss.

In addition, quarterback Wayne Younger's first collegiate game was defined by consistent pressure by the Penn State defense and his inability to hold on to the ball. 

The offense was stagnant due to the offensive line's inability to create running lanes or provide Younger with enough time to throw the ball. He was sacked numerous times and the running  backs averaged less than 1-yard per carry.  

The offensive line was not able to contain the Penn Sate defense, and the only time they seemed to be on the same page was when the whole line was caught offsides.

Penn State stopping the run from the beginning eliminated the Golden Panthers' chances of producing points on the board by making the true redshirt-freshman quarterback win the game. He was attacked from all angles throughout the course of the game including several times immediately after throwing a pass. 

Younger's mobility provided brief moments of excitement, but the Nittany Lions linebackers did not let him run far causing two fumbles.

The lack of offense made the defense's job much harder. The Nittany Lions offense did not travel much of the field to reach the end zone due to the Golden Panthers ineffective offense giving great field position via turnovers and lack of yards.

 Despite the misleading 59 points, the defense did not perform as badly as the score indicates. They too were able to stop the run in the beginning, but the pass defense gave up long third down conversions, which resulted in longer drives and more scores.

Perhaps the most disheartening performance on the field was the special teams. Besides defensive back Lionell Singleton's three fumble returns, kicker Dustin Rivest had a field goal blocked inside the 20-yard line. That was the best chance for the offense to avoid a shutout. The blocked field goal, however, was not the kicker's fault. The offensive line allowed too much penetration which led to the blocked field goal.

If FIU expects to break their losing streak this season, they will have to fix their offensive woes. The defense is good enough to keep them in most games, but lack of offense fatigues the defense. The good news is that the 59-point results in only one loss. 

Although it is only the beginning, it was not pretty watching the Golden Panthers mauled by the Nittany Lions.

Headline: Men's Soccer: Team looks to regain past glory with new head coach
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The men's soccer team won NCAA Division II championships in 1982 and 1984, the only two national titles won in FIU's history.

Midfielder Munga Eketebi played on the 1984 squad, and he now holds the two plaques in his office as the men's soccer head coach.

Of all the new coaches hired this year, Eketebi is the only head coach hired who spent the previous year with FIU. His predecessor, Karl Kremser, retired this year after 27 years of coaching. 

Kremser coached Eketebi from 1983-1986 before making him part of the soccer team's coaching staff. Eketebi coached alongside Kremser for nearly 20 years.  

After spending so many years together, he could not register the fact that Kremser will not be working with him during the 2007 season.

 "It was like losing a parent," said Eketebi. "You see someone everyday for so long, then you turn around, and they're gone."

Although Eketebi has been helping coach the FIU team since 1987, he did leave the Golden Panthers sideline in 1996 to be the head coach of the men's soccer team at Nova Southeastern University where he compiled a 12-6-1 record. The following year, an official assistant position was open at FIU, and Kremser brought Eketebi back.

Kremser's retirement has left Eketebi to take full control of the men's team for the first time. 

However, he knows the procedures involved in running practices, and he has established contacts in Miami to help him the recruiting process.

"I know the institutions, the clubs and high schools," he said. 

The two speak everyday, but Eketebi says his demeanor on the field is quieter than Kremser's was during practices.

"I don't yell as much as coach," Eketebi said. "But he was from a different generation, and he was much more melo."

According to Eketebi, it is rare to see one coach stay at one institution for several years. It is more difficult to establish a long-term friendship now, than when Kremser began coaching. 

"Coach became more like family," Eketebi said. "It was always Christmas and Thanksgiving at his house."

As head coach, Eketebi's hopes to have a kinship with his players. FIU alumni keep in touch with him, including some of the former Golden Panthers playing Major League Soccer.

"It's a sign that they care about the legacy they left behind," Eketebi said.

His legacy at FIU continues with the 2007 squad. The players will be expected to control the ball or the majority of the game. It's a technical strategy to limit mistakes and limit the opposing team's offense.

"We will play South American style, a possession game," Eketebi explained. "Lots of ground passes are involved."

The defensive strategy will have to mesh with new offensive threats. Last season, the team did not win a when they scored less than two goals. 

"We will rely on offensive power from Cabas, Stovall and Caporaletti," he said. Their development will dictate how the offense performs as a whole. 

Eketebi is one of five new coaches athletic director Pete Garcia hired to change FIU athletics. He will attempt to fulfill one of the most important things his mentor taught him.

"There's no substitute for winning."

Headline: Having a plan: Knowing when the evacuate
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
A proper evacuation time is sometimes hard to determine, but according to Charles Cyrille, emergency management coordinator at FIU, its better to evacuate than staying put.

"If you feel where you live is unsafe, you should always err on the side of caution," Cyrille said.

Cyrille commented that those living in a mobile home should evacuate if winds reach more than 39 mph.

Those not living in a mobile home should be aware of local news in order to know if a mandatory evacuation order has been given. Always have a way to communicate with family and emergency personell in addition to having plans on what to do in case of an emergency.  

For the most part, evacuations for those not living in a mobile home are issued due to flooding concerns over anything else. So living by a body of water will increase the chances of a need for evacuation. 

If You Decide to Stay Home: 
Determine which is the safest room in the house and take all the emergency items you want to keep handy in that room.

Fill your bath tub with water. Floods might contaminate water sources and you want to keep a clean water reserve. Be sure to clean the tub thoroughly before you fill it up.

If you have friends or relatives outside the evacuation areas, planning to spend the hurricane with them might be more comfortable than going into a shelter or batting down the hatches in your own home.

If you are in an evacuation zone, the safest thing to do is always to evactuate.  

If You Plan to Evacuate:
Make sure to plan before the storm and know which shelter you'll be evacuating to (see page two).

Note that not all shelters are open for every storm, but by calling 3-1-1 you can find out which shelters are open.

Depending on where you live in Miami-Dade County will determine where your designated shelter is. For a complete list of evacuation centers and a list of evacuation zones see http://www.miamidade.gov/oem.

&nbsp;
The hurricane hit, the power's out and the roads are filled with debris. Hopefully you followed all pre-hurricane recommendations, but here are some extra tips for after the storm:

• Get updated on your surroundings. Call local authorities and find out if the neighborhood is safe. Many times, authorities can close down roads because of flooding or damage -- you may need to find alternative routes home. 

If you still have electricity or a generator, stay updated with television or radio news for the latest weather coverage and traffic information. Curfews might also be enforced, so be sure to follow them or else you may end up like FIU student George Alvarina. 

"Last year, I was heading home from a friends house, it had to be like midnight," said Alvarina. "I'm driving down Bird Road when I see cop lights in my back mirror. [The cop] pulled me over for being out past curfew. I didn't think it to be a big deal, but the cop insisted on giving me this long speech about the dangers of being out past curfew."


• Drive carefully. Driving in Miami is dangerous enough without a hurricane, but after a storm, many traffic lights aren't operating. Be sure that cars are also functioning properly and that they have enough gas to get you where you're heading. Gas is scarce during a hurricane, meaning long lines for students such as Nicole Amaro.  

"I hate trying to get gas during a hurricane," said Amaro. "Half the gas stations shut down and when you find one that's open you sit there for hours at a time to pump gas for less than five minutes, it's ridiculous."

• Stay in touch with family and friends. Notify them about where you are and where you're going. 

• Try to come home before dark, so you're able to do everyday tasks before it gets dark. Use flashlights in the dark -- not candles. The last thing needed is a fire in the house, which ended up happening to FIU student Jenny Gonzales. 

"My mom, who is a bit old school, decided that it would be a smart idea to light candles around the house," said Gonzales. "Well, she forgot that we have a really playful cat that thought the flame was some sort of a toy. The cat knocked over the candle, which caught the table cloth on fire and continued to burn the table. The whole night was a disaster."

• Be careful with your food. Food spoilage is a big problem after a hurricane. Discard all food that needs to be kept refrigerated. Don't trust your smell - if in doubt, throw it out. Instead, use dried or canned food.  

• There might be contamination in tap water, so do not drink or prepare any foods with it. Don't let pets drink it either.  

• Be patient. Everything will eventually go back to normal. It can be aggravating and stressful to endure the effects of a hurricane, but remember that you are not the only one. 


• Remember to use common sense when it comes to you and your family's safety.

Headline: Coping with Stress (Info Box)
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
• Talk to someone about your feelings - anger, sorrow, and other emotions - even though it may be difficult.

• Seek help from professional counselors who deal with post-disaster stress.

• Do not hold yourself responsible for the disastrous event or be frustrated because you feel you cannot help directly in the rescue work.

• Take steps to promote your own physical and emotional healing by healthy eating, rest, exercise, relaxation and meditation.
• Maintain a normal family and daily routine, limiting demanding responsibilities on yourself and your family.

• Spend time with family and friends.

• Participate in memorials.

• Use existing support groups of family, friends and religious institutions.

• Ensure you are ready for future events by restocking your disaster supplies kits and updating your family disaster plan. Doing these positive actions will be comforting.

Headline: Book prices out of control
Author: Ana Paola Capaldo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
College students always complain about money. If it's not tuition, it's housing. More likely than not, though, if you're a student, you've probably complained about textbook prices-and with good reason.

It's bad enough having to choose between cheaper-albeit scuffed and bent-used texts and more expensive-though unmarred and shiny-new texts. Some students have decided to forgo buying texts at all, opting to "fly solo" in their classes.

It's gotten so bad, even Congress has stepped in. It commissioned a study on the affordability of textbooks, which the U.S. Department of Education published in September 2006.

Apparently, while the problem familiar for us, exorbitant textbook prices are still news for stuffy government officials. There isn't even a committee to regulate the prices publishers bolt on textbooks, like there are for other industries.

Here's just some of the problems the Department of Education found with the textbook industry:

1. Textbook companies often send professors free promotional materials for review. Professors may be tempted to pick out a class's required reading based on the showy graphics and added 'bonuses' in these new editions, ignoring issues of affordability.

2. Sometime, far off in ancient history, publishing companies printed new editions every 6 years. Today, new editions seem to fly off the press almost yearly and professors love to demand that you have the newest edition.

3. No one has bothered to tell college students what J. Bruce Hildebrand, executive director for higher education of the Association of American Publishers, told the Washington Post in a 2004 article: most textbooks-including your $300, 2007-edition biology book-are available in cheaper versions, even in black-and-white, three-ring-binder formats that could cost as little $30.

4. Then there's a new trend of text "bundles ." Recently, textbooks can't seem to come without accessories, matching study guides and assorted interactive software.

If all this weren't enough to make the average student steam with outrage, some professors make us buy expensive books, then barely touch them throughout the semester. Given this, it's unsurprising that so many opt to not buy them at all.

And then there's the practice of some professors require their students to purchase books they wrote themselves. 

Often, these books have just been published and aren't available used. This raises two obvious questions: First, how a professor can be objective about what he or she teaches if they wrote the course material themselves? Second, and more importantly - how can a professor objectively determine that his or her students are getting the best bang for their buck-or at the very least, the best textbook money can buy-when the professor himself is getting a cut of the textbooks? 

Everybody here wins-publishing companies, professors-except students.

The consequence: For some students, the days of choosing a class based on how interesting it might seem or how great the professor is are over. Today, the first thing you must take into account is how much the class will cost you after you pretty much have to take out a loan to pay for textbooks.

Until universities, faculty and students put our fists down and demand the problem of expensive textbooks be solved, we will be forever plagued with textbook costs that rival that of plastic surgeries.

Headline: THE SOAPBOX...An Op-Ed Column: Greeks enrich student life
Author: Celinda Miranda / Special to The Beacon 
&nbsp;
As an involved student, former peer advisor and member of Greek life at FIU, I welcome our new students' candor. I understand their concerns regarding the Greek community and orientation program.

However, I must address some concerns of my own with the Aug. 27 article, "Sorority vs. Study," which criticized the emphasis placed on Greek life and the lack of emphasis placed on academics during the freshmen orientation program. 

Campus involvement is what makes a strong, successful and well-rounded member of the FIU community. 

There are over 100 organizations to get involved with on campus, and "going Greek"  is one of the most successful venues for our students to do just that.

As value-based organizations, fraternities and sororities promote high standards of scholarship and academic achievement. We embody the values of "academic integrity, honor, progressive and positive change, and philanthropic endeavors" mentioned in the article. 

The first Greek letter organization founded was Phi Beta Kappa. It is now an exclusive honor society for students of the arts and sciences. 

Since then, many of our organizations were founded to provide their members with a safe setting for learning and expression. Our founders secretly discussed topics that were not covered in university curricula. 

Our fraternities and sororities have held themselves to high standards ever since - just like the Honors College at FIU. 

In fact, many Greeks are proud members of the Honors College, and they will be sitting next to you sometime this semester in your classes.

All of student organizations are invited to use the orientation program as a recruitment resource.

The emphasis on Greek life, as the article's author noticed, is not due to any agenda to force it on students new to the University.

We do admit that we actively promote our Greek organizations during orientation. But note also that many Greeks are often involved in many other groups, honor societies and organizations on campus.

To understand our commitment to FIU, consider that the following campus leaders are all Greek: the Student Government Association president and vice-president; the Student Programming Council leader, Homecoming and Dance Marathon overall directors, plus many peer advisors, resident assistants, freshman convocation speakers and Panther Camp facilitators. 

Even members of our faculty and administration are proud members of fraternities and sororities. 

I joined Greek life as a junior. 

I was one of those cynical freshmen students and an "uncharacteristic high school student" before I realized the impact that the Greek system offered to me. It provides leadership, scholarship and networking opportunities to its members and it looks great on a resume. 

Academically, our FIU Greek community outperforms non-affiliated students, according to Office of Campus Life statistics.  

The average Greek student's grade point average is higher than the average FIU student's GPA. Greeks have higher graduation rates than those of non-affiliated students and students who "go Greek" are more likely to return to college the following year. 

More importantly, Greek-affiliated alumni have higher average incomes than non-Greek alumni following graduation. 

The "real world" appreciates campus involvement and rewards it accordingly. 

The Panhellenic Council invites Ana Paola Capaldo to go through the recruitment process and see what Greek life is like firsthand. 

Trust this cynic - it's anything but stereotypical.









Every week, The Beacon invites members of the FIU community to speak to fellow students about issues important to them.
This week's guest is Celinda Miranda, a senior public relations major. She serves as chief justice of the Panhellenic Council and recruits for her sorority.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Greeks run FIU
Author: Ketty-Elena Quindemil / Senior Nursing 
&nbsp;
In terms of running the big positions on campus, the Greek community has stepped up to make changes and become a leader. 

Greek life is not for everyone but at FIU, the Greek community runs the school. 

If we want the representation of this University to diversify, the average student needs to step it up.  

At FIU, campus pride pales compared with fellow Florida schools. If the masses snapped out of it and took initiative, FIU wouldn't be so Greek-dominated. 

At some point, I realized that if I wanted resources to succeed as a leader, joining a sorority was the  way. 

There should be more options, but that's up to the rest of the student body. 

You can either sit back and criticize while fraternity men and sorority women run your school, or you can be proactive and change things yourself. 

I challenge the non-affiliated FIU students who are fed up with the Greek community's grip on leadership positions to prove me wrong and show that you can shape the face of our University as well.

Headline: THE ART OF FALL: Wolfsonian makes autumn brighter with exhibits, political
Author: Elsa Reinoso / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
This Fall, the Wolfsonian Museum, located on 1001 Washington Ave., will use the arts to reshape historical events. The museum will also present lectures and photomontages to enrich student knowledge, regardless of their majors.

For those who love history, international issues and politics the Wolfsonian will have "Doing Violence to Perception: John Heartfield and Political Photomontage" in late September.

 During the lecture, Andres Mario Zervison, an assistant professor of Art at Rutgers University, will examine how Heartfield's photomontage reshaped public perception. 

Heartield was one of German communism's most recognized artists and one of Hitler's greatest enemies. 

Wolfsonian Assistant Director Kate Rawlinson believes that this lecture will be a great learning experience for the audience. 

 "John Heartfield took images that reflected the chaos Germany experienced in the 1920s and 30s and made it appealing to the real world," she said.

 She added that the images used for the photomontage are anti-Nazi and might be of particular interest to political artists. 

On Oct. 4 at 7 p.m., Julie Bargmann, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Virginia, will bring a touch of regenerative environmental design to the Wolfsonian with her lecture "Dumb as Dirt." 

This lecture is an investigation of the creative potential of landscape disturbed by industrial decay.

Lectures aren't the only events the museum will be hosting. For those who are passionate about lyrics and rhythm, the museum is promising a melodic night on Nov. 8 with the "Florida Grand Opera Young Artist Studio Concert." 

With this concert, performers intend to transport audiences back to a 1920 Berlin, before Nazi- censorship. 

Museum visitors on Nov. 16 will have the opportunity to see the film Consumption Junction. Curators Barron Sherer and Kevin Wynn will present the 60 minute video which shows a selection of vintage film clips that take a closer look at American consumer culture - from roots to development - after World War II.

Music, business and design won't be the only things highlighted throughout November. On Nov. 30, the Wolfsonian will mount a fully-automated robotic orchestration presenting the 1924 then-scandalous composition "Ballet Mécanique."

Rawlinson said that the original composition of this show calls for 10 human musicians and that the 1953 arrangements presented will feature four pianos and extensive percussion.

Rawlinson also said that no one should miss this event because these types do not happen in Miami very often. 

"The arts are always going to be beneficial for the students in the real world, even those not necessarily within their majors," Babilonia said. 

The museum will also have a large number of events such as book presentations, tours, workshops and educational programs. 

For more information on admission fees, other events and reservations, contact Julieth Dabdoud, communication manager for the Wolfsonian, by calling (305) 535-2622 or by going online to www.wolfsonian.fiu.edu.

Headline: TO BE OR NOT TO BE: Vegetarian lifestyle developing into student trend
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It seems that being vegetarian or vegan has become a trend among celebrities, and while they are garnering much of the media attention for such diets, vegetarian diets and veganism is also relevant within college communities. 

A 2006 Vegetarian Journal poll reported that 1.4 percent of all adults over the age of 18 qualify as vegan, but this figure seems to increase significantly when only college students are interviewed. 

In 2005, Aramark Food Services found that out of 100,000 college students, nearly 25 percent replied that finding vegan meals on campus mattered to them, although their commitment to a vegan diet was not a requirement for such an answer. 

Often confused as having the same definition, the terms 'vegetarian' and 'vegan' aren't interchangeable. 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services web site explains the straightforward definition of vegan - vegans eat only foods derived from plants. 

There are different types of vegetarians, however.  

Lactovegetarians consume not only plant foods but also dairy products, with the exception of eggs. Ovo-lactovegetarians consume all these things as well as eggs. Ovo-lactopescatarians also add fish to their diets.

With the media coverage that vegetarian and vegan lifestyles are receiving, the question about nutritional value remains as does the question of the various possible motivations of the people choosing them. 

Nicole Crane, junior, was raised vegetarian and at the age of 12 decided to make the switch over to a vegan diet. Since then, it's a decision she has not regretted.

"A vegan diet, when it is done correctly, is an anti-cancer diet, and I believe it can also reverse cancer," Crane said. "Vegetarians who still eat eggs and milk are still consuming animal products, excess cholesterol and all the hormones, bacteria and pus found in milk."

Lori Kupferman, a registered dietician at the Wellness Center, however, warns against the pitfalls of lack of nourishment when adhering to the vegan diet. 

"They're missing so many essential vitamins, minerals and proteins," Kupferman said. "Usually the person is malnourished. A multi-vitamin doesn't cut it. They have minimal heart problems, but usually low energy levels because of being malnourished."

She explains that for vegetarians the risk of missing out on essential nutrients may be smaller. 

"If you choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products, the benefits usually are less calories and lower cholesterol," Kupferman said. "Overall, eating less meat is healthier. If you eat properly, as an ovo-lactopescatarian, you can get what you need without supplements." 

Chairperson of the English department,  Dr. Carmela McIntire, has been an ovo-lactopescatarian for about 10 years, ever since she and her husband decided to make the change for health reasons. To this day, all evidence shows that her body is receiving the nutrients it craves. 

"I'm healthy," McIntire said. "My cholesterol's really low. My iron levels are okay. I feel fine."

Her daughter Sarah, though raised by vegetarian parents, only made the decision to become one herself three years ago.

"My biology class raised chickens from eggs, and they were really cute and I didn't want to eat them anymore," Sarah McIntire said. 

Animal rights is only one reason for committing to forego meat. Kupferman stresses the importance of understanding one's own motives, and of understanding what the body needs before jumping into the decision.

"If people choose to be vegetarian because they want to lose weight, they're not going about it the right way," Kupferman said. "Do they know they have to have the rice and the beans together in order to replace the meat in the hamburger?"

When time in between classes is scarce, it might prove difficult for students on vegetarian and vegan diets to track down appropriate food, but Crane has identified specific places on campus where she can get quick snacks that fit her vegan lifestyle.

"At the Panther Stop, there are all the Odwalla products, which I love," Crane said. "They have nice dried fruit and in the bottom corner of the last aisle is a great hummus and cracker snack pack."

Kupferman also recommends planning ahead and keeping snacks balanced.

 "If you think of yogurt and fruit, you're getting several food groups in," Kupferman said. "Your snacks should almost be like a small meal."

Headline: Prominent visitors use University House for stays
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
What started as a sketch on a napkin by Florida International University President Modesto A. Maidique ended as a 12,700 square-feet University House on the east end of the University Park campus.

Built in 2001 and costing more than $2 million, the house was funded by the FIU Foundation: a private, non-profit corporation whose role is in the development of the University as a major educational, cultural and economic resource. Shaped like the letter 'U', the house has marble tiles and a courtyard in the middle that is about 1,000 square-feet.

Before the University House was built, Maidique lived in Pinecrest, but according to El Nuevo Herald, that property belonged to the FIU Foundation and was sold in order to fund the University house. Private donors also played a part in the funding of the building.

Since the construction of the house, designed by Raul Rodriguez of Rodriguez and Quiroga Architects Charters, Maidique has been living on the second floor where his private chambers are located.  

The first floor of the house, however, is used for guest and annual events such as the Student Alumni Association (SAA) annual meeting held every May,.

SAA member Vignesh Doraiswamy has visited the house and remembers it like "stepping into its own class and satisfying every taste."

"You can tell what kind of place it is, in the sense that it is pretty upscale," Doraiswamy said. "I've only been to the first floor. I can't imagine the rest."

Prominent visitors of UP such as the Dalai Lama have stayed in the house's parlor room. The room has a couch that turns into a queen bed, making the room useful for meetings and the accommodation of an overnight guest.

Most of the house's visitors are friends and donors to the University as well as visiting dignitaries such as presidents of foreign countries and guest speakers.

 The President might host a lunch, a meeting or small event for visitors in one of the many rooms, depending on the occasion. Across the hall from the parlor room is the living room, containing a black Steinway 1964 piano that belongs to Maidique. 

"Sometimes he plays the piano, but when visitors come to the house he requests an FIU professor or student from the School of Music to come and entertain them," said Director of Media Relations Maydel Santana-Bravo.

For large receptions or events, the living room furniture is rearranged or removed and becomes integrated with the courtyard once the appropriate doors are opened. 

One of the first and largest events to have taken place in the house was when Sergio Pino of Century Homebuilders gave a donation to FIU's Global Entrepreneurship Center, now known as the Eugenio Pino and Family Global Entrepreneurship Center.

Located at the end of the living room is Maidique's office and personal library of more than 5,000 books. 

The house is home to artwork from artists such as Cundo Bermúdez, Carlos Alfonso and Hung Luo. In the center of the room stands a dining table that seats up to 16 guests for small meetings or dinners. 

"Caterers love [the kitchen] because they don't need to bring their equipment, so it keeps things running smoothly if they just get to show up and have a place to work," said Santana-Bravo.

One of the house's most school-spirited features is a mosaic of FIU's great seal on the main entrance floor with navy blue letters, golden palm fronds and at the center has a background of navy blue and marble letters.

FIU tour guide employee Michelle Oria remembers the house vividly despite visiting the house two years ago.

"It looks like your classic home that you would want to throw a dinner party. The exotic paintings make it a showcase."

Headline: Review: Persona 3 (Game)
Subheadline: Old thriller RPG revamped
Author: Luis H. Garcia / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Between the classes, projects and clubs, high school can be a big time in a person's life. For a small group of students in Gekkokan High School, though, extra curricular activities also involve fighting demons.  

Continuing Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei line, the long-dormant Persona  returns from the Playstation era to deliver a role-playing experience that will captivate its audience.

As a transfer student, your character is quickly drawn into the mystery known as the "Dark Hour," when between midnight and 1 a.m. shadows feed on the minds of human beings, and only those with the power to wield personas - mental projections of one's psyche - can stand a chance against the shadows.

The game takes an interesting approach with the high school backdrop. 

Days are broken up like a school day where you can opt to spend time in class or studying. 

Once at the dorm, you can choose to sleep, study, visit the local mall to buy weapons and items or when possible, explore the shadow's nest, Tartarus, which only appears during the dark hour.  

One key factor to your time at school, besides exams, is how you build your relationships with classmates. 

Some fight at your side against the shadows and strengthen the power of your personas by allowing new personas to be summoned and use new skills. 

While exploring Tartarus, the dungeon always changes and you can see the monsters and decide whether to avoid them or fight.

Combat is handled in turn-based fashion, and exploiting the monster's weakness leads to extra turns, making selection of skills and personas very important. 

Your party will also suffer fatigue from too much fighting, and it will affect performance in combat and school, so balancing rest and fighting shadows is crucial to moving through the game smoothly. 

While loading times and battle control (you can only choose actions for the main character) might be an issue for some, they don't hinder the game much.

Shigenori Soejima's artwork for the game does a great job of portraying the bright, cheerful high school atmosphere and shifting to the dim, twisted and bizarre hue of the dark hour, and Shoji Megura's score follows suit with catchy upbeat tunes and sinister chords.  

Also, the game's material is not for the weak at heart. Shocking scenes and references to demons and the like permeate the game. Even the act of summoning a persona is scary. 

The voiced dialogue and animated scenes further show off Persona 3's high production values and envelop the player in the experience. 

The game even comes with a hard cover art book and a CD of the game's soundtrack.

Persona 3 serves a unique approach to RPGs with its setting and game play and is executed beautifully.  

Fans of the previous Persona games or RPGs in general will find much to enjoy in Atlus' latest outing and as the dark hour comes, school's out and hell's in.

Headline: Review: The New Pornographers - Challengers  (Music)
Subheadline: Band shifts toward pop-oriented sound
Author: Chris Towers / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"Indie super group" is a term that has been applied to numerous groups - from Wolf Parade to Golden Smog to Swan Lake - and in each instance, you can't help but feel that it is being horribly misused.

It isn't necessarily the talent level of the respective bands that makes the term curious, as much as it is the fact that, for the good majority of the population these groups might as well not exist. 

The New Pornographers have, for the majority of the time together as a group, has been known as an indie super group, mostly because the members of the group - A.C. Newman, Dan Bejar and Neko Case - had been known in the indie music world for their solo careers before joining the group.

However, their albums have always simply had the feeling of a super group. 

That ramshackle, thrown-together sound that seems to accompany the best of super groups, has been a trademark of the band's sound in their first three albums and most notably on their debut, 2000's Mass Romantic.

The fourth album, Challengers, which was released Aug. 21, sees the group moving away from that model to a more pop-oriented sound, and also sounding more like a proper band than simply a group of musicians getting together for a few days - a transition that reflects a change in the band's dynamics as well. 

The production as well as the song writing on the album reflects a more band-oriented sound, with the instruments playing off of each other and the background singers and main singers working together as one.

The best example of this new approach for the band is the song "Myriad Harbor," one of the best folk-pop songs of the year.

 Every instrument builds on the ones before it, creating an expansive power pop-inspired song, built on the strength of the impatient background singers, who seem willing to sing over the main vocal if it doesn't let them get their time in.

What this creates is a brilliant, layered song that takes the listener by surprise with clever little details revealing themselves with each subsequent listen, which is a pretty apt description of the album as a whole. 

It would be easy to write off this album as a throwaway power-pop album, which is what it feels like at first, but with subtle songs like "Us Places," "Your Rights vs. Mine" and "Challengers,"  the album reveals little intricacies you grow to appreciate. 

While it may not match the folk-pop genius of their last album, Challengers proves itself a fine album in its own right. As the group continues to look to shed the "super group" title, you can expect them to continue to carve out a distinct sound.
