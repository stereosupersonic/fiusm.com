Headline: Recruiters complain at BBC career fair
Author: Mark Scopetta / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Over 60 employers and volunteer groups squeezed into Biscayne Bay campus' Wolfe University Center square and its surrounding hallways on Sept. 23, presumably to accept résumés and answer any questions students might have. They were mistaken

Many of the companies  accustomed to  traditional career fairs say they weren't ready for the attitude that students took towards the internship and volunteer career fair.

"I'm really surprised," said Colin Salmon, a representative from Sun Trust Bank. "The attitude isn't what we thought it would be. [The students] really aren't giving us the impression that they want to be professionals."

The complaint seemed to be shared by many of the other businesses that set up tables around the WUC.

"Typically, we do the full time career fair," said Guillermo Suarez, a representative from Walgreens. "Here, a lot of people are just showing up without a résumé."

Florence Tai, a representative from Wachovia, also found herself stressed by the student's lack of preparation.

"Right now, hardly anyone has a résumé. We have received only one," she said. 

Tai's partner, Ben Bolanio, shared the feeling. "On the [University Park campus], students seem more prepared; they dress sharper and there is more traffic."

Craig Cunningham, associate director of Career Services, explains the ill preparation of students to problems with the event's schedule.

"This event was originally planned for the 15th of September. But because of the hurricane, we had to postpone it."

At the entrance, Career Services handed out blue cards to students who decided to participate in the event. If the student filled the majority of the squares on the card with either the initials or a sticker from employers then they received a free pizza lunch.

This was something that bothered Irene Rodriguez-Chomat, a Hotel Sofitel Miami representative. "Some students seemed more interested in getting their card stamped for free food than they were [interested] in the positions that I was offering."

Many of the students who were interviewed had no clue about the event until they walked into the Wolfe Center.

"I just found out about this event today. I had no time to bring a résumé," said Ingrid Morales, a freshman majoring in industrial engineering. 

Another student, Ellen Wise, a junior majoring in hospitality and tourism went through the same chanel of information. 

"Somebody told me about this event when I drove in this morning. I'm not prepared at all," said Wise.

Not all students, however, remained unprepared. Handy Mussotte, a junior who heard about the event the night before, brought plenty of résumés for potential employers .

"This [career fair] was larger than usual. It interested me because typically you don't find internships at career fairs." 

One employer, Claudia Vasquez, an Enterprise representative more accustomed to internship/volunteer career fairs, talked about the students' attitudes.

"For an internship and career fair this was pretty average. People are looking for a job and not a career so they tend to be less professional. I also tend to not bring free pens and key chains to these particular types of career fairs so I can assure myself that people with whom I'm speaking are more interested in employment than free stuff."

Cunningham, when informed of the employer's complaints,  responded with an optimistic tone.

"From the few employer review sheets that I've seen so far, the sentiments among the participants are very positive," he said. "The south campus fair is a career fair. It's a completely different event. Here students are looking for a part time job instead of a career so they tend to be less professional about it."

The students are not the only ones to blame, says Cunningham.

"Also, the area in which we are located is a high traffic one and lends itself to having people show up who didn't originally know about the fair and are ill prepared," he said.

Due to the threat of Hurricane Jeanne, the UP career fair was rescheduled for Oct. 4.

Headline: Men's soccer loses home opener to rival FAU Owls
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The No. 25-ranked FIU men's soccer team dropped its home opener against cross-town rival, Florida Atlantic, at University Park on Sept. 22. The 2-0 loss marks just the third time a visiting goalkeeper records a clean sheet at FIU since Sept. 2, 2001. The loss puts the Golden Panthers at two wins and three losses for the season.

The Golden Panthers lead the all-time series over the Owls, winning 23 of the 27 matches played. This was just the third victory for FAU over FIU since 1980 and the Golden Panthers won five of the previous six consecutive matches. The teams tied 1-1 after double-overtime last year.

The first half of the game ended scoreless with neither side able to capitalize despite several good chances. The Owls out-shot FIU 6-5 through forty-five minutes and 16-11 for the game. FIU sophomore keeper Sean Crowe (five saves) was tested more often then FAU's Anders Granstad as the Owls' seven shots-on-goal bested FIU's three.

FAU's Josh Garbee opened the scoring in the 73rd minute capitalizing on a penalty shot to tally the game winning goal. Less than three minutes later, a goalie miscue at the top of the box allowed Owl's midfielder Rustin Kluge to center a ball to Bjorn Totland, who netted a second goal in the lower right corner, giving FAU the 2-0 advantage in the 76th minute.

Three yellow cards within the first 15 minutes and 17 seconds set the pace for a match that stopped frequently. 

The referee charged 25 fouls between the two sides, including an early yellow card to FIU co-captain Allen Handy. For a defender, a yellow card can mean being overly cautious when tackling, which can result in weak defensive efforts to avoid expulsion. 

"I thought a lot about the booking in the first half," said Handy. "But in the second, I had to just go out and play. We played a lot of long ball and that's not our game."

The ideas were there for FIU. Carron Williams, the speedy FIU forward, found the ball at his foot several times on counter-attacks, but was only able to get one shot on goal with little effect. FIU could not capitalize from set-pieces, despite having more opportunities than FAU. The Golden Panthers' league- best, 2.25 goals-per-game scoring offense was dormant.

&nbsp;
At an away game in Tallahassee, women's soccer suffered a 1-0 to the hands of Florida State University on Sept. 19. This game advances the Seminoles 7-1. Meanwhile, this game puts the Panthers 2-5 for the season.

The Seminoles shot 11 times and FSU's Kelly Rowland scored at minute 42:37 of the first half. During the second half FSU continued the pattern with 12 shots as the Golden Panthers only kick out four shots during the second half. 

In the beginning of the second half midfielder Janessa Taddei shot from top of box. 11 minutes following that, forward Janet Ligouri kicked a shot in an effort to tie the game. 

Goalkeeper Madeline Gannon faced many attacks from the Seminoles and finished the game with five saves, two in the first half and three in the second. 

One of the major stops by Ganno was a slide at the feet of FSU's Jez Patliff. Later, Gannon took a dive toward another save inorder to stop a second goal from being scored.

Next game will be against Florida Atlantic University on Sept. 28 at Boca Raton. The next home game will take place Oct. 1 at 7 p.m. against Middle Tennessee at the Soccer Stadium.

Headline: Coach Kremser to Jared Rose: "Never give up"
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
For 20 games last season Jared Rose had to live under the shadow of star midfielder and Major League Soccer draftee John Pulido.

With Pulido gone, Rose took advantage of the opportunity and listened to Coach Karl Kremser who always told him to never give up.

"The one thing Coach Karl Kremser always taught me was to be persistent.  Never give up.  If things aren't going the way you want, just keep at it."

Jared Rose is the very definition of persistence.  Coming out of one of the most respected soccer programs in high school two years ago, Rose had to start all over after being a high school star at Gaither High School. 

Rose had to resign himself to adapt and play a smaller role until his turn came.

"I was just glad to be part of the program," Rose said.  "I was gaining experience and learning a lot from the three upper classmen.  I really looked up to them."

The dream started miles west from this Everglades environment and in the city of Tucson, Arizona.  That is where five-year-old Jared Rose got his start in athletics.

"My dad [Tom Rose] tried me out and I played every sport: basketball, baseball and football.  But soccer was the most challenging, so I stuck with it."

Rose then moved to Tampa, Florida to take part in one of the great high school soccer programs at Gaither.

"[Playing at Gaither] made me who I am.  It made me realize how to play the game as a team."  	You would think that a player with so much talent and such little exposure would look out for number one when given the opportunity. 

But that's just the kind of person he is:  a humble player who cares more about the name on the front of the jersey then the one on the back. 

Lucas was honored Atlantic Soccer Conference Player of the Week for his play during the Carolina Nike Classic.

During the tournament, Rose scored a pivotal goal for the Golden Panthers in the 75th minute versus then-No. 7 North Carolina to tie the game at 2-2 and force overtime. He later assisted Lucas Scudeler on the game-winning goal in the second overtime. Even with this season's success, Rose was still not sure if his opportunity would come.

"Starting spots were never guaranteed.  Coach [Kremser] always told me they were earned."

By resting up well, staying healthy, and losing 15-20 pounds, Jared Rose put himself on the path for greatness. Coach Kremser has been pleased with Rose's play.

"He's done well. Jared's done well this year for us," said Kremser who has seen Rose grow as a player this season.

Discipline is another trait that has been a part of Rose's character all his life by practicing harder and longer than other players. It's what carried him through those long freshman and sophomore seasons and what influences his unselfish play on the field today.

"One thing everybody sees in me is how disciplined I am.  They actually say I am not as selfish as I should be," Rose said.

In every great athlete there is always that defining moment that sets him on a higher level.  

For Michael Jordan, it was a game winning shot his freshman year in North Carolina. For Ken Griffey Jr. it was being named to the All-Century Team. For Rose, it was winning the Sun-Bowl Tournament in his junior year of high school. 

"Winning the [Sun-Bowl] tournament was critical in my life because we weren't even supposed to be in it.  Suddenly, other players started looking to me and I was the focal point."

Headline: Hurricanes Trouble South Florida
Subheadline: The threats of Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne hurt FIU Golden Panthers and local teams Florida Marlins and Miami Dolphins
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The biggest opponent is one that cannot be defeated, stopped or dodged. For the FIU Golden Panthers, Florida Marlins and Miami Dolphins, the toughest opponent they have faced has of course been the hurricanes and tropical systems.

The ongoing affects of Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne have put a curse on the South Florida world. 

Due to the threat of the storms, one team is out of the playoffs, another is on its way, and one has yet to even play its first home game almost a month into the season.

FIU has suffered as much as anyone with the hurricanes' fiascos. The home opener was cancelled because Frances, failing to give fans a first look at a veteran squad with Division I-A title. 

Now, game two was postponed due to the threat of Jeanne.

Talking to players over lunchtime on Friday, 12 hours after the word of the cancellation, players were angry at the fact of yet another missed game. Players shouted, "I'm pissed!" as they sipped some Powerade and ate the over-dipped barbecue wings being served at the university cafeteria. 

Players prepare both physically and mentally to go against opponents in a game where preparation comes from hours of training. 

The cancellation of games affects players who prepared mentally before going into battle.

It is disheartening for players who spend sleepless nights waiting for the big day. Another stab in the heart of FIU was the expectations of a packed stadium. 

The Athletic Department spend over $100,000 to bring Method Man and Redman. Commercials for the game were taking place throughout local radio stations in efforts to attract the largest crowd in history. 

After two back to back cancelled games, the question is whether this will hurt the football program in the long run? Will fans be as excited to watch the next game without a Method Man and Redman but just plain old football? 

There can also be a positive to it. With two cancelled games, what if more games are cancelled and the team doesn't need to average 15,000 fans with no home games.

Frances was also the Marlins' worst enemy this season . The team was coming off an eight-game win streak before the series against the Cubs that had to be cancelled due to Frances. 

As a result, the Marlins had to play one of those home games at the Cubs house. 

The Marlins ended up having to play more scheduled home games in Chicago against the Montreal Expos which was okay because they won two but upon returning home, the Marlins lost to the same team they beat twice.

The Dolphins weren't immune to the hurricanes either.

The fins moved their season opener up one day earlier and were killed on the field. 

The team had less time to prepare and players began openly complaining about the bad weather that cancelled various practices, since Hurricane Charley.

It has been disappointing for Miami fans. Games have been cancelled and teams like the Marlins and Dolphins have been going through losing droughts.  

It is ridiculous that the first Golden Panther home game will take place Oct. 2, exactly a month after the first game was originally scheduled, - well, that is if Hurricane Matthew or Nicole doesn't decide to drop in and say hello.

Headline: Hip-hop phonies flood mainstream pop culture
Author: Danny Muela / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
So the other day, my girlfriend and I wound up at Blockbuster. We usually end up here after we have grown tired of eachother's company. 

As we started looking over the new releases, one title caught my eye, the infamous "You Got Served" was sitting right there. 

From what I heard, the movie was so bad that the Pope declared it an affront to God and immediately stormed out of the theater without even finishing his Goobers.  

My morbid curiosity started acting up and I asked my girlfriend if she wouldn't mind watching to see how bad it was. She looked at me and said "maybe," which is the one word that all girlfriends say when they start to realize that their boyfriends have finally gone insane. 

We kept on walking and checking out the other new releases. Apparently, everything was sold out except for "The Passion of the Christ" and "You Got Served." I bet that this is the only time that those two movies have been mentioned in the same sentence.

Because I didn't want  to sit through a movie that is fake and just pushing a lifestyle that I want no part of, I chose "You Got Served." 

After watching this "film," I tried to figure out what made me so angry. I mean, I have seen my fair share of bad movies: "Judge Dredd," "Resident Evil," "Rocky 5" and even "Street Fighter," but this was different. 

This movie was accepted by the American public, at some point it was the number one film in the country. 

The producers were even planning on making a sequel. 

How can this be? How can a movie with such bad writing, acting, and direction become so big? 

This then made me think of the MTV's Video Music Awards. There was something missing from this Year's MTV's Video Music Awards, and that was variety. There were only three rock bands and they all performed at the same time. And they weren't even good. They were Jet, Hoobastank and Yellow Card, the three bands that had big hits this year. Come this time next year they will all most likely be performing at a carwash near you.

But the rest of the show was more of what "You Got Served" was: an attempt by MTV and other big corporations to throw hip-hop in the face of viewers in order to make a buck or two  off the twelve-to-eighteen-year-olds. 

They insist on being called street smart or "gangsta," when the fact is that they have no idea what real people from the street live like. 

Hip-hop culture has become a joke. It used to be that you could get a couple of guys with some talent to make a smart hip-hop album. 

Now anyone can make about three or four million dollars with a rhyming dictionary, a tough and "down" attitide and the illusion of coming  from nothing to become what he is now. 

Now, I don't mind hip-hop, I just mind how all this is affecting the psyche of a lot of young people. 

And by young, I don't mean the children between the ages of six and twelve, but teenagers and twenty-something young adults who think that all they have to do is create an image and get rich. 

It seems as though kids will eventually even stop trying at school or anything in pursuit of talking funny and getting a spot in "the game."

 Everyone thinks they are hip-hop. Even Bruce Willis thinks that by kicking it with his "boi" P. Diddy, that he can appear to be more in touch with the younger people when in fact the only young person Bruce Willis shares anything with is Ashton Kutcher.

But, you know what? Hip- hop makes money. 

Isn't that the only reason why any of this is still going on? If movies like "You Got Served" continue to make money then what's going to happen to cinema? 

Perhaps next year's Oscar winner for best picture will be the sequel to "You Got Served" called "You Got Sizzerved: An Erotic Thriller."

Headline: Spiritual leader speaks on compassion
Subheadline: 14th Dalai Lama revisits FIU, addresses students
Author: Alejandra Diaz and C. Joel Marino / Editor in Chief, News Editor
&nbsp;
Rain fell as the crowd made its way into the Pharmed Arena on Sept. 22, drenching the masses waiting in line since the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, as part of the 2004 Presidential Lecture Series.

Despite his late arrival, the FIU students, faculty and staff stood in the downpour, eventually cramming into the arena to fill its 2,000 plus seats, record attendance for any university community-only lecture.

"The main reason I wanted to go was because it was a chance of a lifetime, something I'd probably never be able to do again," said freshman Mallory Churchill, who admitted having minimal knowledge of the Dalai Lama's mission and background.

Though some students admitted to not having a full understanding of the Tibetan leader's importance, a major world celebrity's visit to the campus was enough to make them interested in the event.

"I was exhausted so I couldn't be there. But, I was going to go just to say I saw him," said sophomore Natalie Quinn.

Acknowledging this lack of comprehension, Dr. Nathan Katz, a professor in the religious studies program, opened the lecture with a speech on the importance of the Dalai Lama and his contributions to the global community.

"He is perhaps the most beloved personality in the world," said Katz in his introduction. "Part of this is his unique and charismatic personality, but most importantly, here in America, the Dalai Lama is a symbol, just as he is for Tibetans...of spirituality, human rights, and peace."

Both Katz, a follower of the Jewish faith, and the Dalai Lama made note of their mutual friendship, a relationship they've maintained since the FIU professor first met the religious leader in India during the '70s. The two have met on regular occasions since then, the Dalai Lama first visiting FIU in 1998 on the professor's request.

Before the actual lecture, musician Nestor Torres, a practicing Buddhist, debuted a special performance in honor of the Dalai Lama. Entitled "On the Sutra of the Lotus of the Wonderful Law," the piece featured melodies inspired by Buddhist writings.

As his flute played and the rain tapped against the arena, some could see the Dalai Lama in the background, staring at the crowd from a window.

Freshman Kristin Pino, who refered to the event as something she will never forget, felt content with her decision to attend the lecture.

"It seemed like it was going to be something very interesting, the chance to see something different," she said.

At 10:45 a.m., over half an hour later than scheduled, the revered leader finally made his way unto the stage.

Smiling and shielding his eyes from the glare of the stage lights, he sat on a large, red couch after bowing to an audience that received him with wild applause and standing ovation.

"I am always happy to exchange words with the younger generation," the Dalai Lama said in a brief introduction. As he began his lecture, "Compassion as the Source of Happiness," the Dalai Lama looked often into the crowd, delivering his speech in a mix of Tibetan and English with a translator by his side.

At the core of his message was the Dalai Lama's conviction that love and kindness towards all human beings is the true source of personal joy. 

"As a human being, everyone has the right to live happily. We all have the right to live a happy life," he often said.

After discussing such topics as human fear, the purpose of intelligence and the ultimate worthiness of kindness, he finished his stay at FIU by answering audience questions.

During these, he made reference to the idea that there may not be another Dalai Lama after his death, a fact that manifested itself after China's invasion of Tibet forced the head of state to escape to India in 1959 at age 24.In exile since then, the spiritual leader of the dispersed Tibetan Buddhists has often said it may be time for his country to one day embark on a more democratic path.

After hearing his hour long discourse, some students felt their perception of the world celebrity might have changed.

"He was very happy, very talkative-a very funny guy," said Pino. "I didn't expect that at all. I expected an old Tibetan monk that could barely talk, and it turned out he was quite the opposite."

As the crowd dispersed from the arena, walking under the slowly fading showers, it was this shift of perceptions that came to some students' minds.

"What I found more interesting was how personable he was, how he seemed real, as opposed to the figure I thought he was," said Churchill. "I thought he'd be kind of more rigid and business-like, as opposed to a moral person comfortable with humor and with what he believes in."

Her assessment of the revered icon was a simple one.

"Overall, he was just a happy man."

Headline: Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow
Subheadline: Jude Law soars into retro computer generated action flick
Author: Arturo Sande / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Every once in a while a film comes along that is unlike any we have seen, and for a change, is fun, fresh, original and does not take itself too seriously. "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is such a film.

First, it must be said that "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" exists as a film because films like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy exist. So great the passion, excitement and imagination of its filmmaker that we are instantly transported to the imaginary world of the film and are allowed to escape and to roam free inside of it.

Jude Law is Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan, pilot-extraordinaire and vanquisher of evil and Gwyneth Paltrow is Polly Perkins, obsessed reporter and sometime partner-in-adventure of Sky Captain. 

Does that sound like a tagline from a '40s matinee serial? You are beginning to get the idea of this movie.

In the film, Manhattan has come under attack by giant mechanical robots sent by the mysterious Dr. Totenkpof, a German scientist bent on world domination. 

Dr. Totenkpof is also kidnapping the leading scientists of the time and his metal men are virtually indestructible.

It is up to Sky Captain and Polly to team up and stop him. In the process we travel to Nepal, Sangri-la and the bottom of the sea. 

The heroes are aided in their plight by Franky (Angelina Jolie), a sexy pilot and old flame of Sky Captain, and Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), who built Sky Captain's amazing plane, along with an array of super-cool, advanced weapons.

By design, the movie looks, feels and sounds like a serial. There is cliffhanger after cliffhanger and Sky Captain's origins are never established. 

He just answers the call whenever evil arises and emerges in his plane from his secret lair to eradicate it. 

It is the inspirations of other classics, however, that are a beauty to behold; the Oz-like power behind Dr. Totenkpof's nefarious scheme, the Metropolis-inspired city of Manhattan, the "Journey to the Center of the Earth" feel to Totenkpof's mysterious island. 

We will not remember the character of Sky Captain in twenty years like we remember "Indiana Jones" today but the performances in the film are very good nonetheless. 

Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are particularly good with their will-they, will-they-not interactions. 

Law walks away with the better performance as he imbues Sky Captain with charm and innocence.

 First time director Kerry Conran wrote the script and spent six years inventing and perfecting the software needed to create the look and effects of the film. 

The movie was made shooting everything against a blue screen with only the actors and props physically present on set. 

Everything else on the screen, including cars,  was added later in the digital process. 

We can only hope this film inspires more filmmakers to work at this level of creativity and brilliance. 

If more films turn out like this one, it will be a welcomed change.

Headline: Giorgi: Introducing Giorgi
Subheadline: Talented young singer still has a long way to go
Author: Elena Bellon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Giorgi presents an interesting taste of what is typical on the Miami music scene. The pop industry has surely spread and obtained much fanfare throughout the decade and Giorgi is not mutually exclusive of this new trend.  

The young singer's demo, Introducing Giorgi shows her vocal talent, though its lyric content is less than inspiring or genius.  

While sampling Giorgi's first few songs I was, unfortunately less than impressed.  

I did not find any real innovation within the songs themselves and felt as though they fell flatly in the all too common category of this "crowd-pleasing" new music phase.  

I use the term "music" quite loosely because while it is, for the most part, a matter of taste there are some standards that should at least be considered when creating new music.  

Giorgi's demo hardly presents itself with such standards or qualities that would move someone to feel anything. The song content was trite enough, ranting over some boy that is "bad news" in her first song on the CD "A Boy Like That." 

 Perhaps, Giorgi's CD would have been done  justice had her CD been reviewed by someone partial to predictable lyrics and poppy rhythm. Her second song, "If it's too Late" does not exactly save the day either.  

Once again we are bombarded with the unsurprising theme of girl chasing boy or wanting his love or attention.  In her third song "You" there is little difference thematically. Still, she is a girl hungry for this special someone's love.  

Because the lyrics are so disappointingly dull, the demo lacks emotional content and in place of qualities that make a song good, there are words such as "angel" and "darling" that strip any possibility of a deeper connection with the music.

Her final song on the album is a remake of Whiney Houston's "I Wanna Dance with Somebody."  Though the words remain unaltered and the general rhythm is closely similar to the original, there is the extra element of a faster-paced tempo. 

One noteworthy idea is the fact that Giorgi?s style of singing does not change very much throughout the CD.  She sounds as though she is quite passionate about every particular circumstance presented in the songs.  

This technique is not very ingenious because it suggests and supports my notion of there being hardly any distinct songs on the entire CD. 

The songs are incredibly starving  for identity which calls into question Giorgi's validity as an artist.  

Shouldn't an artist have some notion of uniqueness within her passions?  

Thus, I feel that when new artists such as Giorgi are introduced to the public, one very paramount skill they lack within their work is an ability to produce distinctions between separate items of their work that may render them innovative and fresh with a desire for change and a refusal to be classified.  

Though I deeply criticize Giorgi's taste in music, I will not deny that her words, so dull and so lacking in emotion, flow from her mouth with a sound worthy of praise. 

Indeed, she sings well.  She has been compared to an early Beyonce, which may very well be the case, for I am not familiar with early recordings of the aforementioned superstar.  

Though not overly soft, she does possess the gift of coarser sound, which would be to her benefit because it will provide her with a little more edge and personality when performing on stage.

Headline: Viktor Vaughn2: Venomous Villain
Subheadline: Hip-hop artist MFDoom explores new personality
Author: Jarros Miller-Dean / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Clouds swell like time bomb sponges, ready to explode rain over the city. Thunder slashes shards of fainting light in the sky like razor a blade. In the heart of Queens, NY lies an abandoned warehouse. While diving deep beneath the surface, below the sewers and rubble lays a laboratory. 

The smell of a half-dead roach shriveling to a slow death burns in an ashtray on the edge of the sound board. Half-empty beer bottles clump together like 40 ounce glass platoons on the floor. Records swell the shelves lining the walls, the access stacked skyscraper high in all corners of the lab. 

In the sound booth, a  metal-faced figure lurks in the shadows. A flutter of light reveals a quick reflection from a metal masked MC as he fades back into the shadows, spitting sharp sinister rhymes from a notebook. Is this Viktor Vaughn or is it MFDoom? Treachery is afoot.

Known for using various aliases such as Zev Love X, King Gheedora and Victor Vaughn to express different sides of his personality, MFDoom once again appears from the shadows to cause chaos as Viktor Vaughn the mysterious MC in Venomous Villain.

 The ever-changing Doom, took a different direction in the creation of this album. 

Instead of re-teaming up with super producer Madlib to create another MadVilliany (Stones Throw Records 2004), he left the rigorous work in the hands of System D-128, DiViNcI, Swamburger, Session 131 and Dub-L. This virtually unknown motley crew tweaked and manipulated knobs and switches to create beats so complex, that only the venomous villain himself could decipher them.

The album opens with the introduction "Viktomizer." A collage of movie and old Fantastic Four episodes describe the return of Vaughn. The mystery begins to unfold as cuts suggest that Doom and Vaughn are not the same person. 

"Vik, I thought I recognized you/I thought you were someone I knew, the same build..."

"Back End" introduces Vaughn machine gunning lyrics over a spaced-out beat. Symbols bend and stretch, as sinister chimes twinkle in and out like stars and drums run hurdles in the background. 

Doom later trades verses with the legendary Kool Keith on "Doper Skill." The two ride the rusty rails that seem reminiscent of a previous beats by Dan the Automater. 

Interludes end and slide into each track, as samples further ponder the question of "Who is Viktor Vaughn?" The question is answered as Doom spews a drunken monolog about the two on, "Doom on Vik." 

He describes Vaughn as a hungry young MC willing, by hook or crook, to make his mark on hip-hop.

VV2 is cleanly produced and neatly packaged. It almost seems too perfect for the introverted Doom's usual stylings. This fact alone coincides with rumors of Doom having little to no input on the album's creation. It also explains the maraud of guest appearances by Man Child, Carl Kavorkian, Poison Pen, Iz-Real and Kool Keith.  

Even though, the small army of MC's spans more than half the album, Doom, never seizing to amaze, explodes in all directions like a barrage of shrapnel.              

A bonus remix of the MF Doom/Iz-Real coloration, "Pop Quiz" can be found as a secret track at the end of the album. After releasing it on the Mic Planet Sessions LP, Doom teamed up with the hip-hop magazine/ record label, Insomniac Inc. If played in a cd-rom, a mini-movie made by the label can be viewed.

While MF Doom reaps havoc, causing a cluster of rhyming sprees, the only question that still remains is, when will he strike next?

Headline: Furry Frenzy
Subheadline: Animal lovers strive for recognition
Author: Nicholas J. Ronda / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Being part of an organization contributes to the college experience for many students. The most commonly joined by students are fraternities and sororities. 

There are many positives to going Greek. From their community service persuits and foot loose weekend activities to their promise to better the individual, being affiliated is enriching. 

Not everyone however, is fit for the t-shirts that fraternities and sororities give to their members. 

Among us live a group of folks who don't feel like they belong no matter how much diversity campus organizations offer. To them, these groups are totally different species.

This is the sentiment shared by Okeen Zenoj and fellow Furries alike. Zenoj is an international business major and, with hope, the member of a potential furries federation.  

A furry has anthropomorphic traits (giving human qualities or characteristics to an animal character). Bugs Bunny, Scooby Doo, Woody Wood Pecker, McGruff the Crime Dog, even that bird from the "Trees are Terrific" commercials are all examples of furry characters.

Furries have always had an affinity for such characters. A childhood attachment toward a cartoon or admiration for a particular animal they want to be is something they all share in common.

For Zenoj it was his zoological encounters that set him on his path toward being a furry.

"As a kid I lived near Metro Zoo and I remember just sitting there watching the turtles in their pen - incredible," Zenoj beams. "These guys are cool, calm and collected at all times. They're in no hurry and can live longer lives than a human. That's the approach I wanted toward life and I feel the turtle best represents it, so now I represent the turtle."

Laughter and ridicule are the usual reactions furries receive by outsiders. To the ignorant, furries are oddities dressed up in animal suits. 

"People see us and think we're insane or calling for attention. But wearing a furry suit allows us to express our inner selves and be comfortable about who we are. Representing an animal we respect is our way," adds Zenoj.

Furry communities are quickly growing globally thanks to the Internet. The emptiness they once felt by the inability to share their animalistic indulgences is now quenched by websites and conventions held throughout the world. 

Conventions are what initiated Zenjo's idea of founding a furry federation.

"I went to the Midwest FurFest prior to my freshman year and while talking to a rabbit and squirrel I thought to myself:

This is awesome. Look at all these people that are just as passionate about this as I am. How awesome would it be to convene with these people not just at annual conventions, but all the time?" Zenoj said.

When arriving back into town, Zenoj contacted known furries on campus. At first, there was concern that there might not be a strong enough contingency to bring his idea to fruition but support quickly mounted.

"This country is founded on dreams brought to life by people who naysayes felt were ridiculous. Initially, I was nervous, but we received a ton of positive feedback. This is an exciting time to be a furry. This thing is going to be dynamite," Zenoj said.

The goal is to eventually organize fraternities and sororities, in a similar manner. Zenoj doesn't think a furry federation would be competition for the Greeks, but "an avenue for those who have always wanted to unleash the bronco within them."  

Ideally there would be a working relationship between the Greeks and furries that would enable all to pursue a common goal of bettering society and other activities.

"It would be special for everyone if all organizations would participate in one another's events. It would really put a happy face sticker on this thing to see the fraternity and sorority members dressed up as their respected animal and enjoying a furfest with us," said Zenoj.

First thing's first; however, before a furry federation can play kickball with the frat boys, they need to establish an organization. 

Although there is plenty of support from furries all over, there has been little action taken to commence the process. 

Zenoj attributes the delay to the extensive research being conducted on all the requirements needed to form the federation. 

That might not be the only dilemma they face. Will other students accept such an organization though?

"A what? You're kidding right? Those guys are going to get their [rears] kicked dressing up like a raccoon or hamster or whatever," said an unimpressed sophomore, Tito Santana.

The fact that it is even being debated illuminates hope. 

"If you would have told me three years ago that we'd be sitting here today talking about the possibility of forming a furry federation at school, I would have accused you of eating silly putty from the toxic container," said furry David Manzanares.

Where better to start something fresh and new than in the place that offers a new beginning in life for many  like than South Florida.

"South Florida has what it takes to be the Mecca for furry federations in the collegiate circuit," Manzanares said. "With all our diversity and fashions, wearing a furry suit isn't even the wildest thing on South Beach."
