Headline: In Our View: SGC officials do not deserve free housing
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
This week, during a meeting between members of FIU's student government and other administrators at Biscayne Bay, one of the discussed bills was put on hold. This bill would grant Biscayne Bay President Adrian Carter and Vice-President Alexander Lewy free housing at BBC.

The reasoning for the bill is that Carter and Lewy are required to travel extensively between both campuses in order to do their jobs and provide services to students. In addition, Carter said the free housing would not result in an extra fee for students.  

Regardless of whether or not this would affect students financially, is this free housing really necessary?  

The argument itself is flawed. What distinguishes the BBC president and vice president from the countless other student leaders required to travel between UP and BBC? Simply because they are required to travel extensively between campuses to do their jobs doesn't necessarily mean they should be given access to free housing.

This kind of thought is just plain illogical. Most students, especially those who hold similar leadership positions, can argue that they are required to drive back and forth between the two campuses and that the drive is burdensome. How are they any different from the BBC SGC president and vice president?  If we give them free housing, we're paving the way for abuse of our housing system by any student who can make similar arguments.

If Carter and Lewy get free housing, any students who deal with the headaches of traveling between campuses in order to attend classes and study should get free housing. They need to remember that FIU is a commuter school. It's unfair and insulting to the students Carter and Lewy were elected to represent to stick their hands in the money pot so they can avoid the hassles and costs the rest of us deal with.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Ignorance corrupts American attitudes toward Islam
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor:

I am writing in response to the hate-filled letter printed in the Sept. 17 edition by Julianne Liberty.

She begins by saying that Islam is an "alien" religion in America. Ms. Liberty would be wise to check the latest numbers on Muslim-Americans –the grand total is six million in this country. Islam is also the fastest growing religion in America, and no where in this great country of ours is anyone being forced to convert.

She goes on to mention, in a very racist and hate-filled tone, how Muslim extremists in other lands are committing atrocities against people of other faiths. This is an extremely biased viewpoint and very limited in scope at that. 

Ms. Liberty seems to be very unaware of the many Americans who have homes in or are living in Middle Eastern or Muslim nations, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Morocco and Jordan. 

Non-Muslims in those countries live there peacefully alongside Muslim neighbors. I've actually had the pleasure of meeting many non-Muslim Americans who have traveled to those countries and told me of the wonderful time they had there and the delightful hospitality they enjoyed.

She also does the usual job of attaching terrorism to every single Muslim. So, in her baseless theory whenever a Muslim commits a terrorist attack, all Muslims, no matter where they live, are a part of this crime. 

When the Spanish Inquisition took place and Muslims and Jews were forced to convert or be killed, did this represent the values of Christianity? For a more recent example, when extreme Christian fundamentalists killed abortion doctors, did this represent all Christians? 

You get my point, I hope.

Every religion has rules that govern the moral code of its followers, and no religion, no matter how little we may know about it, condones the killing of innocent people. I feel appalled that in this day and age I have to actively defend my faith from being associated with terrorism and murder. 

No Christian has to defend the atrocities committed in the name of their religion, whether in the past or recently. It is assumed that this has nothing to do with Christianity. 

However, when a similar crime is committed by a Muslim, then Islam is automatically accused of being a collaborator. 

When a poor Sikh man is shot to death by vengeful Americans after Sept. 11 for simply "looking" like a Muslim, this tells us what little knowledge most Americans have of Islam and its followers. 

I simply urge my fellow Americans to read about Islam and to learn about a faith that over one billion people in the world practice. 

Islam is not America's worst enemy – ignorance is.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Middle-Eastern conflicts threaten American principles
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the editor: 

In a time when we are supposed to be "One nation, under God," it seems that we are divided about something. While some of us like our civil and constitutional rights just the way they are, others like them southern fried and scrambled.

Ever since Bush and Congress got up and voiced their solidarity as a Christian nation under God, we have increasingly become more of a threat to Arabs, Sikhs and Indians in our country as well as a menace to Arabs across the world. 

Meanwhile, in preparation for the impending war on Iraq, a military man was quoted as saying, "It is God's job to forgive, we just arrange the meeting." 

This is one of the many popular opinions that prove our "one nation under God" sentiment has caused more harm than good.

Some people wonder why Newdow is so adamant in his position to keep the phrase "under God" out of America's pledge. Some wonder why the ACLU and other organizations are constantly fighting for the separation of church and state at all costs. The reason is that the marriage of church and state affects not just Americans, but the entire world. 

Countries controlled primarily by their religious constituents create horrible dictatorships, and their corrupt governments act with impunity. Child abuse, pedophilia, and slavery are common, and education is reserved only for the bourgeois. The loss of civil rights is just the beginning. 

With Islamists constantly crying "jihad," can you imagine how fast religious constituents in America would cry Armageddon if Church sentiment takes over the most technologically advanced military in the civilized world? Once the church mixes with American government, the world may plunge back into the Dark Ages. World War III may be right around the corner.

Of course, no one really likes to listen to the voice of reason during these emotionally charged times. Don't get me wrong; I love my country just as much as the next person. I went to donate blood on Sept. 11, and I shed a few tears that day. It is because of my patriotism that I'm being honest with my countrymen and standing up for the truth even though it is unpopular right now.

When one notices the frequency in which religious sentiment gets mixed into war and how it has created such horrific deeds in world history, one cannot help but notice that America is going toward the same direction once again. When America goes to war against Iraq, millions of Arabs in America will be alienated just like thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II. 

Some of us won't have much to worry about, but those of us who have Arab friends don't want to see close friends and family lost in the impending domestic version of the war on terrorism and Iraq. 

Furthermore, the proverbial Golden Rule tells us to "do unto others as you would want others to do unto you." I'm sure no one in our country would want some tyrant from overseas threatening to blow us off the map, so why should we work toward doing that to someone who hasn't done anything to any of us.

I know other people know this and agree with me; they are just scared to say so, just as I am. 

However, the problem is not Iraq – it is Bush and Cheney's Machiavellian quest for oil, and the trillions of dollars in profits in the years that would follow an attack on Iraq's government.

If you are African-American, or Jewish, or a member of a minority, or a female of any race, or gay, or simply an educated individual, you know what oppression does to another culture or race of people. Don't let this kind of capitalist barbarism destroy the 21st century.

Winners

The Miami Dolphins: Finally, the curse has been lifted. After eight straight losses to our conference rivals the New York Jets, we defeated them in a grand fashion this Sunday by a score of 30-3. Congrats guys for giving us something that makes us proud to be from Miami.

Hurricane Isidore: Thanks for steering clear from Florida. Had it hit, this being Sweetwater, we probably would have had to swim to class.  Next time, hopefully we'll get one with just enough rain to cancel classes.

The Emmys: Just when the world was finally getting jaded and fed up with award shows, The Emmys, of all awards, comes back to make the whole thing seem enjoyable. The surprise winners alone ("The Commish's" Michael Chiklis won an Emmy!) made the whole thing worthwhile.   

Losers

Adrian Carter and Alexander Lewy: So let's get this straight. You're chosen by the student body to get a sweet job with a nice paycheck representing them. Then, you decide the school and students should also pay for your housing on top of the pay? Congratulations, gentlemen. You're officially politicians.

FIU Football: Considering your efforts over the past three games, we'll consider this loss a fluke. But that's one heck of a fluke, guys. You were held to 68 offensive yards. Even people who've never heard of football are going "eww."

Payton Williams: End of the first half. You're losing 24-0. What do you do? If you're Payton Williams, you sucker punch the opposing team's quarterback in the face. We may never know exactly why this scuffle happened, but we know it shouldn't have.

Headline: Bush stands to gain from war on Iraq
Author: Andy Diaz
&nbsp;
President Bush is a simple-minded man. I don't mean that negatively – at least not this time. I was one of the people fervently clamoring for war after the events of Sept. 11. In my mind, it was a war between everything that America and I stand for – secularism, tolerance, multiculturalism, intellectualism – and everything the Taliban and al Qaeda violently tried to legislate to the world – murderous undemocratic theocracy, oppression of dissent and the arts, sexism and racism. At the time, I couldn't praise Bush enough for his actions after Sept. 11.

The president's same simple mindedness now brings him to a confrontation with his father's arch nemesis, Saddam Hussein. It took me a while to comprehend why the White House would expand a very popular war (especially in the eyes of the international community) into Iraq. The answer lies in Bush's garbled understanding of how beneficial a successful war can be to a president. 

It isn't hard to realize that a decision to invade Iraq is politically motivated – especially considering that the most recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, conducted between Sept. 13 and Sept. 16, showed 57 percent of Americans in favor of using ground troops to remove Saddam Hussein from power.  It is not a course of action motivated by the more noble notion of self defense.

By mid-2002, the war in Afghanistan was quickly losing support in the United States and abroad. Failure to bring Osama bin Laden (and Taliban Supreme Commander Mullah Mohamed Omar) to justice was a big factor. In a way, the fact that there is no information about bin Laden makes him a more powerful figure to his fanatical Muslim followers. He is no longer a human being, but a nosferatu myth that has managed to escape the American might in a way that only someone of a divine nature would be able to – a Muslim Keiser Soze of sorts. This is the kind of complex situation President Bush is not able to deal with. 

There's no way the White House could deal with this situation in a manner that wouldn't result in embarrassment. If bin Laden is alive, he is intelligent enough to never show his face ever again. If he was killed in the bombing raids over Tora Bora, then al Qaeda realizes that by not distributing a communiqué to its cells saying that he is dead, the myth of bin Laden helps their cause.

The White House's decision to change its focus from bin Laden to Hussein is a politically (although not ethically, as is often the case) sound one. Iraq's recent announcement that it will fully comply with the United Nations' inspections is another blow to Bush's thin logic supporting an invasion of Iraq. By allowing inspectors back into his country unconditionally, Hussein has, at best, discredited the White House's argument that Iraq is building weapons of mass destruction with the intention of using them, and at the least, he has stalled an invasion long enough for the international community to lose interest. 

The Bush administration's attempts to link Iraq to international terrorism and al Qaeda have also proven unsuccessful. Hussein is a strong opponent of the sort of Muslim theocracies usually associated with al Qaeda and similar terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, and has fought their supporters in Iraq and neighboring countries ever since he took power.

The only account of Iraqi terrorism that seems to hold any water is documented in a State Department report of an Iraqi plan concocted in 1993 for an assassination of then President George Bush – but that was almost 10 years ago and it never came to fruition.    

Unlike the fanatical followers of Osama bin Laden, Hussein believes in self-preservation. He authorized an invasion of Kuwait in 1990 because he thought the United States would, if not support the move (as it did with the war against Iran), at least turn a blind eye. Hussein is aware that aggression of that magnitude would result in an invasion of Iraq and in his own trial before an international tribunal, which would undoubtedly find him guilty.

I am by no means a supporter of Hussein's rule, but Bush's moral relativism doesn't sway me. The White House has failed to publicly bemoan similar injustices to their own people in countries like Saudi Arabia – where human rights are widely disregarded, and ties to terrorist organizations are not uncommon occurrences – simply because of their status as allies

Ultimately, the White House is trying to recreate the air of moral righteousness that fueled so many of our country's actions after the attacks of Sept. 11. Hussein has taken no aggressive action against his neighbors or the United States in the last 10 years. 

This doesn't mean that he's not able to do so. It simply means that he's too afraid to do it. He has experienced the full-on might of the American war machine once already, and would not be stupid enough to provoke it again, especially since he must understand that if he does, his head would be on the line.

Headline: Disrespectful students ruin Biscayne Bay memorial
Author: Kara Grant
&nbsp;
Rude. Obnoxious. Noisy. Disrespectful. Shameful. Oblivious. These are all the adjectives that come to mind when I think about the memorial held this year by the Biscayne Bay Campus at FIU regarding Sept. 11. The meeting itself was beautiful, but it would've been nice if I could've actually heard what was being spoken. 

It started with the Vice Provost Raul Moncerz calling everyone's attention to the singing of "The Star Spangled Banner." Abigail Mary sang this song beautifully and loudly so that everyone in the Panther Square in the WUC Building had no choice but to stop and listen. Her voice was the last audible thing I heard in that memorial.

From there it seemed people all over the building were talking, moving and carrying on as the rest of the service continued. Many people, including myself, glared at the students causing the noise, to no avail. 

I decided to sit in the back row knowing I would leave early and not wanting to cause a distraction. The service didn't start until 12:30 giving students, faculty and guests plenty of time to arrive and settle down. There were groups of people standing around, people eating and talking on the second floor next to the cafeteria (directly above the service), and tables set up in the back of the service selling cell phones and accessories. When we had our moment of silence, the building still had commotion going on. 

After a few short speeches, about six individuals went on stage to read poems of peace in different religions. It was an emotional setup, but the environment was so chaotic I doubt anyone could really enjoy it. 

After the poetry was read, another young lady went up and sang a hymn. It was difficult to hear her above the noise so I closed my eyes and said a prayer hoping to tune out the distractions. After all this was done, a priest went up and gave a sermon about the tragedy of Sept. 11 and why God allowed it to happen. After 15 minutes of the service I couldn't stand it so I left. Others did the same, but no one seemed to notice.

I was furious at the disrespect shown by the community of FIU's north campus. I can't pinpoint any particular group, students and faculty alike walked past the service. Some quieted as they realized what was going on, but the noise and commotion continued. I was heartbroken. 

Sept. 11 isn't just something that occurred in New York last year, it's a tragedy that changed our nation. 

I was thrilled to find out BBC was giving a service in honor of Sept. 11; it seems as if UP has all the excitement and activities of the two campuses. 

Yet, few seemed to care and there were many empty seats in this service. Have we already forgotten how a part of our nation and its citizens were destroyed? After I spoke with some friends about the rudeness shown at this service, someone told me that some have expressed the attitude to get over it. 

Is this how students and faculty feel about Sept. 11? If so, that's no reason to act like this when others attend a service to uphold and honor those that died on Sept. 11.

Sept. 11 should be a day when we stop for one moment out of our daily routines and just think about the people who died that day in 2001. Not everyone has to light a candle, or wear red, white and blue, or go to a memorial service at school, work, or church, or recite the Pledge of Allegiance. 

Everyone should, however, be respectful of those who choose to do these things. I'm proud to be an FIU student and I hope that the next memorial the north campus holds will be held with more respect.

Headline: Editor reflects on past love
Author: Javier Ruiz / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
"We have to talk," she says to me over the sound of the jukebox singing sweetly "No woman no cry."  She found the flowers at the door of her apartment and the card I wrote. "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever been given. We have to talk." 

I hear it all too clear, even over the jukebox, even over the alcohol's numb-hum. I hear every word she says. 

The moment comes and the moment is uncomfortable. Where do we start? How to come out with it? But we stumble to it surely enough. Stumble, walk, run, fall. We sit face-to-face, peel it off, like an onion at first, thin and fragile, but later like an orange in jagged pieces, ripped free, the pulp showing a little, your eyes watering a bit.

And there is love. Sure enough, we both knew it. Kind of knew it all along, but we're friends too, and it's not easy facing up to that. You care too much; feel too much. But you say too little, and in that way the days go by.

And so we're here, talking it out after all. Fleshing it out with hearts heavy from too many sideways glances, too many smiles, too many quiet moments and caresses. Too many lines crossed, but not overtly. I tell her I love her. Three words, and all that need be said on my behalf. Three words that carry more on their backs than Atlas.

"I can't give you what you want. Not now. I'm not ready for that," she says.

Of course there are reasons why. Really, you can always find reasons why if you try. She can't see her life without me, she says. The friendship is too valuable. And it is. It really is, and I can't see my life without her. But I can't see her and not love her.

So we can't speak for love. We know it's there, we both feel it, but she can't give it because love is never yours to give. And I can't win it because you can't conquer the heart: only surrender it.

But we can still be friends can't we? I'd like to say yes, but I don't want to lie.  I don't know. There are two roads here, and both are treacherous. On the one side, I can walk away forever, and in that way lose this love forever. 

On the other hand, we can stay friends. But how can I smell her, see her, and not remember? Feel the cold embrace of friendship and not remember? And hold on in that way until it's all gone cold and in that way lose it forever? There are two roads and both are bitched. Pick your poison, a bitter pill either way.

She asks if I believe in fate, and I say no, but I don't want to lie. So I take it back and tell her I don't know. Real men don't believe in fate. Real men are always in control. But all this time I held my tongue waiting for some fated moment that never came. So maybe some part of me does, or wants to believe. 

I could say that this was fated. Leave it at that and think nothing more of it. That's not good enough. I know that what made those moments special wasn't just written in some cosmic book, waiting to run its course and be done, the result of some pre-determined mechanical process. I know I wasn't following some script written by the gods. I know that it was me that gave meaning to life, to love. And in that way, those moments were warm and real and mine. Fate leaves me cold, steals it all away. It robs the warmth, the passion, the purpose. 

Fate is a cop-out. Hold off, don't act, and when nothing goes right, blame fate. After all, everything happens for a reason, right? 

Such a convenient philosophy. Too convenient really, and I'm not buying into it anymore. I'm not waiting for any more fated moments.

She's missed her ride, and I see her circling the parking lot. I offer her a ride. She asks how I knew she'd need one. Knew. I'd give my life if only to be her guardian angel.

Headline: Stevens continues to build Volleyball program
Author: Daisy Fernandez/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coach Dulcie "Cookie" Stevens is prepared to take on her fourth season at FIU. This Brooklyn-born volleyball expert plans to surpass last year's success. She will push the team to go beyond their championship in the 2001 Sunbelt Conference.  

Long before Stevens became a coach at FIU, she learned to play volleyball with her sixth-grade P.E. teacher. She later attended Monsignor Edward Pace High School in Hialeah. Her tall stature (Stevens is 6'0") allowed her to play middle blocker and hitter. Her accomplishments in these positions raised her to the college level. She began at Miami-Dade Community College and scaled to San Diego State University, where she continued to shine athletically.

Volleyball became more than a passion for Stevens: it was a helpful teacher. In the gym, she learned unique strategies that she could apply to everyday life. "Being in a team has taught me life lessons, like conflict resolution and problem solving techniques," Stevens said.

The demands of the court encouraged her to excel in academics as well. She graduated from FIU in 1981 with a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies. By 1989 she moved to earn a Master's in Physical Education from Nova Southeastern University.

Her years playing volleyball made her a master of the sport. In 1979 her 
role changed from most valuable player to head coach. She coached for almost two decades at Miami-Dade Community College before transferring to Westminster Christian School. Four years ago, she landed at FIU to rescue women's volleyball.

It took Stevens only three years to transform the FIU team. Last season they came out of their underdog status to become real winners. Her proudest moment in volleyball is exactly this event. Guiding the team to the Sunbelt Conference Championship in 2001 was an incredible feat for Stevens. As a coach, she has also won a number of honors. One hangs in her office the: NCAA Division I South Region Coach of the Year Award. 

Outside her coaching career, Stevens enjoys taking care of her family. 

Stevens has been married for the last 19 years to photographer Pete Stevens. 

Her proudest, most rewarding achievement in life has been being a mother to her two teenage sons, Sam and Kyle. 

With her husband, she has successfully raised this pair of athletic boys. 
On her free time, she likes to hang out with her sons and play tennis. Sam, the oldest of the two, will attend Ohio State University to play volleyball. According to Stevens, "[Her sons] have grown up in the gym and learned the game well." 

It is no wonder they have the talent to be future volleyball stars.
As far as the upcoming season goes, Stevens has high expectations for her team. She would like to see the volleyball players win the Sunbelt Conference again and go a few steps further. Although they will face the challenges of a much stronger schedule and higher rank teams, Coach Stevens is determined to make it happen this fall.  

She believes the team has outstanding potential on its own and the players have positive chemistry, great work ethic, and competitiveness. 
These qualities, combined with her intense practice routines, should leave the volleyball team limitless.    

Stevens could have made millions jealous when she admitted, "I love my job. I couldn't be any happier. I have it made." 

For her, being a part of the FIU athletics program, which is headed up by Athletic Director Rick Mello, has been a blessing. 
She feels well supported. 

The only thing she seems to be missing is support from the student body. 
"I hope students realize how well the athletics program at FIU is doing." 
"I urge them to come support our team and other sports."

Headline: Bethune-Cookman shuts out FIU
Author: Mike Hernandez / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panther's suffered a loss this week against No. 24 ranked Bethune-Cookman, giving up 251 rushing yards in a performance reminiscent of their first loss at Elon in which they surrendered 377 rushing yards. Seventy-one of B-CC's rushing yards came at the hands of Junior Quarterback Allen Suber in the 31-0 shut out at Fort Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium in the first-ever South Florida Classic. 

"It wasn't like they did anything different that we didn't plan on," head coach Don Strock said. "It's just that they are a better team than us at this moment." 

Suber was as good as advertised running the "Wyatt-bone" offense. He completed 10-of-15 passes for 179 yards and led the B-CC offense to 470 yards on the afternoon. The FIU defense had no answer for the rushing attack. The Wildcat offense was so in-sink, they held a 24-0 lead at the half. 

The two bright spots on the defensive side of the ball for FIU were Jermell Weaver, who led the defense for the second consecutive week with nine tackles, and Nick Turnbull  who had two interceptions.

The frustration began to show when defensive end Payton Williams was ejected from the game for punching Suber near the end of the first half. 
Williams admitted that he hit the much smaller Suber (5'10, 186 pounds). Suber accused the FIU sideline of being the instigator. 

"I don't know if their coaches teach them to do that or what because their coaches were screaming at me and calling me a coward," Suber said.

"I didn't see it happen," Strock said. "We're going to look at the tape, and if [Williams] did do it, you can bet he won't be playing next week."

"Defensively in the first half, it looked like we were running in cement," Strock stated. "It's back to the drawing board. They played better than us and they won the football game."

"We felt if we could run well and get Suber started early, that we would be successful," said Bethune-Cookman head coach Alvin Wyatt. "We wanted 30-40 points from our offense and a shutout from our defense. We got both."

The Wildcat defense was stingy and unwilling to allow FIU quarterback Jamie Burke to get in a groove. Burke managed just 18 pass attempts, completing nine and passing for 84 yards. Burke was sacked 11 times while backup David Tabor was also sacked in the fourth quarter when he came in to relieve Burke. 

The Wildcats were in the Golden Panther backfield all day, stopping  the FIU offense for 89 yards in losses on quarterback sacks and to -16 yards rushing. FIU managed  just 68 yards of offense on 52 plays from scrimmage. 

The yardage was the least allowed by B-CC since 1975.

Wyatt stacked eight and nine-man defensive fronts on Burke. This setting confused the entire FIU offense, especially the inexperienced offensive line. 

"There were so many guys coming, at times we lost count," left guard Ed Wenger said. "Everything they showed us is what we practiced all week. We just didn't communicate enough."

"Our offensive line played horribly," Strock said after the game. "We tried to establish the run a little bit in the first half to keep our defense off the field, but we couldn't do that." 

"In the second half, we were more competitive, but there are a lot of things we have to work on offensively, obviously. But we'll go back to work on Monday and get ready for Georgetown," Strock said. 
"That's the great thing about college football, you get to do it again next Saturday."

The Golden Panthers suffered several injuries to key players. Rashod Smith, last week's Division I-AA Player of the Week after tallying 116 yards rushing, has bruised ribs. Defensive lineman Chris Horne and linebacker Shaun Dudney suffered right ankle sprains. Another defensive lineman, Terrence Allen, was diagnosed with a left knee contusion and James Knapp had a left hand contusion. All were slated to be re-evaluated on Sunday. 

The attendance was 16,386, making it the second-largest crowd for FIU to play in front of.

FIU takes on Georgetown this Saturday at home.

Jennifer Owens (Miami/Braddock) led the Golden Panthers with 9 kills, 8 digs and a .353 attack percentage.

FIU (4-7) couldn't overcome its own mistakes in the first game, as the Golden Panthers tied Cornell (4-2) with 38 total attacks, but had an attack percentage of -.184.  
The Big Red took advantage with 12 kills and a 30-22 game one win.

In the second game FIU held its largest lead of the match at 21-14.  
Cornell would fight back by scoring the last 4points of the match to win 31-29.  

The Golden Panthers committed 8 service and attack errors down the 
stretch to help the Big Red.
FIU tied the game at 21, before giving up 4straight points.  

With the Golden Panthers down 27-23, Elizabeth Baldwin won three consecutive service points, to bring FIU within one point.  

That was as close as FIU would get. The Golden Panthers drop to 4-7 on the year.

Headline: Czech president visits FIU
Subheadline: Leader pushes for Cuba's freedom, independence
Author: Hatzel Vela
&nbsp;
Czech President Vaclav Havel made South Florida the last stop in his U.S. visit. Speaking before a capacity crowd of 200 guests yesterday morning, Havel expressed concern and solidarity for the struggle and freedom of the Cuban people. 

"Every modern, freedom-loving person feels, or at least ought to feel, a sense of solidarity both with those who are prevented from living in their home country or from freely visiting it," Havel told the audience. He added that same solidarity should be extended to those who "are forced to live in their country in a state of constant fear, and who cannot leave it and return to it of their own free will."

Havel knows these pressures all too well. 

Once a writer and playwright, he is known as the champion of Czechoslovakian culture. During Czechoslovakia's fight for freedom in 1989, Havel emerged as the leading figure of the "Velvet Revolution," a series of civic uprisings and social upheavals inspired in part by the music of '60s rock band the Velvet Underground that lead to free elections and subsequently removed the communist regime.

"I think one of the most diabolical instruments for subjugating some people and fooling others is the special communist language," Havel said. "It is a language full of subterfuge, ideological jargon, meaningless phrases and stereotypical figures of speech," he added. 

Havel said this language can seem appealing for those who have never felt oppression, but "this very same language can evoke fear and horror and force them (citizens) into permanent state of dissimulation."

He made reference to the experience of his country and its reaction to the communist rhetoric or language. 

"In my country, too, entire generations of people once let themselves be led astray by this kind of language with its fine words about justice, peace and the necessity of fighting against those, allegedly in the interests of evil foreign powers, resisted the power that spoke that language," Havel said.

But Havel claims the language can only last so long.

"When the internal crisis of a totalitarian system grows so deep that it becomes clear to everyone, and when more and more people learn to speak their own language and reject the hollow, mendacious language of the powers that be, it means that freedom is remarkably close," Havel said.

Havel urged the world that it must do more for freedom and that all Cubans should live and enjoy freedom and independence. He recognized Oswaldo Payas Sardinas, a human rights activist and coordinator of the Christian Liberation Movement and creator of the Varela Project. 

"May Oswaldo Payas Sardiñas&#8230;be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and may this award strengthen the courage of all the Cuban people to take up non-violent resistance against an oppressive regime," Havel said.

Francisco de Armas followed Havel and read a letter where Payas, a dissident who currently lives on the island, expressed his current situation.  

"I wish to tell you that we never lost that hope and that you have been a light which has kept that hope alive. That is why today it is more than a dream. It is determination. And it is liberation," de Armas read from Paya's letter.

He continued, "many Cubans are losing their fear, taking off their masks and raising their heads." Paya adds in his letter that change begins when citizens lose their fear because according to him, the regime is founded on fear.

"Liberation is under way in Cuba and just like in Czech, many do not believe it although all desire it," Paya said. 

The Cuban activist wrote that the Varela project was a vanguard and not another mask. He claims it's the mask of the people; it's liberation.

"We will continue the civic campaign of the Varela Project until we have regained our rights," de Armas read from the letter. "No matter what the Regime's reaction may be."

Following de Armas, Ricardo Bofill, Carlos Alberto Montaner, Marifeli Perez-Stable, Tomas Pojar and Jaime Suchlicki spoke as part of a panel discussion.

In a post-press conference, Havel told the press that he wasn't interested in giving people instructions on how to stage revolutions but rather wanted to promote the values associated with human dignity. 

Havel added that even though he didn't know how long it would take for freedom to arrive on Cuban soil, the one important factor is that there are people in Cuba who have the courage to say what they believe.

For 76-year-old Mario Chanaz de Armas, courage is why he feels this event was important.

"This is for the men who are imprisoned, for those who have been forgotten," South Dade resident Chanaz said. 

Chanaz, a Cuban immigrant, is one of the many who spent time as a political prisoner. He added that he understands what it's like and that he knows Cubans are still willing to pay any price for freedom.

Headline: Prints replace student IDs in UCF's gym
Author: Amy Edwards/ Knigh-Ridder Tribune
&nbsp;
ORLANDO, Fla. – University of Central Florida students can now get into the campus' Recreation and Wellness Center using only the tips of their fingers for identification.

It's part of a $150,000 security system that scans points of a fingerprint to identify the student. The goal is to maintain tight security.  

Some students like the new technology because it simplifies their trips to the gym by allowing them to leave their student IDs at home. But others wonder whether the scanning system violates their privacy.

Student Todd McClelland has been using the center since January and said he doesn't plan on having his fingerprint scanned into the system. 

"The cards work perfectly fine," McClelland said.

But most students aren't overly concerned, school administrators said. 

"A few initial people said 'no way' because of privacy issues," said Rick Falco, coordinator of the center. "But once you educate them as to what's really happening, they are OK with it."

The units at UCF scan only points of the fingerprint, Falco said. It then stores a template into the unit. "You can't reprint the fingerprint from the scan," Falco said.

Even with this information, some students remain wary. As an option, one entrance will remain open for those who want to enter with their student ID.

The increasing use of the scanning system known as biometrics nationwide has caught the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union. 

"We are very concerned with the growing use of this technology," said Alessandra Meetze, communications director of the ACLU of Florida. "Our concern is that the students are told exactly what is going on … and told they have an option."

With about 4,500 people using the center daily, security was a top concern for school officials.

"It was initially created to prevent (people) from using IDs that weren't theirs," Falco said. 

When former UCF quarterback-turned-professional football player Daunte Culpepper tried to get into the center, an employee wouldn't let him in because he didn't have an ID. 

Culpepper tried to explain, Falco said, but the employee – a freshman – didn't know the alumnus and remained adamant that everyone must enter with their ID.

When the center first opened, Falco said, his employees were referring five to 10 students a day to judicial affairs for trying to enter with an invalid ID. 

Using the new system, students gain access to the center in a matter of seconds by placing their index fingers on the scanner and then entering an eight-digit code.

It took only a minute for junior Deka Thorne to get scanned into the system recently.

"I think it's cool," Thorne said. "I don't have to work out with my card anymore." 

UCF is one of the first universities in the state to use biometrics in this type of facility, said Marc Spiegel, national account executive for Siemens Building Technology.

"It's going to become mainstream," Spiegel said. "The technology is being implemented all over."

Headline: National dean's list student gets scholarship
Subheadline: FIU graduate Neves plans to work with children, earn doctorate
Author: Saudy Peña/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
An interest that grew out of accompanying her injured father to his physical therapy sessions has come full circle for Roberta Neves.

Just prior to earning her master's degree in physical therapy, FIU student Roberta Neves has recently been named one of this year's recipients of the $4,000 Minority Scholarship Award for Academic Excellence from the American Physical Therapy Association. 

"I found out about the award through their website and the physical therapy department here at FIU," said Neves. "I then wrote an essay about my experience as a minority as well as my aspirations and goals."

Established in 1998, the award honors students who demonstrate evidence of contribution to minority affairs and services, pursue a physical therapy education, and achieve academic distinction with potential for superior professional achievements.

Chosen out of a pool of 35 applicants, Neves was one of the nine students to receive the award.

She has volunteered her time and shown a concern for minority issues, obtained valuable internship experience in the pediatrics and orthopedic aspects of physical therapy, and maintained an outstanding academic record throughout her college career.

"She met the criteria we were looking for," Eva King, the assistant to the APTA director of Minority Affairs, said. "She's a great candidate for the award."

APTA hopes that in recognizing exceptional physical therapy minority students, they will create awareness and promote cultural diversity within the profession itself.

"Out of the 64,000 members that we represent, only 6,000 members are of minority groups," said King. "We want to see their representation grow."

For Neves, who at age 14 faced the struggle of moving to the United States from her home in Brazil, the award comes as another addition to a list of accomplishments she has achieved.

Since enrolling at FIU, Neves has appeared on the national dean's list, been named All-American Scholar, received the Outstanding Student Professional Award and the Outstanding Student Scholar Award.

She was also one of the  finalists for the 2001 FIU Outstanding Life Award for Service.

All this success was not always easy for Neves.

As an immigrant attending high school in Connecticut, Pa., she struggled to learn English. 

Having to integrate herself into a new culture and dealing with rejection for being a minority from the local community were all obstacles she had to face.

"There was a great Portuguese community that helped me deal with the culture shock," said Neves. "It eased the difficulty of getting acquainted with a new country."

Eventually, Neves would more than surpass these hardships and develop a strong passion for the field of physical therapy.

Due to her ongoing interest, Neves plans on pursuing her doctoral degree in the future.

However, she must first choose which area she would like to specialize in. 

Meanwhile, Neves plans to pursue her main interest – working with children in a pediatrics position.

"I love working with kids," Neves said. "I love being able to help them."

Physical therapists have the chance to contribute positively to the quality of people's lives. 

APTA certainly believes Neves has the potential to make such a difference.

"She is a great asset to the physical therapy profession," APTA President Ben F. Massey, Jr. said,  "an ideal candidate."

The Minority Scholarship Award for Academic Excellence from APTA is offered to students enrolled in their final academic year at an accredited or developing professional physical therapist education program such as the one at FIU. 

Students are eligibile for the scholarship upon completion of all degree requirements. They must also graduating seniors the year they receive the award year. APTA is currently accepting applications from students who will graduate in 2003.

Headline: BBC's student government tries to improve student services, combat lack of campus life
Author: Sheaon Reid/ Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In an effort to  address student concerns, Biscayne Bay's Student Government Council met at the Wolfe university Center's Theater Sept. 17. 

All council members were present along with Provost Mark Rosenberg, Student Affairs Assistant Vice President Brian Haynes, Vice Provost Raul Moncarz, Recreational Sports Director Gregory Olsen, Police Chief Jesse Campbell, Hospitality Management Dean Joseph West and Arts and Sciences Associate Dean Joyce Peterson. 

Prior to hearing students' concerns, President Adrian Carter and Vice President Alexander Lewy spoke to the 60 students in the audience. 

"We are working for you, we are your humble servants," Carter said. "We are working closely with administration to change the dreary look and lack of beauty in Academic One. We are fighting to change the lack of school spirit on campus. Moreover, the customer service found on campus needs to be better. SGA will not stand for poor customer service."

Carter addressed other issues that were on the SGC's 2002-2003 action plan.  

Carter said a plan is underway to reduce public transportation fees for students and he also spoke on some academic issues.

"Continuity must be established within the syllabus," he said. "It must have a set standard for all the professors to use as a contract. 

"In the future, we plan to raise $20,000 for our scholarship drive though our Coin Party and implement six new book scholarships – two for in-state students, two for out-of-state students and two for international students."

After they spoke, students were given their turn. 

Clark Fraser, a resident assistant on the Bay Vista Hall Council, wanted an update on the housing bill the council is planning to review. 

The bill, which has already been passed but is on hold for further discussion, was written by Carter himself. It will give the BBC's student council president and vice president free housing. 

Carter said he and Lewy have to travel between campuses and home in order to do their jobs, and said they would be able to serve the students better by being on campus.

Fraser asked if students would see any increases in fees if the bill is put into effect.

"At the moment the bill is on halt," Carter said, "And there would not have been any increase in student fee. We will not spend any money in an unjust way."

Carter also said this would not be into effect until the next year so it can be properly arranged in the budget.

One student complained that students have to pay for parking even if they do not have a car. 

"There is no fee to cover sidewalk and infrastructure," Haynes said. "It has to come from some kind of fee. Moreover, we pay Miami-Dade County for the metro bus to come into our campus. We pay for service to reroute."

Another student showed concern with the absence of the game room. 

"The game room was one way for me and many other students to relax in between classes," junior Handy Mussotte said. 

He asked if there will be a replacement game room any time soon.

"In about 4 weeks, in the area where the game room used to be, we are going to open the new campus life offices," Haynes said. "But at this time we do not have plans to open up a new game room based on the old model. However, we are committed to finding new locations to place pool tables, ping-pong tables and other sources of recreational activities around the campus. Unfortunately, we are not moving towards building a new game room."

Famara Demba, a hospitality management major who is about to start his graduate degree, pointed out the high costs of the GRE and taking graduate courses. 

"To take a 35-hour course, it is $4,000. To take a 25 hour course, it is $3,000 and to take a 15 hour course, it is $2,000," he said. "Is there any possible way that something can be done to lower these costs?"

"GRE is a matter the [Florida Student Association] started looking into just last week," Finance Chair Nicaise Parillon said. "What we are looking at is a discounted rate for FIU students."

Student parking was another issue raised. A student pointed out that even though the parking lot was renovated, it still floods and the issue of insufficient parking still remains. He said the university should have expanded the same time the reconstruction was done. 

Lewy addressed the student's concern.

"I usually attend the parking and traffic meetings held at [UP]," said Lewy. "At the next meeting, I will be sure to bring the issue to Nick Diciacco who is the Executive Director of Business and Finance."

Other issues brought up by the students included vending machines in the Hospitality Management building, the quality of the water in housing, barber shop on campus, insufficient lighting on the basketball courts and unemployment of international students on campus.

Both the students and the council felt positive about the turn out of the town hall meeting. 

"The town hall meeting was a definite success," Carter said. "It was a much better turnout than last year and students were very vocal. We walked away with a lot of info."

"It was good and very productive," hospitality major Camilla Hyppolite said. "Great concerns were raised."

"Overall, it was a good gateway for students to say their opinion," senior Deanna Russell said. "It was a chance to hear future plans and programs they plan to implement and I am anxious to see what's going to happen. They painted a beautiful picture for us."

Headline: Williams breaks mold with "One Hour Photo"
Author: Jay Santiago
&nbsp;
You will never look at your kind, local store employee the same way again after watching "One Hour Photo." In it, Robin Williams gets serious. Brushed aside are the jokes and the stupidity; in their place a somber, mature Williams is developed. The movie was written and directed by first-time movie director Mark Romanek, who became famous doing music videos such as "Scream" by Michael and Janet Jackson as well as Madonna's "Rain," among others. "One Hour Photo" was first shown at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received rave reviews. 

Robin Williams plays Seymour "Sy" Parrish, "the photo guy," a seemingly nice, family-friendly SavMart store employee who works as a photo-lab technician. Sy is both quiet and dedicated to his work. Sy admits that no one takes a picture they want to forget, so he lives his life through pictures that make up his false sense of reality. 

 His devotion to work becomes more eccentrically vigorous with the Yorkin family: Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and their nine-year-old son Jake (Dylan Smith). Sy becomes infatuated with the Yorkin family, making extra sets of their family photos for himself, displaying them in his disturbingly empty apartment. The photos encompass his entire wall, from floor to ceiling. His lonely obsession causes him to visualize himself as part of their family, calling himself "Uncle Sy," and going as far as parking his car in front of their house and entertaining thoughts of breaking in to the Yorkins' home. Sy's fixation leads him to discover unpleasant secrets that alter his perception of reality, or lack thereof. It, in turn, begins a chain reaction of negative occurrences that include Sy getting fired over missing photographs.  

The beauty of this movie is in its production. The mood is defined by its setting and is crucial in creating a sense of uneasiness. 

The film is shot beautifully, using monochromatic, dark, unsettling colors. An undercurrent of violence in Sy's nature is suppressed, allowing you to pity him, while at the same time viewing him as a fanatical maniac. The Yorkins on the other hand are displayed just as they are in their pictures. The "perfect family" is shown in a vibrant array of colors, always smiling and showing affection for one another. 

The two extremes mold into each other very nicely, coming together methodically. The story's silent, subtle nature lends you not to judge, but to watch. 

Williams, in atypical fashion, "acts" disciplined and in turn delivers a convincingly frightening performance. From his light-colored comb over, to his beige Velcro shoes, the movie's realism is unsettling, as is its simplicity.  Although the character is clearly over the edge, his loneliness does not allow you to perceive him as a monster, but rather as a miserable human being. 

His character's obsession enters your head, unnerving you psychologically in ways not seen since Anthony Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs." Unlike "Insomnia," "One Hour Photo" boasts a smooth plot that is both precise and intriguing.  It is most definitely worth your money.

Headline: Violent Femmes revisit classic period
Author: Claudia Ortega / Copy Editor
&nbsp;
Thanks to my older sister, I was exposed to all the music of the '80s that I had missed – the Smiths, Erasure, Dead Can Dance, the Sugarcubes, Yaz and that group whose name I could never remember. The "Blister-in-the-Sun-guys," I called them. They preferred to be known as the Violent Femmes, and out of my sister's collection of various '80s albums, their self-titled album was my favorite.

On June 18, that first album was re-released in a deluxe edition two-disc package to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The original 1982 album made a name for the Violent Femmes and is almost universally considered to be their best album – many critics believe it's the only reason they haven't completely disappeared from the musical lexicon. 

Die-hard fans, of which there are quite a lot, stand by their Femmes of course, but they remain, nevertheless, a kind of underground band. Their contemporaries, among them R.E.M. and 10,000 Maniacs, went on to enjoy the fame and fortune that comes with being commercially successful. Although it's probably not where bands want to be, their niche in the underground adds to their raw appeal.

Until now, my favorite album of theirs was Add It Up (1981-1993), which summed up all their best during that period; this new album though is a good contender for best. Besides the original 10 tracks, which include some of their best known songs – "Blister in the Sun," "Add It Up," and "Gone Daddy Gone,"– the first CD includes eight previously unreleased demos and two UK singles. The second CD boasts 14 live recordings from their early years (all but one previously unreleased as well) and a radio interview with Michael Feldman, currently the host of NPR's "Whad'Ya Know."  

Following the format of Add It Up, the second CD includes between-song chatter, which allows a peek into the relationship between the three musicians. Add that to the fact that all the songs are live, and it's like being at a concert (or as close as you'll get to being at one of those early Femmes concerts).

What the Violent Femmes are best known for is the pervasive theme of teenage angst and frustration in their songs. Of course, now it's weird to see a rather short middle-aged guy still singing his old songs about problems with girls, sex, being outcast and pleading to get the car so he can "entertain" a girlfriend, but I guess you can argue that those are universal problems. 

If you listen to some of the songs, like "Jesus Walking on the Water" and "Black Girls" for instance, there are also a lot of references to religion.  

These references came out of front-man Gordon Gano's background. He was born to a baptist minister. Although conflicts over these songs have risen with the band's atheist bassist Brian Ritchie, they stayed on the albums. Looking at the lyrics on paper, the songs seem like they would be very dark and morbid, but you never get that feeling listening to them, and in their live recordings it's obvious that the crowd is never down and gloomy. 

You could even say that the Violent Femmes led the way for later bands like Nirvana, who made the teen-angst theme popular again in the '90s. With their acoustic folk-punk sound and their engaging lyrics, the Femmes are a real classic and timeless band. Regardless of whether they could follow up the success of their first album or not, they really are a rock staple and should be enjoyed by everyone. 

For those who've never heard of them, the new deluxe edition is a must. It introduces the band through the ground-breaking original album and through the extras, including liner notes by author/journalist Michael Azzerad. 

For those who know of the Femmes, it's a worthy buy because of the 26 extra tracks, most of which can't be found on any other album. For those like me, who have brothers who leave our cherished cassettes on the dashboard of a parked car in sweltering Miami weather, this new release is a necessity.

Headline: Buffy game remains faithful to series
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Although it is clearly a superior console machine in many ways, the X-Box has never quite caught my fancy in the way that the Playstation 2 and GameCube have.  In addition to the initial reports of the machine succumbing to the typical Microsoft flaws (freeze-ups, glitching, feeling like a beta release in desperate need of an "update"), the system didn't exactly seem the friendliest to consumers. Not only was the price steep, but the big cumbersome black box was an intimidating lug next to it's sleek older brothers, the PS2 or the GC, with it's "Hasbro"-esque appealing look. And don't even get me started on the behemoth they call a controller.

But what can clearly be described as the X-Box's fatal flaw is its complete lack of exciting games. Most of the big hit titles have already been swooped up by Sony or Nintendo in exclusivity deals (read: "Grand Theft Auto"), leaving X-Box to pick at the mediocre fighters. These include two or three decent first-person shooters (with "Halo" as the only noticeable standout) and generic, played-out, franchised, already done to death on other consoles games with slightly refined graphics (like "Max Payne" or whatever "Star Wars" flight-sim is out at the moment).

However, three recent events have led me to seriously reconsider the purchase of an X-Box: a price-drop to match it head-to-head with the PS2 in terms of value, the thankful introduction of a smaller controller that doesn't assume the player can palm a basketball and the recent release of the first new, exclusive and really well-titled game, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

Alright, so maybe I'm a tad biased. A year ago I finally fell to the charms of "Buffy" and its top-notch writing. More than just an angsty melodrama with rubber-suit demons, "Buffy" is really all about the character interplay and fresh, intriguing storylines, something that comes off surprisingly well in the video game. The game even manages to tweak its nose at the conventions in video games, much like the show does with the conventions one would expect from a monster-of-the-week show.

Don't take my word for it. Try the game for yourself. It effectively captures the show's mood, tone and sense of humor. The game is about Buffy Summers, a teenager girl whom is chosen as a slayer of demons (including vampires, natch), whom must come face-to-face with some nasty demons including bleach-blonde Brit vampire Spike and a 600 year-old super vampire she killed once before called The Master. 

So you fans know, the game takes place during the third season as a "missing episode," so you have the most developed, fun characters, before Cordelia moved to L.A. and Willow moved to women.

A third-person fighter through massive levels (a la "Tomb Raider"), the engine for "Buffy" is impressive. Graphics are very strong, recreating characters and locations from the show with relative ease. 

All the show's main characters are well represented in the polygon form, with poor Alyson Hannigan's Willow getting the worst job (her eyes are constantly closed with strange black eyelids, making her look like she is modeling for FIU's own "Got Tickets?" campaign).

Also a big plus in the realization of the show in game format is the involvement of most of the actor's providing their own character's voices instead of the tepid sound-alike you normally get stuck with. A Xander gag, Cordelia barb, Willow fidget, Giles fop or even Spike sneer wouldn't have quite the same resonance from a sound-alike. The clunker this time is not Willow, though, but David Boreanaz's reading of Angel. Apparently, he thought he could give a straight read and expect the programmers to put the "brood" in for him. They couldn't, of course, and every scene with Angel is completely void of any emotion or interest.

But the best part of the game is the actual play itself. Despite the best efforts of that uber-controller to make my life a living hell, "Buffy" is a joy to play in terms of how close to flawless the execution is. Swapping weapons is a breeze (when it's necessary) as is throwing vampires on wooden stakes on the floor. In fact, the "slayer" aspect of the game distinguishes it from the typical "Final Fight" brawler. You don't just beat up bad guys, you have to slay them, be it by cutting their head off or a stake through the heart. Should you fail do so, they'll keep coming despite their complete lack of energy. Of course, it's just as much fun to make them linger around just so you can try some of the countless attacks or combos on them until you kill them in precisely the way you want.

One last comment: Do not let Sarah Michelle Gellar's image on the cover of the box trick you though. She is completely absent from the game. Some sort of stupid contract stipulations did not allow the programmers access to her likeness or her voice. 

Thus, Buffy doesn't look exactly like Gellar and a sound-alike was hired instead. The sound-alike does such a spot-on job, it doesn't even matter that she wasn't involved. Amidst the rumors that this could be Gellar's (and thus, the show's) final season, her sound-alike only serves a sore reminder of how replaceable Gellar should have been.

Headline: FIU alumna gets big break in PBS film
Author: John Lovell
&nbsp;
For every successful actor or actress there is a defining genesis.  The first real gig.  It's a long, risky process which requires the most delicate patience as well as extreme dedication and ambition.  It takes years for some to land a solid role, while others never make the cut.  For FIU graduate Ana Maria Lagasca, her defining moment was on September 15 when "Almost a Woman," the story based on the second memoir of Puerto Rican writer Esmeralda Santiago, aired nationally on PBS as part of a Masterpiece Theatre collection.  

Lagasca premiered with the leading role, starring as young Esmeralda "Negi" Santiago.  "Almost a Woman" tells the first- hand account of Negi's immigration to the United States from Puerto Rico in the 1960s. Negi works hard to learn the English language and acquires it quickly and gracefully. 

However, she struggles to survive the hardships of having lost an adolescent identity amidst a foreign country.  Eventually, she finds help from a very motivational family of 10 and several encouraging teachers. The film ends with Negi's triumphant high school graduation and the satisfaction of having found her place in the world.

Having withstood the intimidation of her high school theater program, just as Negi did in the movie,  Ana Maria Lagasca earned her AA in just one year at Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida.  From there she received a full scholarship to FIU where she continued to pursue theater, devoting all her time to exceeding the requirement and taking as many classes as the department would allow.

In 1999, shortly after her graduation from the FIU Honors College with a BA in liberal arts and studies, Lagasca moved to Los Angeles to pursue her career in acting. She says, "Acting is something I've always wanted to do.  Nothing excites me more." 

Jokingly, she adds "I'm an only child! I love the attention!"  Lagasca feels a close affinity with the characters she sees on screen.  She is able to reach out and identify closely with the emotions being played in movies, a talent essential in the field of drama.  

In "Almost a Woman," Lagasca displays her precise and delicate ability to step into the persona of another character, just as her biggest influence and inspiration, Robin Williams, does with his vast array of multi chartered personalities.  

In the film, the essence of Negi's character is captured so elegantly, even her coarse accent is genuine.  Being from Puerto Rico herself, Lagasca felt like she understood exactly where this woman was coming from.  

To further prepare for the role, Lagasca read the book "Casi una mujer," written by Esmeralda Santiago, a sequel to her first memoir entitled "Cuando era Puerto Riquena," which she also read.  In addition, Lagasca was given the opportunity to meet Santiago.  She recounts on the real Negi being present during production. "I wasn't nervous around her at all.  She's a wonderful, tender and genuine person.  Just by looking over her, I could feel her story and where she was coming from."  At one point during production, someone on the set mistook them for twins when the two of them were stretching out when .

Ana Maria Lagasca has previously appeared in an episode of "The X- Files," yet "Almost a Woman" was her very first film work. "I had to hustle to find an agent," said Lagasca. "It's like a catch-22.  You can't work without an agent but can't get an agent without work."  

She was finally contacted by an agent who had received word of the opening for the part in the film, which was originally planned to be shot in New York.  A year later, after a very convincing audition, Lagasca was quickly signed to the role of Negi and the film was shot in Los Angeles.  Production for "Almost a Woman" consisted of about 20 days of hard work and was shot with a very tight budget.  "The work was hard but I did my part, trusted my instinct and it all went very well."

Lagasca owes a great deal of this start of her acting career to FIU.  The time she spent at FIU helped shape the actress she is today.  She gives credit to the entire theater department and its excellent staff of professors and instructors for all the strong motivation and encouragement they bestow on all of their students.

 She also recognizes the Honors College for all of its inspiration.  Her involvement and participation gave her the powerful dedication it takes to be an actress.  She applies so much from what she learned at FIU and wouldn't trade her experiences there for anything.

The horizon looks very promising for Ana Maria Lagasca. Recently, she teamed up with a new agent and they are currently looking at several different scripts and discussing the possibilities of future film work. Lagasca advises actors and actresses in-the-making to "never loose touch with who you are. Keep growing as an actor and trust your instincts.  Surround yourself with inspiration and strong motivation.  Don't ever give up or lose your determination." Her extraordinary personality and talent will take her career to great places.

Headline: Charming "Mostly Martha" stirs up romance
Author: Christina Kent
&nbsp;
Looking at the title of this year's "foodie film," "Mostly Martha" (German, French and Italian with English subtitles), you may ponder how it could possibly be about food rather than some egocentric woman. But don't judge a cookbook by its cover. This film is a brilliant combination of mouth-watering kitchen scenes and authentic character-defining moments.

Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck) is one of those feisty characters who seems to be better at cooking than she is at being happy. She lives to cook and has made a career as the uptight head chef of an elegant restaurant in Hamburg. When Martha isn't preparing entrées, she is explaining her blown-out-of-proportion problems to her therapist (August Zirner). The first half-hour of the movie is filled with fast-paced, vegetable-chopping scenes set to the tune of Italian jazz, which Sandra Nettlebeck, a great device director, uses to hook you into the atmosphere. 

Things begin to slow down and get emotional when Martha's sister dies in a car accident and Martha is forced to care for her eight-year-old niece, Lina (Maxime Foerste). This, of course, strains her usually dutiful work ethic. 

The conflicts in her life only get worse from this point: her boss Frida (Sibylle Canonica) hires a silly yet skilled Italian chef named Mario (Sergio Castellitto), whom Martha thinks is stealing her job away from her. Their disagreement over several dishes like gnocchi pasta, and Mario's insistence that he just wants to "learn from a great chef" makes for witty spats that only magnify the tension between them.

Lina, meanwhile, is proving to be a tough cookie and has scarcely eaten since her mother's death. When Martha brings her to the kitchen one night because the babysitter was negligent, Mario absently hands his bowl of pasta to her – finally getting her to eat. 

As Lina begins to share their addiction for good cuisine, the budding love between the two professional cooks becomes apparent.

One might imagine that a movie where food is the protagonist would be frustrating to watch, because you can't taste the cooking and the characters can very easily slip into clichés. However, this film puts uncertainties such as those to rest because it is truly endearing to watch this particular woman's life unfurl; we first see Martha as a neurotic, no-frills chef who then emerges as a cheery, pleasure-loving individual.

In short, if you've never tasted a "foodie" or even a foreign film, "Martha" would be a good way to start.

Headline: Miami Film Festival introduces new talent to showbiz
Author: Angela Castillo
&nbsp;
The Miami International Film Festival will be celebrating 20 years of great films this upcoming year. Recently named Festival Director Nicole Guillemet, who is the Former Sundance Institute Vice President, has promised to make the 2003 festival a major showcase for the exhibition of international film. 

Guillemet, who started working at her new position seven weeks ago, is delighted by the cultural diversity that Miami represents. 

"This festival here in Miami is a total challenge for me because the city offers a place to expand and to search for other outstanding work from the Hispanic world and Europe," she said.

Guillemet has announced a "talent hunting season" that will give novice filmmakers the opportunity to present their work and become acquainted with the business of film, thereby incorporating participation from the community. Her main goal is not only to encourage our community to attend the festival, but to offer them a wide range of work in the different cinema categories. She is looking for stories that touch the viewers and portray the beauty and passion for film.   

"When you see something, you have to be touched by something, and if that is applied to every form of artwork, it is just great. You can be angry, or you can be pleased, or you can laugh, and say: what is that piece of trash I've just seen?" Guillemet said. "In any way, it's bringing a reaction and therefore, it makes me think about something, and that's the beauty of film."

Films will be classified in six categories, three of which are competitive. The competitive categories include Feature, Documentary and Short films, all of which offer winners grand jury prizes and audience awards. All films must be submitted in English or subtitled in English. Films must have been completed no later than April 1, 2002. The submission deadlines are September 27th for short films, and October 4th for feature films. Those who qualify will be notified by mid –December for the 2003 Miami International Film Festival. 

The so-called melting pot community is going to be thrilled by the new taste of next year's festival. It is going to be a mixture of quality and variety for every viewer to enjoy. 

"I hope we will have a variety of interesting American and foreign movies. I think the new director is prepared to make the festival a truly international and respected film festival," Student Media Advisor Aldo Picini said. 

"I anticipate this coming year's festival to be amazing since the Miami Film Festival will be celebrating its 20th anniversary, and this should provide excitement among film enthusiasts throughout our community," TV Production Manager Diana Martinez said. "I believe any opportunity presented to a filmmaker to showcase his work should be taken, and what better way than during a festival such as the Miami Film Festival, which takes place in a city that is becoming very well-known in the film industry?"
