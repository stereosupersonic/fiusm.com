Headline: Miami to serve as hosts for March Madness in 2009
Author: Jaime Rodriguez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Michael Jordan, Dwayne Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Patrick Ewing, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. These are just some of the names that became legends on the basketball court and had their first bit of national exposure NCAA basketball tournament. 

For the first time in 15 years, the tournament will return to South Florida. The NCAA awarded FIU the right to host first and second round games in 2009, which will take place at the AmericanAirlines Arena.

Referred to as "March Madness" by basketball aficionados, the NCAA tournament is a month long basketball extravaganza in which 65 of the best college basketball teams in the nation duke it out in a single game elimination format, until a national champion is crowned.

Â The last time an NCAA tournament event was held in the region was 1994, when the University of Miami hosted the East Regional at the Miami Arena. That year Corliss Williamson and the Arkansas Razorbacks beat Duke Blue Devils to become National Champions.

Athletic Director Rick Mello and Associate Athletic Director Mike Garrity have been spearheading the project and he feels this is huge for the University. 

"This is huge, huge, huge for us, this helps us promote basketball to our community as well as getting our name into college basketball mix for years to come," Garrity said.

NBC 6 sports anchor Guy Rawlings mirrors the feelings about March Madness coming to Miami: "It's a big deal, the tournament grabs the attention of the nation in a way only the Super Bowl does. Everyone has their office pool and for one full month, the whole country is at the edge of their seat. This exposure for Miami as well as [for FIU] is excellent."

Memories have been made during March Madness, such as Michael Jordan's game winning shot for North Carolina in 1982, Dwayne Wade leading underdog Marquette to the 2003 Final Four or, just last year, Joakim Noah leading the Florida Gators to their first ever national title. So students are looking forward to seeing new memories in their own backyard.

"I'm very excited. Miami is becoming a basketball town because of the [Miami Heat's recent title] run," said senior Josh Santamaria. "And now having part of the tourney will only bolster the enthusiasm of the community."

The aura of South Florida sun, including the hotel options, accessibility to airports and first-rate venue in the American Airlines Arena, made Miami an appealing choice according to Jeanne Boyd, director of the NCAA men's basketball championship.

"We think it's going to be a really good site for our tournament,'' she said. "We're looking forward to building our relationship in Miami."

Headline: Linebacker does all his talking on the field
Author: Charlie Grau / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
For senior middle linebacker Keyonvis Bouie, he prefers to do all of his talking on the field and lets his game speak for itself.

His 118 tackles - 65 solo - from last season spoke loudly enough to earn him honors as preseason honorable mention All-American by Street & Smith's College Football 2006 Yearbook.

Bouie is the first Golden Panther to receive such an award and receive any type of Division I-A recognition. Last year, Collegefootballnews.com selected him as the Sun Belt Conference's Co-Defensive Player of the Year.  

"It's an amazing honor, especially coming from FIU," Bouie said.  

Like him, FIU's program is beginning to gain national attention after playing its first year in the Sun Belt Conference, but Bouie maintains that his focus is more on winning football games than winning a slew of individual accomplishments.

"I really don't like to get into stuff like that, I'm really about the team," he said.

Though he comes from Pahokee, Fla., a small town, there is nothing small about his game. All the attention and awards haven't changed him or swelled his ego.

"Ke Ke [Bouie], as far as I can say in one word is, humble. He's very humble," senior  linebacker Alexander Bostic III said.

Bouie's humbleness can often be mistaken for shyness, even though Bouie himself admits that he isn't as shy as he was when he was a freshman.

Most would be surprised to find him in his dorm on Friday night instead of at a party or club.

"I'm very quiet and I don't really get out much. I stay to myself a lot and stay in my room a lot," Bouie said. "And I'm very into my schooling."

Once he suits up and hits the field though, he's a little more vocal.

"When I'm out on the field I take over," he said. "I'm very loud and very aggressive and I tend to speak a lot louder than I would in a normal conversation. I tend to get people's attention when I'm on the field." 

Bouie, called Ke Ke (pronounced kee-kee) by his teammates, likes to lead by example rather than vocally. However fellow linebacker Bostic III begs to differ.

"We always get in to it because he says that he's the hardest worker and nobody works harder than him.  But I feel that same way, nobody works harder than me, so we're always competing [with one another]." 

Bouie hopes that his passion and work ethic will help transcend this season into a special one. Street and Smith's College Football 2006 Yearbook picked FIU to win the Sun Belt Conference this year and many on the team, along with Bouie, hope to make that prediction come true.

"This summer was a very positive summer, guys coming in with the right attitude working hard everyday and trying to get ready to step up to the plate and play this year. This team is going to surprise a lot of people."

The Golden Panthers will definitely have a chance to shock the world with a grueling out of conference schedule in which they will be considered heavy underdogs against teams such as Maryland, University of Miami, Bowling Green and Alabama. 

"Every game, you go out there with something to prove not just for yourself, but for us as a team. We have to prove to ourselves that we belong on this level," Bouie said. "We are a legitimate division one team and we're going to turn some heads this year." 

Going into a senior year, the thought of the NFL always creeps into many players' minds but Bouie maintains that his main goal is to receive his business degree.

"I'm always hopeful, but everybody's not going to play in the NFL. But that's one of my passions. I'm going to try my best to play in the NFL, but my degree is what's important to me right now. That was my goal when I got here and hopefully in December, that will be the biggest accomplishment for me."

Subheadline: Saudi reception a missed opportunity for debate
Author: Chris Nielsen / Junior / School of Hospitality Management
&nbsp;
Although I think it's quite a feather in the cap of FIU to play host to any foreign ambassador, I believe it was a missed opportunity to ask the Saudi Arabian ambassador some pointed questions about his country's history and current policies. 

Saudi Arabia is a country where public mutilation and public executions are a common sight in town squares; a country where women are denied the ability to travel, obtain employment, or get an education. Women are not allowed to vote, and at all times while in public, they must cover themselves with an abaya, a full-length garment that covers them completely from head to toe.

This is a country where gay men and women are subject to public flogging and beheading. On 9/11, countless citizens of Saudi Arabia were filmed dancing and celebrating the images of aircraft flying into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  This is the country that was home to fifteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers. 

If the opportunity ever presents itself for FIU to host President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran; Marshal Kim Jong Il of North Korea; or President Fidel Castro of Cuba (all countries with similar human rights records), let us hope that FIU's leaders will be a bit more reluctant before rolling out the red carpet.

Subheadline: Closing of Copy Center is wrong
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The decision by the University to close the privately owned and operated University Copy Center was, despite what FIU officials may tell you, an economically driven and greedy decision.

In a world where a university is as much a business as it is an educational institution, maximizing profits is the goal. Unfortunately, that bottom-line frame of mind has forced out an establishment that has loyally served the University community with all of its duplicating needs for the past 10 years.

The Beacon understands that these things happen everyday. As a capitalist society, it is a game of survival of the fittest. The administration under President Modesto A. Maidique, however, could not have been more disrespectful or cold in their decision to close the Copy Center. 

The Copy Center has not, as of yet, received an official reason for why they are being forced out, and a month after addressing a letter to Maidique himself, Copy Center General Manager Joanna Ervin still awaits a response. 

It seems as if the ousting of small businesses is becoming the norm at FIU. Just last Spring semester, Smoothie Time, one of the healthiest restaurants available for students to eat on campus, was shut down in order to make way for fast food giant Burger King.

Whether the new Duplicating Center - which will take over the location of the Copy Center in the Fall semester - ever makes a profit, remains to be seen. There are very little details on how the new Duplicating Center will be run and, perhaps more importantly, how it will be priced.

Who will be in charge of the new Duplicating Center also remains a mystery. We don't even know whether the new operators have retail experience. 

When The Beacon asked Marcos Perez, vice president of administration, whether Duplicating Center personnel has retail experience, he seemed at a loss for words, in which he told us that it was an "excellent question."

It is an excellent question indeed, Mr. Perez. It is a question which you should have the answer to - as it should have been answered months ago, not when the start of the Fall semester is near.

The Copy Center will close this week, ending their 10-year-run at the University. It is a shame that a small business that has dedicated a decade of work to FIU faculty and students was practically driven out. The owners of the Copy Center are people who have families to take care of, yet they are now left without a job to earn a living.

Headline: Israeli-Hezbollah conflict may escalate into region-wide war
Author: Roque Corona / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Tensions in the Middle East are rising rapidly as Israel intensifies its retaliatory air strikes on Lebanon. 

The attacks, which began on July 12 after Hezbollah militants killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others during a raid, have already left over 300 Lebanese civilians dead. 

Israel, though justified in its attacks on Lebanon, must ensure that its use of force is balanced, and that civilian casualties are left to a minimum. 

Peace in the Middle East is already hanging by a thread, and if Israel does not mind its actions carefully, they threaten to plunge the region into all-out war.

The scene in Lebanon is grim. Beirut and Haifa have been devastated by Israeli air strikes. 

Not surprisingly, Israelis have applauded the retaliatory strikes on the Lebanese infrastructure, which have killed more than 344 people, most of them civilians. The attacks were aimed at destroying the major headquarters of the Hezbollah and disabling their military capabilities. 

Hezbollah has managed to retaliate however, destroying major parts of Nazareth, Afula and Givat E'la near Israel's border with the West Bank. 

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said that the attacks on Lebanon will continue until Hezbollah releases the two Israeli soldiers it abducted. 

Israel has the right to retaliate for what Hezbollah has done, but not to the extent to which they have. Their continued attacks on civilian towns will only antagonize Hezbollah and most likely cause the conflict to spread to Syria and Iran, both of which support Hezbollah.

Iran, a major supporter of Hezbollah, has provided it with funding and military assistance. Al-Manar, a Hezbollah-run radio and television station, has reported that the Hezbollah attack on Israel used a Fajr-3 and a Ra'ad 1 missile, both developed and supplied by Iran. 

Furthermore, in accordance with the Iran-Syria Mutual Defense Pact, any attack on Syria would be considered an attack on Iran. Considering that Israel is already bombing dangerously close to the Syrian border, that makes for a dangerous situation.  

U.S. President George W. Bush has also expressed his stance toward the situation in Lebanon, stating that Syria must pressure Hezbollah to cease their attacks on Israel. 

Even more noteworthy is the fact that The Department of Defense has awarded Valero Energy Corp. a $36.8 million contract to supply Israel with military jet fuel. So, in practice, the United States is already materially supporting Israel in its campaign against Hezbollah.

If things escalate to the point where Syria, Iran, and Palestine feel the need to enter the war against Israel, the United States will very likely become involved. 

Regardless of what does occur, one thing is certain and that is that the Middle East is becoming ever more unstable, and right now Israel is the only one with the ability to alleviate some of its problems. Israel needs to show some measure of restraint or balance. 

Yes, Hezbollah is a dangerous and terrifying organization and its actions against Israel were terrible, but Israel must also realize that its own actions are tearing a larger hole in the fabric of Middle East relations. 

If those relations are further disrupted, the United States will have to contend with protecting their major ally in the Middle East, an act that would only lead to further instability.

Headline: Summer time brings fun to dorms
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. & Francesca Constantins / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Toward the end of every Spring semester, students who live on campus must make the decision of whether or not to stay on campus for the summer. 

Some believe that those who choose to stay during the summer are condemned to a summer of classes and nothing more.

 In actuality, the dorms are just as active during the summer as the normal year -  just on a smaller scale, according to Stephanie Garland, a resident assistant at Everglades Hall Lounge. 

"Our programs don't change much," Garland said. "We are doing at least five events even if our numbers our less." 

Some of this summer's events cater to sports fans. 

"When the finals were on [for Summer A] we had a Heat night for everyone to come and watch the Heat play," said Cedric Odom, a resident assistant for Bay Vista. "We did the same for the FIFA World Cup.  We do anything the residents will enjoy, as long as the budget allows it."

During the Fall and Spring semesters, events in housing range from educational to recreational.

"It's much more laid back." said Conference Assistant Yolanne Almanzar. 

Tiffany Simmons, a resident assistant at Bay Vista agreed and said that the dorms are relaxed during the summer.  

The halls are very quiet and not many people are roaming throughout the building, except those that are attending classes, according to Simmons.

"It's quiet, but it isn't the best impression for the freshmen starting during the summer," Simmons said. "It is quiet throughout the year but more things happen throughout the Fall [semester],"

Many of the freshmen get to experience the University before freshmen who come in in the Fall semester, and it gives them familiarity with the campus.

"The prospect of meeting new people and getting to know everybody, before the Fall [semester] rush is great," said Krystal Gonzalez. "By living on campus, I'll have accessible hours, and I won't be able to worry about traffic and getting to class on time." 

In the Fall and Spring, dorm room events are handled seperatly, but that changes during the Summer semester.

"Normally events are all planed and executed separately," said Ed Rodriguez, a resident assistant at Panther Hall. "But during the summer there is more unison. Rather than functioning as separate buildings we function as one." 

This year, the Resident Hall Association is planning a string of events in a new event called "Panthers Gone Wild" Week. 

Still in the planning stages, the event is going to have something for almost everyone, according to the concepts creator Lynn Guery, a resident assistant .

"We might have a game night in the new game room in the Graham Center," Guery said. "I know we're going to have a sports night." 

Guery said that students should expect their advertising campaign to begin soon.

Activities and events are not the only things going on in the dorms. 

During the summer, Gisela P. Vega, the assistant director of Residential Life is overseeing leadership training for incoming RHA officers. 

"There are multiple programs on leadership which are happening out of the Center for Leadership and Service program that all students can take advantage of," Vega said. 

RHA is also planning Welcome Week celebrations, which take place the first week of the Fall semester. 

Meetings  take place  Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in GC 314 and are open to all students.

So, whether it's training new staff, hosting Heat night or getting dorm room residents together to watch the World Cup, there is always something going on in housing. 

Unity is another factor that is always present in the Summer, and according to some resident assistants, everything is as fun as it would be during the Fall or Spring.

"It will bring the students together," Guery said.

Headline: Porter Davis Game Room re-opens
Author: Alejandra Serna / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For the past two years, the Graham Center at University Park has been undergoing a long-awaited remodeling process that is still in the works today. 

Part of this process included the relocation of several GC offices into the space occupied by the Porter Davis Game Room. 

The game room's doors closed in the summer of 2004 with the promise that they would one day re-open. 

On July 10, the game room officially opened for business.

"It's about time. It was hard to find something to do between classes, but we're all glad to have our place back," said junior Gilbert Torres, a long-time advocate of the game room. 

Torres had pulled support from Student Government Association and other student organizations in the Spring semester of 2005 to draft a petition urging officials to reinstate the popular hangout. 

Located in an intimate corner of the Rathskeller, the game room has plans to continue to offer students a place to relax and unwind during their spare time. 

It currently features an array of games and activities including billiards, table tennis, a wide selection of board games and many classic arcade games such as Street Fighter 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

The game room will be following in GC's footsteps by getting some renovations of its own. 

"We're happy to be able to give it a face lift for the Fall [semester]," said Ruth Hamilton, executive director of GC.

At the beginning of the summer, new paint, paneling and carpeting was added following the move of the offices housed for the last two years. 

"It gives the game room a more sophisticated feel and a better atmosphere," said Rene Sanchez, a junior and game room counter attendant of four years. 

The billiards area is next. Each table is being leveled and re-upholstered to ensure smoother games. 

Table tennis will be assigned its own area once the arcade section is consolidated and localized. 

The Fall semester will usher in a new online gaming area that will be established in the game room's current office space. 

"It's an attempt to keep up with our student body, since they're getting so high-tech now," Hamilton said. 

It will hold approximately eight computers and offer popular options, such as Counter-Strike and StarCraft. 

"This will save me the trouble of having to bring my Game Cube from home," said Adrian Valladares, junior and game room regular. 

This addition will be complemented by two flat-screen plasma TVs and a poker/domino section, which are said to be in the game room's future.

As improvements continue to be made, students can stay up to date on the status of the game room by visiting its websites online at guc.fiu.edu/gameroom and www.myspace.com/gcgameroom.

Headline: University to close Copy Center after 10 years
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. & Reuben Pereira / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
"It was the last thing that we thought would happen," said University Copy Center General Manager Joanna Ervin.

On July 28, the Copy Center at University Park will close its doors to students and faculty after 10 years of service.  The Biscayne Bay Campus Copy Center, also managed by Ervin, ended its service earlier this month.

Both lots are being replaced by the University-managed Duplicating Center, a center that only allows students to make copies. Currently, the Copy Center offered transparencies, binding and Fedex services.

The Copy Center's contract with the University was set to expire in September 2006. The Copy Center expected to receive an invitation to negotiate on a new contract by the end of April 2006.

The invitation never came, according to Copy Center business partner Joseph Bier.

 In a conversation with Director of Business Services Felecia Townsend, Ervin was informed that the invitation for negotiating a new contract had been retracted.

On May 19, Ervin spoke with Townsend about the new contract.

"I was surprised when Felecia told me the invitation to negotiate had been retracted and would not be forthcoming anytime in the immediate future."

Four days later, Ervin received notification from Townsend that the Duplicating Center would move into the Copy Center's current location and assume all retail operations.   

Ervin said the University has not given her an explanation for why her business was forced out.

On June 19, Ervin wrote a letter to President Modesto A. Maidique that explained the Copy Center's current situation. A month later, she is still waiting for a reply. 

However, the University is quick to stress that the center is not being closed; what's changing is who is going to be running it.

 "The services that are being provided in there now are expected to remain the same," said Marcos Perez, vice president for administration. "But instead of it being managed by an outside company, we're going to be managing with our own internal staff that's been working in the Duplicating area."

Townsend was unavailable for comment, despite repeated requests submitted to her office.

After the Copy Center's closure, the Duplicating Center will move into its new location and open time for the Fall semester.

"The reason for the timing is based on the student needs," Perez said. "Obviously, the summer time has a significantly lower volume for copying needs. If we had done it in the middle of September, it would have been in the middle of Fall and would have had a much greater impact on the students."

Ervin remains apathetic towards the University. 

"I cannot understand how FIU is so hypocritical with relation to my small business situation that is taking place on campus right now," She said. 

Perez disagreed. 

"Our responsibility is to the students and to run the business of the University as effectively and efficiently as possible," Perez said. "If we find an opportunity, then we can provide the same or better level of service to the students but in a way that actually allows us to reinvest those resources back into the University." 

He said the University's responsibility is to help meet its growing needs.

Perez also said that state funding has played a role in the decision-making process.

"Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly difficult to get funding from the state, so we have to become financially self-sufficient," Perez said. 

Duplicating Center employees do not have the retail experience to properly run a business based primarily on customer service, according to Ervin. Perez is unsure of how much retail experience Duplicating Center employees have. 

"I sincerely hope the folks coming in are trained for what they are going to be exposed to," Ervin said. "The first day of classes is indescribable."

Some students such as junior Sophia Del Zoppo are surprised at the center's sudden closing.

"I think it's wrong that FIU abruptly closed a small business that has been a part of the community for a decade," Del Zoppo said. "It's going to be very inconvenient for students and professors in the Fall."

Despite the end result, Ervin and Bier consider their 10-year history at the Copy Center an enjoyable experience, and they will miss life at FIU.

"It's like moving from a home you've lived in for many years," Ervin said.

Headline: Students, faculty speak out on crisis
Author: Betsy Martinez / News Director
&nbsp;
A crisis sparked in northern Israel with the abduction of two Israeli soldiers on July 12 has kept University students and faculty on edge. 

However, for FIU professor Russell Lucas, the problem dates back to the mid 1970s.

"If you listen to the media in the United States, this is about two soldiers who got kidnapped but you have to go back to the Lebanese Civil War," said Lucas, who will be teaching Middle Eastern Politics and Comparative Politics in the Fall semester.

The civil war began in 1975 and involved Israel, Syria and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.

In response to the July 12 kidnappings, Israel attacked Hezbollah's Beirut command center, hit Lebanese ports and blamed Iran with playing a part in an attack on one of its warships.

Senior Stefanie Abirached, a student whose family lives in Lebanon, was angered by the fighting.

"But after some thought, I realized that even though it puts all civilians in danger, this has to be done," Abirached said. 

Her aunts, uncles and cousins have had to leave their home in Beirut and seek refuge in their mountain home. 

Hezbollah guerrillas have has also fired hundreds of rockets into Israel. 

Guerrilla soldiers have fought back on the ground, wounding Israeli soldiers and destroying Israeli war tanks.

Rabbi Levi Friedman, from the Chabad Jewish Student Center at FIU, has family members in Israel whose neighborhood was bombed a few days after the battle began.

"People have to recognize that there are people who want the total annihilation of Israel," Friedman said. 

The latest reports from the region  confirm almost 400 casualties in Lebanon since the battle began. 

At least 36 Israelis have been killed, including 19 soldiers.

"[Hezbollah's weapons] are not comparable to the Israeli's weapons," Lucas said. 

The U.N. estimated that about a half-million people have been displaced in Lebanon, with 130,000 escaping to Syria and about 45,000 believed to be in need of assistance. 

The organization has also called for an immediate cessation of fire.

Almost two weeks later, the crisis in the Middle East between Israeli solders and Hezbollah militants continues.

"The current conflict is a continuation of things that have been going on before," Lucas said. 

Senior Veha Sngoun belives that world leaders need to come to an agreement.

"It seems that they're always fighting ... they're neighbors and they should be united," Sngoun said.

Now Abirached fears for her Lebanese family, and hopes "this ends as soon as possible so the country can go back to rebuilding what's been destroyed." 

Chabad has been holding prayers opened to all students in the Graham Center at University Park every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. 

They will also be holding prayers at the organization's center, located at 1266 S.W. 125 Ct., at 8:30 p.m.

Friedman said that one way students can cope with the crisis is by studying, praying and performing acts of goodness and kindness.

"Nobody likes war, and nobody likes killing regardless of their faith," Friedman said.

Headline: Shyamalan's bizarre fairy tale splits audiences
Author: Reuben Pereira / Assistant News Director
&nbsp;
Like all of his movies - barring The Sixth Sense - M. Night Shyamalan's latest film Lady in the Water will split audiences: those who'll despise the film for its unbelievable premise and those who'll enjoy it for its originality.

Like his last three films, Lady in the Water is well directed, but is plagued by inconsistent writing. However, unlike his other films, the film isn't a scare fest. Lady in the Water may scare you and thrill you, yet it is neither horror nor a thriller. 

The setting of the film is mostly relegated to one location - The Cove, an apartment complex that's superintended by Cleveland Heap (Paul Giamatti), a middle-aged man who seems to have given up on life, going about his business and dealing with residents and their problems on a daily basis. 

His life takes a turn one night when he falls into the community pool after investigating strange happenings occurring around the pool area. He wakes up in his room later that night with a strange young woman sitting next to him. The girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) tells him her name is Story and that she's a narf (more like a sea nymph) from the Blue World and her mission is to inspire a writer, whose work will change the world. 

Bringing conflict into this tale is the scrunt, a wolf-like beast whose sole purpose is to kill Story and prevent her from fulfilling her mission.

To say that the film marks a departure from Shyamalan's roster of films is an understatement. In his other films, his protagonists were seemingly ordinary looking people who had strange and extraordinary things happening to them. In this film, most of the characters are oddities themselves. 

There's Reggie (Freddie Rodriguez), a man who has been working out only one side of his body. There's a group of hippies who smoke and contemplate the meaning of life and there's Mr. Leeds (Bill Irvin), who sits around his television all day. There's Mr. Dury (Jeffrey Wright) who wracks his brain solving crossword puzzles all day and Harry Farber (Bob Balaban), a vicious film critic who criticizes the lack of originality in contemporary films. Add a psychotic Korean mother-daughter pair and a woman who takes in all sorts of animals and you have quite a freak show on your hands. 

As you'd expect, most of the laughs of the film come from this assortment of bizarre characters, some of whom would fit in comfortably into a fairy tale. And that's exactly what Shyamalan attempted with Lady in the Water. He creates his own fairy tale which takes place in our own, all too real war-ridden world.

With creature names like narf, scrunt and the tartutic and eccentric characters like the ones that reside at The Cove, it's hard not to roll your eyes or laugh out loud. However, with this film, it's necessary to suspend disbelief as one would with a fairy tale. In this cynical world that we live in, it's rare to find films that explore this sense of wonder and invoke a sense of childlike innocence. Watching the film, I was reminded of movies such as The Princess Bride and E.T., whose charm extended to more than just children. Lady in the Water is hardly half as good as E.T., but I could see what Shyamalan was aiming for and he deserves props for being imaginative.

The main flaws with the film lie in the fact that Shyamalan doesn't really know what he wants the film to be. He bills it as a fairy tale, but includes his trademark "edge of your seat" scares, with moving doors and sprinklers being his weapons of choice. 

Another thing that detracts the flow of the film is the director himself. Shyamalan is known for popping up in his movies in cameos, but this time around, he gives himself a much larger role - the second male lead! It is also the role of the writer whose work will save the world. It just screams of self-indulgence and a bloated ego.

Performances in the film range from fantastic to mediocre, with Giamatti being phenomenal, as usual. Howard doesn't have to do much, but what she has to do, she does convincingly. Bob Balaban, as the film critic, steals scenes as he pokes fun at characters and even the film itself; it is a delight to watch. Shyamalan isn't too bad in his role either but should stick to directing. The rest of the actors are barely register.

End Note: Lady in the Water may not be Shyamalan's best work nor his worst (that would be The Village), but it offers a sweet tale with a message that everyone serves a purpose in life. While this movie won't make you believe in magic or fairy tales, it's something new and original in a summer filled with pirates, superheros, spies and snakes on a plane.

&nbsp;
The most intriguing of culinary locales always seem to conspicuously lie in the most unassuming locations. Jerusalem Market & Deli is no exception. Resting on the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and Miami Beach Boulevard, this market and deli serves loyal patrons authentic Middle Eastern fare.  

This casual establishment, adorned with colorful hookahs (all for sale), allows customers to try a variety of appetizers, all unique to the Middle Eastern region. Whether it tops a pita or is wrapped in grape leaves, Jerusalem Market & Deli has it. 

One of the "must haves" is their homemade hummus. Whether you purchase one of their many pita varieties or simply use what you have at home to dip, this hummus carries with in an undeniably authentic and homemade taste that only fresh chickpeas can offer.

If you are unfamiliar with Middle Eastern cuisine, the best choice is to be open and try the foods that look tasty or simply ask for suggestions. The friendly staff (usually led by the owner) will always explain what each dish comprises of.  This is how I arrived at their Lebanese pizzas, a large pita topped with ground beef, rich and flavorful spices and vegetables, all baked, just like a pizza but with a Middle Eastern kick.

At Jerusalem Market & Deli you will always see something wrapped in grape leaves. Rolled into the leaves is rice and meat smothered in spices that bear the flavor of traditional Middle Eastern fare. 

For those who prefer vegetarian choices, dishes with no meat are also available with the same distinctive flavors. It's almost impossible to leave this deli without having some falafel.  Falafel, fried balls of chickpeas or fava beans, make a great side dish or take-home snack.

 An array of curries is generally always available with ingredients ranging from beef and potatoes to other tubers and gourds.  One of these curries drenched over rice makes a promising meal.

A dining establishment that is also a market allows the patron to bring home the flavors they just experienced and try them out in their own home. Jerusalem Market & Deli offers a variety of grocery items from the Middle East. 

An entire section is dedicated to an assortment of olives, both black and green. Packages of pita bread are stacked high in front of a case that offers unique cheeses, fresh olives, savory teas and other Middle Eastern delicacies.  

Browsing the shelves is always interesting because one never knows what they might find. Jerusalem  Market & Deli carries small bags of dried hibiscus flowers imported from the Middle East. 

At a lower cost than a more expensive organic market would charge, these dried buds - when steeped in hot water with a bit of honey - make a smooth, sweet and soothing tea with a distinct aroma and rosy hue.

The owner of Jerusalem Market & Deli is nearly always there, managing his establishment day in and day out. 

Jerusalem's Market & Deli food selection is very personal and varied; every time there seems to be something new in his food case to try. At affordable prices, Jerusalem Market & Deli is a remedy for the everyday food blues.

Headline: Shakespeare adaptation presented by theater students
Author: Maria Chercoles / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU Theater will be presenting Shakespeare's love comedy "A Midsummer Night's Dream" from July 27 through August 6. Associate Professor of Theater Philip M. Church - who teaches theater at different levels and has directed previous University productions such as "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cabaret" - is directing the play.

Unlike previous plays produced by the FIU Theater, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was produced as an independent project between Church and the students. 

With the help of sponsors such as the University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Associations and the Skanska construction group, the production was able to raise $6,300. Dean of Arts and Sciences Mark Szchuman also donated $1,000 for the project. 

The production is very important for the FIU Theater Department and students because it is being entered into the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, competing against many top theater schools throughout the nation. 

"This was a great opportunity for some of us students who are freshman and have no acting experience," said freshman Ashley Polo, who plays Snugita, one of the actors in the construction worker's scene. "We basically gave our summer away to this project." 

The plot evolves around two pairs of beleaguered lovers who confuse their identities while they struggle against nature forces. 

Viewers can expect to be surprised by Church's modern adaptation of the classic, which respects characters and screenplay, but include Church's personal touch based on today's social and environmental problems. 

"Production originated from reading Titania's monologue 'These are the forgeries of jealousy,'" Church said. "Titania is berating the fact that their struggle over the custody of the Indian changling boy is resulting in so much destruction happening on the earth below. I thought that Shakespeare was just saying what we are telling ourselves today: that we are the cause of global warming and the extreme changes in climate." 

The adaptation not only centers on environmental changes, but characters are given more thought. For example, the plays original troupe of forest actors are instead represented by a group of construction workers.

"Philip's adaptation gives more importance to actual problems like the forces of nature, especially hurricanes," said freshman Lali Watts, who plays a wind spirit. "The play centers in how elements react depending on human behavior. Nature changes as human emotions do. "

However, this is not the first time Professor Church, who has a class in Shakespeare Acting, adapts a play from the great English playwright; last year, he did a modern adaptation of "Romeo and Juliet." 

"When working with Church, the first thing to consider is his knowledge and how important Shakespeare is for him," said junior Jade Goodridge, who plays Francis Flute, a female construction worker. "He expects the best of you.   Something he always tells us is 'Shakespeare demands that your characters command.'" 

"A Midsummer Night's Dream" will be showing from July 27-30 at the Roxy Performing Arts Center at 1645 SW 107 Ave. (across from University Park). Tickets are $12.00 for General Admission and $10.00 for FIU Students. The play will also be performed August 3-6 at the BBC Mary Ann Wolfe Theater Thursday - Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets are $10 for general admission and $8 for FIU students. For tickets and more information call (305) 348-3358.

Headline: The Student Hookup
Subheadline: PantherCard provides students with valuable, local discounts
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Assistant Life! Editor
&nbsp;
As a student, you have to buy expensive textbooks, deal with sparse parking options and even attend class. There's one important advantage though: student discounts. Because of your status as a hard-working, University-attending individual, a lot of vendors offer special discounts to attract the college demographic. 

No matter where you go or what you buy, always make sure to ask for a student discount because you may be surprised by who offers them and how much money you can save. 

Whether you're hungry or looking for affordable (or just plain cheap) admission prices, here are some discounts to take advantage of during your four (or more) years at the University.



Food



This summer term, dining options are virtually nonexistent at University Park. Subway, Fresh Food Company, PantherStop and the Green Library's Java City are your only on-campus choices for eating meals. Instead of munching on the same food every day between classes, nearby restaurants such as Moe's Southwest Grill, a Mexican eatery, are letting students save some money when dining off-campus. 

Moe's, located at 10660 NW 19th St. in Doral, is currently offering a 10% discount on your meal whenever you show your PantherCard to the cashier. The discount applies to any menu item.

"We offer the 10% discount because the campus is nearby," said Manager Edward Redick. "Our location attracts a lot of FIU students for lunch, and some of our employees actually attend FIU."

Also, the Subway at 2050 NW 107th Ave. provides FIU students with a 10% discount on any purchase. 

"The discount is solely for FIU students," said Subway employee Julio Valdes.

For students needing hot coffee and tasty donuts prior to a grueling day of classes, the Dunkin' Donuts at 10754 SW 24th St. saves you some money with a 10% discount off your purchase. 



Attractions



Aside from showing your PantherCard at local dining venues, you can also use it for discounts at local attractions such as movie theaters and museums.

Most local movie theaters provide a student discount for tickets bought after 6 p.m. At the Cobb Theatres in Dolphin Mall, using your PantherCard will let you purchase a $9 ticket for $7. Such savings can be useful when purchasing an overpriced bag of popcorn or candy.

"I use my student ID whenever I go to the movies late at night," said sophomore Gabriel Rodriguez. "I use the money I save towards the concessions, which can be pretty expensive."

Artistically inclined students can browse through the different art collections at museums such as the Wolfsonian-FIU at 1001 Washington Ave. in Miami Beach and the Miami Art Museum on 101 West Flagler St. for free with proper identification. Non-students will end up paying $7 and $5, respectively.

Another attraction with student-specific pricing is the Coconut Grove Playhouse, which lets students buy tickets a half hour prior to a show for $15, a savings of more than 50% for some shows. 

Also, the Miami Museum of Science and Planetarium gives students a $2 discount off ticket prices, which includes admission to Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition, which shows the design of the ship as well as the chronological history of its maiden voyage and sinking. 

For more information on student discounts at cultural attractions, visit CultureShockMiami.com.



Online Vendors



Student discounts are available for anything from computer software to airfares through various online vendors.

JourneyEd.com, a website specializing in selling discounted computer software and accessories, helps students save money when purchasing computer programs such as Adobe Creative Suite and equipment like MP3 players. Adobe Creative Suite, retailing for more than $900 in stores, can be purchased for significantly less: $389.98. 

"I heard about JourneyEd.com when I was in high school, and I use it all the time," said freshman Carlos Ramirez. "It saves me a lot of money when I want certain programs for class."

StudentUniverse.com offers discounted travel rates to students and faculty. Once your student status is verified, you are free to browse the different prices available for traveling within the U.S. and outside of the U.S. 

Whether you want to plan a trip to Las Vegas or Paris, the website lets you book flights, hotels and hostels as well as rail service in Europe.
