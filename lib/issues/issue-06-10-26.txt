Headline: National media's post-brawl reaction is too 'gangsta'
Author: Charlie Grau / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
I have often questioned why journalists aren't held in higher regards, but after witnessing how the national media handled the reaction to the brawl, I can understand people's gripe.

ESPN and sports writers from across the country have been slamming the University of Miami while handing FIU a pass - even though FIU players threw the first punches-for the chaos that took place Oct. 14 at the Orange Bowl. On ESPN's  "Around the Horn", columnists from around the country weigh in on different subjects, often making knee-jerk remarks to make the show more interesting. No facts, just dumb ranting and raving to see who can make the loudest noise.

Among the dumb comments made on the show were by Chicago Sun-Times columnist Jay Mariotti, who called for UM to suspend the rest of the season. Others took it a step further. Former Denver Post columnist Woody Paige believes that UM should suspend its football program for several years.

I'm sure these 'experts' probably only saw the 30 second clip that ESPN has shown over and over.

Although nobody has called for FIU to suspend its season or football program, many of its players have been targeted as thugs - an image UM has had trouble trying to remove since the 1980s.

It's sad to say, but when the country thinks of FIU, the first things that comes to mind are images from the fight and the opinions that sports writers have been force-feeding the public.

Charmaine DeFrancesco, an associate professor and sports performance consultant at FIU who was present at the game, doesn't think the public is getting all the facts. DeFrancesco has worked with professional athletes and understands the scrutiny that they experience.

"UM [may have] the reputation of being thugs; well the media is the one who pronounces it and illustrates it. Mainstream America doesn't bother to do their research," DeFrancesco said. "If you want to look at physical stuff, take a look at hockey, take a look at rugby. You can't throw the race card at those sports."

And that card has been thrown around the past few days. 

The day of the UM and FIU fight, Holy Cross and Dartmouth got into a scuffle after Holy Cross players celebrated an overtime victory by jumping on Dartmouth's midfield logo.

Coincidentally, there was no video of the fight, no ESPN highlights of it and almost no mention of it in national media.

Most people are still unaware of it.

It's an unfair double standard.

In hockey, a day doesn't pass where players don't duke it out. So they're all thugs, right?

I don't recall Pedro Martinez being called a thug after he threw Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer - 72-years-old at the time-to the ground during the 2003 ACLS.

"I think people are uneducated and one bad apple doesn't spoil a whole bunch. But in sports unfortunately you do something in the lime light and you're going to get that reputation," DeFrancesco said. 

"There were black guys, white guys and yellow guys all on that pile. And that's the way it was. If there were polka-dotted guys, I'm sure they would be on the pile, too. It had nothing to do with race, it had to do with the situational environment."

Though both universities have yet to announce if they will proceed with the Oct. 6 rematch next year, it would be in their best interest if they did. 

School officials are afraid of another fight, but what would that say about both universities, as well as their coaches, if they couldn't give it another try?

There is no other way for UM to pack the Orange Bowl with that many fans if some other small team like Arkansas State plays them. The hometown rivalry will do more good than bad for the community.

"If the presidents can't control their coaches and the coaches can't control their athletes, then there really isn't any place for sports in high education," DeFrancesco said. "This could have been a really great series, the start of something really great."

Just don't let the columnist from Around the Horn make that decision.

Headline: Men's soccer suffers another late game break down
Author: Andrew Kameka / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Forgive the men's soccer team if players aren't fans of the number 102. Kentucky forward Ryan O'Neil scored a game-winning goal in the 102nd minute, handing FIU its second loss of the season to come at that point in the match.

FIU (6-7-1, 2-4 Conference-USA) suffered an identical fate against Southern Methodist, and the 2-1 loss to Kentucky (10-4-2, 3-2-1) is a bit too familiar for a team that has lost four hard-fought games to late goals.

"I've never seen such a string of bad luck in my life," said head coach Karl Kremser. "We've played plenty of teams tough and lost late. We've got a great group of kids and a good team, but sometimes you need a bit of luck. Unfortunately for us, the only luck we've had this year has been bad."

O'Neil added to the Golden Panthers's misfortune with a cracking header early in double overtime. Senior midfielder Nathan Li floated a cleared ball back into the box, which found O'Neil near the right post. The 6'2" forward jumped to head the ball past goalkeeper Kyle Thomas and give Kentucky the win.

The Wildcats made the first cut with a Michael D'Agostino goal in the 17th minute. After controlling a long goal kick from keeper Matt Troop, D'Agostino dribbled down the left flank and fired an 18-yard shot that bested Thomas. The ball zipped into the top of the right goal post to give Kentucky a 1-0 lead.

"It was difficult to play them because they make no qualms about sending the ball long," Kremser said. "It was a helter skelter match, which is the [toughest] kind of soccer imaginable. We had chances to win, too, but the ball doesn't always bounce your way."

Sophomore midfielder Óli Birgisson gave FIU new life in the 35th minute and scored the first goal of his collegiate career. Birgisson got open eight yards in front of the goal and knocked in a headed pass from senior forward David Hope to knot the score at 1-1.

But FIU couldn't find the net and ended the match with a total of eight shots. The defense almost maintained the stalemate and withstood a barrage of 18 shots, most of which went wide or were blocked, before O'Neil scored. 

Kentucky's victory stunned several FIU players, who stood in disbelief after the late goal. FIU also surrendered late game-winners to then No. 18 Illinois-Chicago and No. 9 South Carolina. 

Kremser said that after losing yet another hard-fought game, team morale has taken a hit. 

"It breaks their spirit," Kremser said. "The team was really, really down after that game because there's such finality. You don't even get a chance to tie it up cause it's sudden death, which is really a shame."

The men's soccer team isn't ready to hit the panic button, but time is ticking on its season. With only two games remaining in the season and a C-USA Tournament berth up for grabs, FIU is focused on its games against Central Florida and Alabama-Birmingham.

"I think we can win them both, but then again, you never know. Those games are going to be supercritical," Kremser said.

Here's a scouting report for each game, including the regular-season finale that could very well determine if the postseason is in the Golden Panthers's future.

Oct. 25 at Central Florida:

Much like FIU, UCF has dropped a few close games recently. The Golden Knights have lost 2-1 to South Carolina and Kentucky, and will look to end the skid when they host their rivals from Miami. Sophomore forward Zak Boggs is the biggest offensive threat, so FIU will have to neutralize the team-leading scorer if they hope to earn a victory.

Oct. 28 vs. UAB:

C-USA positioning will be at stake for both teams, so this could possibly be the most important game of the season. UAB upset Kentucky and nearly repeated the feat against Tulsa, so FIU can expect a tough match. The Blazers have plenty of speed, especially with C-USA leading-scorer Jerson Monteiro. The Golden Panthers will have to match that if they plan to outpace UAB in the conference race.

Headline: Volleyball peaking at the right time
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Following two dismal performances away from home against conference power houses Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee, Golden Panther women's volleyball head coach Danijela Tomic pleaded with her team to raise the level of intensity.

Riding the back of explosive outside hitter freshman Yarimar Rosa, the Golden Panthers answered their coach's call by picking up two impressive wins in their final road games of the season.

After a strong showing in a 3-1 (27-30, 30-27, 30-25, 34-32) win over Arkansas State University's Lady Indians Oct. 20, the Golden Panthers drubbed the University of Arkansas Little Rock 3-0 (30-22, 30-18, 33-31) Oct. 22 to improve to 10-2 in Sun Belt Conference play.

Tomic says she believes the speech she gave after the let down on the road may have ignited the budding team.

"I told them it wasn't the end of the world and we loss to one of top teams and all we had to do was go out and play hard," Tomic said. "I told them the best way to bounce back and feel good about yourself is to win. I challenged them to win those two matches and they went out and did it."



FIU 3, ASU 1



With 12 consecutive wins to their credit, the Lady Indians entered the contest against the Golden Panthers eager to keep up their winning ways. However, Rosa and the hungry Golden Panthers had other plans. In what was her 12th 20 plus kill performance of the season, Rosa continued her offensive assault as she led the Golden Panthers with 21 kills and eight digs. Freshman power hitter Olga Vergun continued to flourish with 19 kills at a .309 clip, and junior setter Keila Oliveria came through nine digs, four kills, and three blocks to complement her match high 65 assists. Junior Anita Szymanska added 11 kills on .450 hitting, Andra Rasby had a career high 18 digs and consistent contributor Arasay Guerra chipped in with 13 kills. 

Senior Randilyne Volker was on fire offensively for the Lady Indians with 22 kills at a .381 clip, while Robin Aaron and Jessalyn Payne added 15 and 13 kills respectively.



FIU 3, UALR 0



Following that win, the Golden Panthers were even more dominant in their next game against Arkansas Little Rock. With a match high 47 assists, and 10 digs, Oliveria orchestrated a masterful attack by directing the Golden Panthers to a season high .404 clip for the game. Rosa and Vergun continued to lead the squad with 18 and 15 kills respectively, Guerra added 11 kills and four aces, and Rasby had another strong game with 15 digs.

Amila Barakovic was a force offensively for Arkansas Little Rock with 20 kills and nine digs, and Sandra Dzile delivered a 33 assist, three ace performances in a losing effort.

The Golden Panthers will look to wrap up the regular season strong, with all five of their remaining regular season games at home. They will look to avenge their lone two losses in conference play against division leading Western Kentucky Oct. 27 and third placed Middle Tennessee Oct. 29.

"We are the only team in the east division that beat every team in the west division," Tomic said. "We have played our best volleyball at home and we will be ready this time around because we didn't play up to our potential. It will be a challenge but if we play up to our potential it is hard to beat us."

Headline: Golden Panthers not making the grade
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's been a long year for coach Don Strock and his staff: a new offensive line that has had to learn the ropes; a quarterback that has struggled to find protection to make the right decision; and a running game that has been anything but decent. 

The defense has been the only bright part of the season so far and, with two of its starting members dismissed from the team, it's hard to think that things will get any better. 

Quarterback: D+ 

For Josh Padrick, his senior season has been all but what he expected. Following a 2005 campaign that saw him complete 221 passes on 366 attempts for 2461 yards, 13 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, his final season looked to be his breakout year. He was named one of the best in the conference and though everyone knew that he had a new group in front of him and some new receivers, it all looked to be going his way.

So far, however, Padrick has struggled to make good decisions while rolling out of the pocket and making poor throws inside the pocket.

One of the main reasons for his struggles can be attributed to the new offensive line that was put in front of him and their adaptation to the speed of the college game.

Another could be his overdependence on seniors Chandler Williams and Cory McKinney to make catches, overlooking freshman receivers early on in the season in crucial situations, and forcing the ball into double or triple coverage.

His game has become predictable and the defenses have taken advantage.

So far, the season numbers are as follows: 129 completions on 229 attempts for 1247 yards, three touchdowns and 10 miserable interceptions. Thus the grade can be no higher than a D+. 

Running Backs: D

Like the quarterback position, the running game has really struggled because of a lack of nice holes. The sophomore tandem of Julian Reams and A'mod Ned has seen their list of tough defenses, but clutch turnovers in key moments have really changed the outcome in games. 

Ned was sidelined halfway through the loss to Arkansas State with a knee injury and Reams has carried the load since against North Texas and Miami. His combined yardage thus far: 282 yards on 81 carries. Prior to the injury Ned was averaging 55.2 yards per game and showed his speed on an 80-yard run against Bowling Green. However, their lack of production, regardless of the reasons, has led this offense to stutter and thus lose close football games. Because of that, their grade can't be any higher than a D. 


Wide Receivers/Tight ends: C 

Because of the struggles that Padrick has faced, this receiving core's numbers are slightly lower then what they could have been. Having said that, before the suspensions following the brawl, Williams was second in the Sun Belt in receptions - 6.14 - and has managed 62.4 yards per game. McKinney's numbers are also fantastic, with an unbelievable 89-yard touchdown reception at Maryland highlighting his season. 

However, this core has been susceptible at times, mostly because of their youth and mental mistakes in certain situations (the dropped passes late and in overtime against North Texas standout).

With freshman Ashyln Parker, John Houston Whiddon and Jeremy Dickens stepping up their play as of late, and the numerous opportunities they are going to have with Williams and McKinney suspended, look for this core to be better as games go by late in the season.  Their grade, so far, is a C.


Defensive line: B

If there is one thing that can be counted on in every game from this team is their solid defensive performance. As of the bi-week following the Miami game, the defense ranks 27 in the country in total defense - 289.71 ypg - and 18 in pass defense - 159.29 ypg.

They have forced 12 turnovers, which can be attributed to the pressure put on the opposition by this group of men. Led by senior Antwan Barnes, with a team leading 13 tackles for loss and who kicked off the season with a four-sack game against Middle Tennessee, this group has sacked the opposing signal caller 17 times. 

Though they have been tired due to lack of offensive support, they have held strong and have, most importantly, kept this team in games they should have not even been close in the way the offense was performing. Their grade is a B only because of some costly personal foul penalties in precious moments.


Linebackers: B+

The linebacking core, led by pre-season Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year Keyonvis Bouie, has lived up to what was expected coming in. 

The same that was said for the D-line can be repeated for them. They are quick, they are strong and have great on-field leadership, thanks to Alexander Bostic III. Bouie leads the way with 70 tackles on the year; Bostic ranks third with 43. The two have also combined for 24 tackles for a loss and seven of the team's 17 sacks.


Secondary: B 

If there is one group that has stepped up beyond what was expected of them coming in it has been this group. 

The losses of Chris Smith (62 total tackles and four breakups) and Marshall McDuffie (19 tackles and a fumble recovery) will hurt them severely, but one cannot forget what others have done.

 Lionell Singleton has been a one man wrecking crew with interceptions in the first five games of the season. Along with Robert Mitchell's two interceptions at corner, the two have shown that they can shut down opposing receivers but the suspensions and dismissals will hurt them as much as the receiving core. It's now time for the young guys to step up and show that they to can perform at this level.


Special teams: D 

The offense has struggled to put points up on the board and so that has given the special teams a chance to see some playing time. 

The kicking game was a nightmare early on, with two missed extra points costing the team two wins. Dustin Rivest has since become their man and though he too has struggled at times, it seems as though this team is confident in their kicker. Rivest's numbers this season: four of nine with a long of 37. One must remember that, like their punter Chris Cook (averaging 35.6 yards per punt), they are both freshmen and there is always a learning curve as these players switch levels. 

The return game has also been suspect at times, but since the move of Singleton to return man it has really taken off. He returned a crucial kickoff for a touchdown against Bowling Green and coupled with the punt return for a touchdown by Williams, they have done their fair share. The only asterisk in their record has to be the mistake by freshman Whiddon against MTSU in the opener that cost them a chance to win and the fumble by Williams against Arkansas State that really put that game away. Overall, the kickers get a D because of their negative impact in changing the outcomes of games. With that grade easily rising as time passes, the returners score a B-.


Coaches: F 

As far as the coaching staff is concerned, are there any positives in a 0-7 start? This team has consistently made the same mistakes and shows no signs of change. 

Clock management has been horrible, especially late in the Maryland game, and too many excuses are being made about this team's struggles because of the youth of their program. When you lose five games by a combined 14 points, it comes down to coaching. The loss of control of the team that led to the brawl against Miami is just icing on the cake. Their grade is unquestioned - an F.

Headline: Editorial: Proposed schedule may trouble students
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The Faculty Senate convened Oct. 24 to debate schedule changes to FIU classes. The approved schedule, which has yet to be adopted by the University, would alter classes from a Monday and Wednesday schedule to a new Monday, Wednesday and Friday schedule. 

The schedule approved by the Faculty Senate would limit classes between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. from the approximate 75-minute blocks to 50-minute blocks. Night classes would not be affected, but the schedule would push many daytime classes to meet three times a week rather than twice.

The issue originated from the University's endless expansion and need for funds. As FIU continues to grow without an end in sight, University officials are pushing for more funding from the government. One idea that would help FIU receive more money is to increase its use of classroom space. By using class space more efficiently, FIU hopes to earn more funds from the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. This would mean having more classes on Fridays, when the campus is usually empty.

While this may appeal to the University's thirst for money, it does not seem to have the students' lifestyles in mind. The average FIU student is 27-years-old. The average FIU student is likely to be married, have kids, have a full-time job and have to battle through Miami traffic to get to class. Taking time off from the chaos of the everyday may be worth it for a few classes taken twice a week, but who wants to drive through rush hour, scour for parking and hike across campus three times a week for a class that lasts just long enough to catch your breath?

The fact of the matter is that FIU's current schedule is just fine. Do new facilities and renovated classrooms sound good? Without a doubt, yes. But what the Faculty Senate hasn't realized is how students incorporate their education into an already busy lifestyle.

Proponents of the new schedule argue that the funds will give FIU the necessary means to renovate classrooms, build campus-wide Internet access and create a simpler University class schedule. However, what good will all of that technology do when the teacher doesn't have any time to teach? What's the point of making a cleaner schedule when the class length isn't worth your effort to attend?

In addition, many students should be concerned about the schedule's effects on testing. Students taking daytime classes will be forced to take their exams in 50 minutes, while nighttime students will have an extra 25 minutes.

If you work on Fridays, you better give your boss the bad news. Ironically, this new class schedule would severely handicap a students' ability to pay for their own education by removing a day that may be used to work.

If such a desperate measure needs to be taken to increase funding, the Faculty Senate should better understand the serious inconvenience that this new schedule will cause. If students sit by and let this decision go unchallenged, we may all be regretting it next year - 50 minutes at a time.

Headline: Testy Intentions: Nuclear ambitions stand in the way of effective diplomacy
Subheadline: CHRIS ON CHRIS: A POLITICAL DEBATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
Author: Christopher Necuze / Managing Editor
&nbsp;
~ On the Right ~

North Korea's luck just ran out. 

In one of the few times in its history, the United Nations was able to act swiftly in response to North Korea's unprecedented testing of a nuclear device.

U.N. Resolution 1718 was unanimously passed by the Security Council, imposing long overdue sanctions on a nation that has totally disregarded anything the international community had to say against its development and testing of a nuclear weapon. The resolution, though a step in the right direction, only highlights the extreme circumstances that it takes to get the U.N. to actually do something productive.

Democrats hail President Clinton's 1994 Agreed Framework as the solution to the problem, proclaiming with raised fists that the Bush administration screwed everything up as usual when they pulled out of the agreement. However, it was the gullible Democrats who really dropped this potato. 

The United States only pulled out of this agreement after it discovered that the North was secretly enriching uranium, an act that was in clear violation of the 1994 Agreed Framework. Close, Bill, but no cigar.  

Four years later, they are testing a nuclear device. The size of the actual test, though still under investigation, is estimated to be less than 1 kiloton. Upon first receiving news of the explosion, most international bodies were not even sure it was actually a nuclear explosion. The blast was later confirmed of being nuclear in nature when the U.S. Geological Survey found radioactive isotopes in the air.

Though an embarrassment as far as nuclear explosions go, North Korea's test was a nuclear test nonetheless, and should be treated as such. Although you don't have to worry about a Taepodong-2 missile landing in your backyard anytime soon - North Korea uses 1940s missile technology incapable of even successfully reaching its destination, let alone deliver a warhead - the notion that Kim Jong-Il wants to put one there should be frightening enough.

The intentions of the rogue nation are a greater concern than its actual military capabilities. The fact that North Korea is seeking to increase its military capabilities specifically to engage the United States and its allies in war is particularly troubling. It poses a threat not just to national security, but even more so to international security.

Sanctions should only be the beginning. Though it is unfortunate that the citizens of the reclusive nation must pay for the actions of their government, social unrest may be the ultimate leverage in getting the North to cooperate. 

As a global leader and a member of the international community, the United States must make sure that the menace of North Korea is not allowed to intimidate and bully other countries with threats of war - especially nuclear war. 

Diplomacy is the key, but it has to be the kind of diplomacy that is unafraid to stand up and show that the civilized world will not tolerate this type of behavior. For diplomacy to even stand a chance, we have to stop North Korea now.

Headline: Testy Intentions: Bush administration fails at compromise with North Korea
Subheadline: CHRIS ON CHRIS: A POLITICAL DEBATE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
Author: Christopher Cabral / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
~ On the Left ~

In 1994, North Korea was months away from building an atomic bomb and had publicly pulled out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They expelled United Nations weapons inspectors and made clear their nuclear intentions. President Clinton demanded that the United Nations impose sanctions - sanctions which the North Koreans claimed would mean war. To prepare for such a scenario, plans were drawn up for a possible invasion.

Today, we don't talk of the North Korean War of 1994. Such a disaster was averted because the United States was willing to negotiate.

In a deal brokered by Jimmy Carter during the Clinton administration, the North Koreans agreed to permanently lock up their radioactive fuel rods, let inspectors back in and give up their weapons program. In exchange, the United States would normalize relations with North Korea, give them nominal aid and promise not to invade. It wasn't an ideal agreement, but it worked. North Korea locked up its fuel rods and international inspectors confirmed that the nation had ceased its nuclear program.

Once Bush took office, however, he decided to take a different approach. The United States would make no compromises with North Korea. Bush decided to pull out of the agreement, label the country as part of an axis of evil and cease one-on-one negotiations with them.

North Korea decided to unlock its fuel rods and start building a nuclear weapon. The regime stated repeatedly that they would stop their weapons program if the United States pledged not to invade them. Bush, refusing to compromise, said no. North Korea offered to halt the program if the United States re-established the old agreement. Bush said no. Time and time again, the Bush administration demanded that North Korea comply with its demands - not because North Korea had anything to gain from cooperating, but simply because Bush said so. 

Our leaders need to know how to compromise when dealing with the international community. Due to our current president's incapacity to do that, we're now in a difficult situation with few appealing options.

Invading North Korea now would result in a major loss of life, and all indications point to a completely destroyed South Korea if that plan were to come to fruition. 

The U.N. has already imposed sanctions on the regime. The main drawback to this strategy is that millions of North Koreans are already starving, and sanctions would probably make matters worse. It could also lead to a massive exodus of refugees into China ­- a serious problem for the Chinese. 

North Korea clearly does not want to be an international economic pariah, as was made evident by the agreed framework's guideline that the U.S. would move to normalize economic relations with them. 

We could work on resurrecting the old agreed framework, but Bush is unlikely to take this route.

Sadly, the best time to solve this problem has already passed. The Bush administration had an opportunity to prevent this situation and, quite frankly, they blew it.

Headline: Banners promote FAFSA
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst. News Director
&nbsp;
Students seem to forget about or miss the deadline to turn in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, popularly known as FAFSA. This inspired Travis Stokes, the Communications Committee Chair, to use more creative means such as banners to remind them to do it.

Stokes proposed banners that would cost roughly $1300 each, with the bill being paid by the Student Government Association.

"Placing banners at the main entrances to the school will really draw attention," Stokes said.

The FAFSA is one of the most important documents a student seeking financial aid will need. The multi-page electronic document consists of many questions about a student's financial status.

FAFSA's goal: to determine student's expected family contribution, and in turn how much grant money the government will allocate each student.

However, FIU has had trouble getting students to turn the application in on time for several years. While the delay in students turning in their FAFSA causes delays for Enrollment Services, the delay primarily hurts the late students.

"It's basically first come first serve when it comes to grants from FIU," said Michelle Pestaina of the enrollment office. 

According to Pestaina, the various grants that FIU offers have budgets they must conform to such as the National Merit and National Hispanic/Achiever grants.

As a result, students submitting their FAFSA in February will have a higher chance of receiving more aid than those submitting the documents in May.

During an Oct. 13 meeting, Stokes reviewed several ideas for informing students of the March 1 FAFSA deadline.

The banner idea won out.

"I think it depends on how much attention the students pay to the banners," said senior Milene Martinez. "I always turned my FAFSA in on time anyways."

"I turned my last FAFSA documents in late due to an error in filling them out," said sophomore Joel Baez. "I was lucky that I wasn't severely affected. But $1300 for a banner seems too much to pay, even if they keep the FAFSA fresh in your mind."

Students can still submit FAFSA documents for the 2006-2007 academic year.

Submissions for the 2007-2008 year start Jan. 1, so students have until the day before to turn in their documents for 2006-2007, although most likely, turning them in so late would result in receiving zero aid, according to Pestaina. 

"It is critically important for students to turn in their FAFSA documents on time," said Corinne Webb, vice president of enrollment services. "There are approximately 20,000 students who turn in FAFSA documents and it takes a lot of effort to go over them all."

Webb also suggests submitting FAFSA documents via the Internet,  which ensures that FIU receives them earlier.

Hard copies could take weeks to be processed and in turn delay grants.

Florida polling law is declared unconstitutional

A federal judge declared Oct. 17 unconstitutional  a Florida  law prohibiting exit polling within 100 feet of a voting place. 

U.S. District Judge Paul. C. Huck concluded that the 2005 law prohibiting exit pooling violates the First Amendment's freedom of the press.

As a result, the 2005 law will not be enforced in the Nov. 7 elections, but it will remain in effect to limit other activities such as solicitation, distribution of campaign material, or peddling. 

The new ruling came after a lawsuit brought by The Associated Press and five television networks - CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN and Fox who want to conduct exit polls at about 40 Florida precincts during the November elections.

Activists protest city's lack of affordable housing

A group of 40 activists set a camp in a vacant lot at the corner of Northwest 62nd Street and 17th Avenue, in the heart of Liberty City, on Oct. 16 to protest against the city of Miami and Miami-Dade County's failure to build affordable housing.

Along with tents, tarps, and banners that read, "Take back the Land," the group said it planned to build a shantytown to house hundreds of the neighborhood's homeless. 

The group, which includes members of Hope for the Homeless and Hopeless, Inc. and the Fort Lauderdale chapter of Food Not Bombs, intends to provide shelter and food indefinitely.

According to a landmark after Pottinger v. City of Miami, homeless people engaged in "life-sustaining conduct" on public property could not be arrested, and the police warned protestors they would not be arrested unless they obstruct traffic or damage property. 


WORLD:
North Korea rated worst violator of press freedom

An index released this week by Reporters Without Borders puts North Korea as the worst violator of press freedom, while journalists in Finland, Ireland, Iceland and the Netherlands enjoy the most liberty. The United States came at 53 together with Croatia, Botswana and Tonga. 

Following North Korea, the worst offenders, in order, were Turkmenistan, Eritrea, Cuba, Burma, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia. 

Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based advocacy group, relied on its network of 130 correspondents, plus journalists, legal experts and human rights activists. 

Panama Canal approved for expansion

After Panama voters approved to double the 50-mile canal last Sunday, economists believe the expansion could result in cheaper imported Asian products for the U.S.

''There will be an impact on the pocketbook,'' U.S. Ambassador William Eaton to The Miami Herald. "The transit costs will be cheaper and that will have an effect on the market.''

The canal's expansion  won't begin until 2007 and is expected to last eight years. 

About two-thirds of shipping traffic passing through the canal is headed to or coming back from the United States, a figure that will grow after the expansion.

Headline: Club rallies against Coca-Cola
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
The United Students Against Sweatshops at FIU  are gearing up for a major campaign against Coca-Cola. The fledgling chapter of USAS began during the 2006 Spring semester and has just recently begun more active strides in reaching its goals.

Nationwide, there are over 200 chapters of USAS.

The organization is "an international student movement of campuses and individual students fighting for sweatshop free labor conditions and workers' rights," according to www.studentsagainstsweatshops.org.

"We want students to understand that we are fighting for human rights," said sophomore Yaniv Kleinman, one of the founding members of the FIU chapter of USAS.

Coca-Cola has been accused of supporting paramilitary groups responsible for killing labor union leaders in Colombia and pressuring those who joined labor unions to sign documents of resignation with Coca-Cola letterheads.

Due to such business practices, USAS is determined to get Coca-Cola out of universities through a campaign called Killer Coke.

According to Laura Garcia, a member of USAS, FIU is one of six Coca-Cola universities in Florida while some of the larger universities, such as Harvard and New York University, have dropped Coca-Cola due to other  USAS actions.

"We hope to make the number of Coca-Cola universities in Florida five," Garcia said.

One tactic USAS has been using to raise awareness about Coca-Cola is a graphic cardboard replica of a Coca-Cola vending machine. 	

"It gets people to ask questions," Garcia said. "One day we had over 60 people ask for information about Coca-Cola."

"We are being very ambitious," said sophomore and club memeber Zalykha Mokim. "We're an infant at FIU, but I hope to help achieve progressive change."

The Killer Coke campaign isn't the only thing USAS has been up to. Recently members of FIU USAS protested the Dole Fresh Flowers Company's decision to close down several factories in Ecuador and Colombia and lay-off 3,500 workers. 

Allegedly Dole decided to close the factories when the workers there finally formed labor unions. 

While the number of consistently active members of USAS remains small at FIU, the current members are very optimistic about their chapter of USAS. 

"Joining USAS has opened my eyes to the many righteous causes out there," said junior Carlos Isidro. "I think it's a big feat to try and raise awareness about what Coca-Cola is really about." 

Unlike most other clubs and organizations at FIU, USAS does not have the typical structure of organization.

There are no presidents, secretaries or treasurers and  everything is decided by a majority rule vote.

USAS members meet every Tuesday at 3 p.m. in the English Language Institute, room 309, at University Park.

Headline: AFTER THE MOVE: New dorm invokes mixed feelings
Author: Nicole Acosta / BBC Assistant
&nbsp;
Freshman Mindy Kang lives in Lakeview Hall and hates it. She gives her experience living in Lakeview on a scale of one to 10, one being the lowest, a negative five.

"I hate it. It's almost suicidal. I feel like I'm back in high school," Kang said.

In May 2005, construction began for what would become the newest residence hall at FIU. After 16 months of construction, and despite being set back a few months due to the active 2005 hurricane season, Lakeview Hall was approved for official occupancy by the fire marshal last Aug. 16 and students began to move in four days later.

However, minor projects are still being completed throughout the building, such as replacing carpets, fixing creaking elevators, touching up walls with paint and adding the finishing touches on the surrounding landscape. 

Although not fully finished, Lakeview Hall has been selected for several prestigious recognitions. The American School and University magazine selected Lakeview for Outstanding Design in New Residence Hall Construction, and its the only residence hall to be published by the magazine this year. Lakeview Hall has also received recognition from the Southern Builders Association for Residential Construction for a public entity. The Southern College and University Planners Association also decided to honor Lakeview Hall be selecting the project to be part of the showcase in Atlanta next week for Residence Hall Design.

Despite the accolades for its construction, some students, like freshman Vanessa Robinson, said they would "like to see it finished."

"Lakeview Hall looks like a rehab facility, but not as nice," Kang said.

According to James Wassenaar, executive director of student affairs operations and auxiliary services, it usually takes about two months to take care of minor problems that may come with opening a new building. Knowing this, the decision was made to open Lakeview Hall to students in the Fall semester rather than have them situated somewhere off-campus while the minor projects were being fixed.

"It's more important to have students on-campus and being taken care of by University staff than to be placed off-campus in facilities not owned and operated by the University," Wassenaar said.

Accommodating students into a newly opened building meant the students would have to endure the temporary inconveniences Lakeview had to offer along with its brand new facilities.

"It's the things you encounter when you open up a new building. It's the fine-tuning of the building," Wassenaar said.

Wassenaar said that although during the first two to three weeks into the semester the majority of the problems were "successfully resolved," the rest of the problems would be fixed by the end of this week.

Wassenaar also felt that the majority of the residents loved their new home because he has received a lot of positive feedback about Lakeview.

"I perceive in general students are pleased with the facility," he said. "Students have made it their home."

Freshmen Sara Trinchini and Hilary Hess are roommates who loved their rooms, even though they had "issues" earlier in the year with their bathroom lights not working and no hot water for the first few weeks of the semester.

"I would say it's a positive experience. The whole rooming situation is a positive one … the fact that we have our own room," Hess said.

Trinchini and Hess both agreed that they would like to see more activity within the Lakeview community. 

"It's not as active as I thought it would be," Trinchini said. "I just expected more things to be going on outside. We have all this green space and none of it is being used."

Freshman Christian Lobue had nothing but positive things to say about Lakeview's student interaction.

"Everyone is really open and willing to talk. They're personable, especially the Resident Assistants. They're always there to help you out," Lobue said.

Kang said one of the many problems she has had to face since moving in Lakeview Hall are the resident advisors and the staff.

"There are unnecessary authoritative rules. I want to come home and do what I do," Kang said. "People are rude in the [front desk] when they don't need to be, and sometimes, the way the RAs talk to you is not even okay."

Kang and her roommates had to deal with difficulties such as plumbing issues, broken towel racks and malfunctioning Internet connections. She felt the construction in Lakeview Hall is an annoyance that she should be reimbursed for.

"I haven't had any compensation for any kind of inconvenience that we've had," she said. "There's drilling in my floor at 8 a.m. on a Saturday. I didn't pay for this."

Kang also couldn't believe any of Lakeview Hall's residents could actually be satisfied with the building's facilities and living there in general.

"I don't know where they came from, because every person I talk to hates it," Kang said.

Headline: FIU may switch to three day class schedule
Author: Jose De Wit / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
Students may be taking classes Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays by the start of next year's Fall semester after the Faculty Senate passed a measure expanding class schedules in order to bring more money to the University.

The decision was reached Oct. 24 after the senate voted to approve a special committee's report that recommended the University switch to the new schedule to fill up classrooms vacant on Fridays.

The amount of state funding the University receives for construction depends on how efficiently it uses classroom space.

The issue caused great debate. Most senators opposed to the measure cited concern for the students.

"We need to assess how this may affect our students," said professor Laurie Richardson of the biological sciences department. According to Richardson, she has discussed the issue with students in her microbiology classes and received a unanimously negative response. Her students argued that the new schedule would clash with work, internship and volunteering schedules and also result in more time and gas spent commuting an additional day each week.

Other senators argued that FIU's current Monday/Wednesday schedule format gives it an edge over other universities. They mentioned that faculty at other universities often express envy toward FIU professors over their convenient schedules. According to Joan Baker of the English department, FIU's current schedule format attracts many adjunct faculty members who might  choose to work elsewhere.

Still, there was a general consensus among senate members that FIU needs to concentrate on securing state funds in upcoming years.

"The bottom line is the money, and we need the money," said Willie Haskins of the physical therapy department.

The Classroom Space Utilization Committee - the entity that submitted the report on which the decision was based - was created in Spring 2006 to do just that: help the University find ways to improve the use of classroom space, thus securing increased funds.

In November 2005, the Florida Board of Governors Revenue Estimating Conference projected a steep decrease in available Public Education Capital Outlay funds after 2006-07.

Florida awards these funds to public educational institutions specifically for the construction, maintenance and renovation of buildings. The state determines the amount of PECO funds allocated to each institution according to how efficiently it uses its available classroom space.

Each university's classroom utilization is measured by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, a state organization.

FIU ranked the lowest in classroom utilization among all state universities, according to OPPAGA's Spring 2005 report. In order to secure the PECO funds it needs to sustain its growth throughout the next decade, FIU needs to rank above the state median in class utilization.

However, the committee's report did not specify what the University expects to do with the PECO funds.

Senate members who favored the measure argued that, aside from the benefit of increased funding, MWF scheduling represents a welcome change for the University.

"I understand that students don't want this, but maybe what students want isn't what students need or what may ultimately help them," said professor Brian Peterson of the history department.

Professor Howard Rock of the history department argued that some classes are better taught in shorter, 50-minute class periods held three times a week.

"Some of our younger students in lower-division introductory courses have shorter attention spans, and they have trouble listening for 75 minutes," he said.

"We need consistency in our scheduling," said professor Helen Cornely of the Physical Therapy Department. "Regardless of money, it's about time we look at our scheduling."

Interim Provost Ronald Berkman agreed.

"We have to accommodate nearly 39,000 students. Scheduling needs to be as straightforward and simplistic as possible for students," he said.

 The report provided four other recommendations to improve FIU's classroom problem. These included technological improvements to classrooms, scheduling priorities, publishing and implementing an annual class schedule and elimination of non-standard class durations..

These four recommendations were well-received by the senate.

However, the debate over whether to accept the schedule change was complicated by confusion over how classroom utilization is measured.

OPPAGA released its classroom analysis across the statewide university system, but refused to supply any details regarding the methodology used in gathering data or the formulas it used in making its calculations, arguing that its investigations are exempt from Florida Sunshine Laws.

"It's impossible to understand the score if we don't know how it's tabulated," said professor Martha Centeno of the industrial and systems engineering department.

Berkman pushed the debate forward, arguing that, though OPPAGA's analysis could be flawed, the fact remains that it is the standard according to which the University's funds are allocated.

"Maybe OPPAGA's methodology is faulty or bogus, but at least it is bogus across the board. The methodology is the same for all universities," he said.

As the debate came to a close, senate members expressed frustration and indecision.

"We're debating in a fog here," said professor Grover Larkins of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. "Without sufficient information, I don't feel comfortable indicting or supporting the recommendation."

In his closing remarks before the motion came to a vote, Berkman eased senate members' doubts by hinting that the new scheduling format may not be permanent.

"If we find this isn't advantageous to the community, if we find this is hurting students, I'm serious, I'll stop," he said.

Headline: Students' lives disrupted by irrational fears, phobias
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Staff Writer 
&nbsp;
Are you afraid of crossing bridges? If so, then you have gephyrophobia. Afraid of strangers? Xenophobia. Afraid of sunlight? Heliophobia, and you just might be a vampire. 

The list goes on as there are hundreds of named phobias out there and countless more that have yet to be named. 

"Phobias are a fear of a situation or object that go to extensive levels," said psychology professor Lindsay Ham. 	     In other words, just because you may be afraid of something doesn't mean you have a phobia. If that were the case, then just about everyone in the world would suffer from numerous phobias. This is because fear is a basic human emotion. 

"There is a combination of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to whether or not someone will develop a phobia," Ham said. 

This is where some phobias become rational or irrational. 

"I'm afraid of car accidents," said sophomore Melissa Cordova. "I was in a car accident once, and I almost died in it."

In Cordova's case, her fear of being in a car accident is justified as she went through the experience once before - this is known as a rational fear. 

On the other hand, if she were simply afraid of cars, it would be considered an irrational fear.

When one looks at fear from an economical point of view, it's big business and in high demand. Movies like The Grudge 2 and Saw 2 brought in $20 and $30 million, respectively, in their opening weekends, and haunted theme parks such as Universal Studio's Halloween Horror Nights have also been profitable. 

"I had a lot of fun there," said sophomore Jade Garcia. "I was on edge the whole time, not knowing if someone was going to jump out at me. It was a good feeling."

This leaves some to wonder what the appeal of it all is.

"[The appeal of fear is that] it's kind of the same thing as people who like to take risks," Ham said. "Bungee jumping, for example - for some, it feels scary but for others, it's a good feeling." 

With Halloween right around the corner, it's no surprise to see a lot of scary movies playing in theatres. 

"Scary movies are more exciting than regular movies," said freshman Jenni Gamas. "They get your adrenaline pumping."

While some moviemakers revel in fake horror, others live them daily. The solution to getting over a phobia can be frightfully unnerving, depending on who you are. 

"No one wants to hear it, but you have to face it regularly," Ham said. "If you're afraid of heights then you should go to the top of a high building. In some severe cases, though, one may have to seek out a therapist."

FIU students who need help getting over a phobia can go to the University's Counseling Services Center in the Health and Wellness Center.

"The first time a student comes into the office, they would see the psychologist on call for walk-in students," said University Psychologist Seth Grossman.  

From there, the psychologist would evaluate the student to determine the severity of the phobia, if one even exists. 

"For the simple phobias, a student would see someone here," Grossman said. 

The course of treatment for simple or specific phobias would first be to talk about the phobia. 

If it were a phobia about rats, for example, the next step would be for the psychologist to show the student a picture of a rat.

"The point of the therapy would be to get the patient more comfortable with whatever it is they are afraid of," Grossman said.  "But if it's determined to be a serious phobia, we would perform what we call a medical rule out. This is to make sure that the symptoms we observe are not due to a medical condition."

The most extreme cases of phobias can cause students to have panic attacks at the mere thought of the phobia, according to Grossman. 

In those extreme cases, students could continue treatment at the Counseling Center or be referred to an outside therapist by the center.

Headline: Trivial Pursuit...a pop culture column: Apathy felt toward useless holiday
Author: Reuben Pereira / Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I've never understood the appeal of Halloween.

Maybe it's because I've never dressed up or maybe it's because I'm just too cheap to go out and buy an antelope outfit and look like a moron. It could be the fact that I didn't grow up in this country. After all, Halloween is a predominantly American holiday. 

It could be every one of the above reasons but to keep it straightforward and simple, I've never cared much about the holiday - apart from some of the fun parties that it brings. 

In the past, Halloween used to be a one-night thing where children dressed up in their favorite "scary" costumes, visiting neighbors for "Trick or Treating." 

What kids never realized was they'd be getting a bad deal regardless - either you're going to get the crap scared out of you or you're going to be visiting the dentist soon.

Today's Halloween is a multi-billion dollar gold mine for retailers who've been looking to fill that gap between "Back to School" and the holiday seasons. You name it, you got it: costumes, greeting cards, parties, food, movies, music, TV shows, etc.

Every year, Halloween starts to resemble Christmas, only replace the Christmas trees with pumpkins. The entire month of October can be considered Halloween now. In some cases, even the last week of September. 

Just like Christmas, you can't escape it - pumpkins, cobwebs, tombstones and witches, they're everywhere. People actually send out greeting cards wishing each other a very "Happy Halloween." 

It's only a matter of time before retailers come up with an idea to mimic Christmas carols. That's something that requires a little bit of creativity. Does Michael Jackson's "Thriller" make the cut anymore? I guess not on a holiday that primarily involves kids.

Every year, the media finds some excuse to expand the celebrations by at least an additional week. Just look at Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights. It used to be a week of events that were a waste of money. Now, it's an entire month that's a waste of money. Standing in line for two hours only to end up walking through a cold, gloomy pathway accented by actors moaning and grunting isn't my cup of tea. 

If it weren't for the legal issues and liabilities, the event would be a much darker, thrilling event.

To many adults and teens, costumes are the best part of Halloween apart from getting drunk and being made fun of for not being creative enough. 

Just the other day at work, a colleague of mine was ecstatic about receiving her French maid outfit in the mail - an item that she spent more than $60 on. Minutes later, she received a call from the costume company saying that they've run out of French maid outfits.

Her mood took a 180 degree turn after that call. It looked like she'd have to settle for her $70 Queen of Hearts outfit. Bummer!

To most women, Halloween is the only holiday of the year where they can look like a slut and get away with it. 

That would explain the abundance of French maids, dominatrix and bunnies at every Halloween party. It's that one time of the year when no one will judge them by what they wear. And women say men are hypocrites.

For guys, the less said, the better. We don't have much of a choice outside pirates, grim reapers and zombies, unless you want to spend more than $100 dollars for that Care Bear outfit that'll get you a couple of hugs, bad body odor and nothing more.

Every year I try to get into the spirit of Halloween and actually think about what I'm going to wear.

Every year, it doesn't pan out because I don't have the time or the money. This year sounds promising. Well, maybe not. Who knows, maybe, I'll dress up as a "party pooper nerd" It wouldn't be a stretch.

Headline: Last-minute costumes range from cheap to absurd
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
So you've just realized it's 5 p.m. on Halloween, and you don't have a costume. The party of the year won't wait for you or your mission through the war-torn battle zone that is Party City. Not to mention, even if you went now, you'd only have the option of buying the over-priced, partially missing costumes that no one wants or haven't been relevant for years - a Scream mask, half of a horse or a Neo-from-The-Matrix costume aren't worth buying. Here are some ideas to make your last-minute outfit a memorable one.


Concepts:
Now that you are immersed in higher education, why not reflect it with your costume? Take a concept you learned in class and embody it. If you look disheveled yet indifferent you could go as "nihilism." If you're feeling controlling and organized, be "socialism." Just don't forget to pass out equal amounts of candy to everyone. If you want, roll around in some various paints and be "abstract expressionism." The possibilities are endless.



Your Mom:
Everyone has one at one point, and usually they try to indulge us, so why not pay tribute to those who brought us into the world? All you have to do is walk into her closet and pick out an outfit. Grab some oven mitts and an apron if you're going for the traditional look. The costume is purely for the dialogue: "Who are you supposed to be?" they will ask, to which you reply, "Your mom."

I'd dress up as my mom, but I have a hard time mimicking her "why aren't you a pre-med major?" face.

Mummy:
Even if you had to stop by a gas station on the way to the party, this would be an easy costume to pull off. You could assemble this costume en route. The trick? Toilet paper. Two-ply if you're feeling fancy. Just unravel around your limbs and body, tuck in the ends and you've got a bona fide mummy ready for undead action. Take caution, however; this costume rips easily. If it unravels, you can say you're a vandalized house or stand in front of the bathroom and charge people for a piece.

Another Holiday:
It's hard to find Halloween costumes on Halloween, but boy is it easy to find Christmas decorations. Just wrap yourself in lights and tinsel and be a tree. Add a cardboard box and you could be "everyone's attic for 11 months of the year."

Adam or Eve:
Your birthday suit is the cheapest and most readily available costume you have. All you need to add is some strategically placed foliage. Just make sure it's not poisonous or will cause you to break out in hives. On the seventh day, God rested, not invented Benedryl.

Paper Boy:
The late '90s and early '00s assured that everyone has a messenger bag. Just grab a timely stack of The Beacon and spread the joy that is college media. What better way to inform your student body of topical information that affects your everyday life? I know we'd appreciate it.

Headline: HORRIFIC: Real-life murder stories saturate entertainment, desensitize audience
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Asst. Life! Editor
&nbsp;
When asked to name a serial killer, junior Luis Guerrero replied swiftly.

"That's easy. Jeffrey Dahmer."

With Halloween around the corner, carved pumpkins, fake skeletons and excessive amounts of sugary treats are making their appearances in stores and homes. However, the spooky holiday also brings focus to other Halloween staples that aren't as lighthearted as "The Monster Mash." Murder and death are recurrent themes permeating many Halloween celebrations and events. 

This year, Universal Studios Orlando is hosting its sixteenth annual "Halloween Horror Nights" celebration, an event that invites visitors to go through various haunted houses, including one dedicated to the fictional murderer Norman Bates, the killer from the film Psycho. Similarly, horror movies such as The Grudge 2 and Saw 3 have been or are set to be released around the holiday. Other movies with a focus on murder, such as The Black Dahlia, which tells the story of an unsolved California killing, were released earlier this year.

So why is society willing to experience violent entertainment?

Psychology professor Jeremy Holm believes people participate in such entertainment for the emotional responses it elicits.

"People like to watch violence on television and film for the same reason they enjoy watching athletic events," he said."Being shocked by a horror film can give people the emotional rush they look for."

For students like sophomore Lillian Marquez, violence can be both horrifying and intriguing.

"Even though we don't like to admit it, we find violence fascinating," she said. "For example, we stare at car accidents as we drive past them. Even the news has lots of coverage on murders and accidents but dedicates only a few minutes to 'soft' stories like kittens stuck up a tree."

While some people admit being fascinated by violence, others such as freshman Jenny Baluja find entertainment value in watching such violent acts depicted on television and other mediums.

"It's fun to watch violence on film because it's so outrageous that it can't be taken seriously," she said. "It's very imaginative, and in the end, you know that no one is really dying."

Nevertheless, the murderers from films such as Psycho and The Black Dahlia are based on real-life characters. Bates, the killer in Psycho, is based on Wisconsin serial killer Edward Gein. According to CrimeLibrary.com, Gein was known for gutting bodies and decapitating his victims, particularly women. He even made clothing items from his victims' bodies; at his home, police discovered a suit made of human skin and a belt made of nipples, according to the website. 

Another serial killer glamorized by the media is David Berkowitz, otherwise known as the "Son of Sam," who was a focal point of Spike Lee's Summer of Sam. Berkowitz gained notoriety by killing six people and injuring several others in New York City, according to Crime Library.  

The website CrimeSpider.com contains links to sites detailing the murders committed not only by these two murderers, but also other infamous killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, who engaged in necrophilia and cannibalism. With so many websites offering in-depth data about these murderers' crimes, could people emulate past killers by using this information?

Junior Ociel Corada thinks so.

"There's a lot of information available on the Internet at people's disposal," he said. "If someone who isn't right in the head reads in detail about the way someone was killed, they might want to copy it."

According to Holm, some people may not be able to distinguish between violence in television and violence in real life.

"Research over the past 30 years on television violence has shown that it can lead to kids mimicking that sort of violence," Holm said. "There hasn't been enough research done to show the same connection in adults, but children are susceptible."

Holm stresses that, aside from the possibilities of mimicry, overexposure to violence results in desensitization.

"What we do know is that the more we watch violence, the less shocked we are when we experience it in real life," he said. "It desensitizes both children and adults."

Headline: Diversity day teaches tolerance
Author: Alexandra McAnarney Jr. / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
When Judith Williams, founder of Catered Creations in Miami
and FIU alumna, spoke about prejudices she has personally
experienced during the seventh annual Diversity Day, she spoke of the tribulations she and her partner faced when adopting her son.

"[The Home] said they would rather have him adopted by an
alcoholic than by lesbians," Williams said.

Teaching tolerance towards people of different races, cultural
backgrounds and sexual orientations is why Diversity Day, hosted by the offi ce of multicultural programs and services, was held Oct. 19 at the Wolfe University Center Ballrooms.

"Diversity is truly at the heart of this University," said Vice Provost Damian Fernandez as students and faculty milled round eating lunch.

The food, which consisted of meatballs, rice, salad and chocolate cake, was put together by Diann Newman, an assistant professor for the school of hospitality management.

Diversity Day began with an activity organized by Susan
McCarthy-Miller, a professor from Springfi eld College in Massachusetts. 

The activity, called "Bafa, Bafa," was a cultural simulation game, where students split into two groups assuming a new culture and spoke of the assumptions each student made of the other.

They traded currency and tried to understand each other's
language to no avail. 

Biomedical engineering major Steven Kumar found the "Bafa,
Bafa" game intriguing.

"People shouldn't talk about people they don't know," Kumar
said. "I'm Colombian Indian; it's an uncommon mix. It was a very interesting experiment that they had."

Following the game, a piece was performed by the FIU step
dancers, who stomped rhythmically on the stage as well as
a Hindi dance performed by Arminda Pravida, the chair of the
Diversity Day event.

Several speakers were seated on stage headed by AJ Costa, the
graduate assistant for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Ally Association, to present a sexual orientation panel.

Among the speakers were Williams, Daniel Anzueto, a resident advisor for Bay Vista Housing, and Oscar Laynz, an FIU alumnus and associate director for the Health and Wellness Center.

The panel spoke of their life experiences being gay or straight,
their home life and their workplace.

Costa talked about how her mother helped her become an
advocate for the LGBTQ community.

"Since [youth], the [LGBTQ community] has been a part of my
life when I realized at age 10 that my mom and her partner were not just roommates," she said.

Following the discussions presented by the guest speakers,
students were able to ask provocative questions about homosexual civil rights, equality in the workplace and government cover ups in recent cases of violence towards
homosexuals.

Laynz was happy to be of assistance in answering students'
questions about LGBTQ issues.

"Whenever there's an opportunity to see things in a different
light I'm glad to help," Laynz said.

A scene from the Pulitzer Prize winning play Anna in the
Tropics was presented. The play was about a married couple in
the 1920's who work as cigar rollers in Florida.

The play, performed by drama students Maritxel Tarrero
and Jose Urvino, was the final event on the itinerary of
Diversity Day.

Danesh Sujanani, who is majoring in hospitality, said Diversity
Day was a benefi cial and worthwhile experience.

"This was a very informative event, lots of different people,
different cultures and ethnic backgrounds," Sujanani said.

"The food was a success, there was a good turn out. Overall, I
would say this event was a success.

Headline: New club seeks to open networking opportunities
Author: David Rodriquez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Media-On-Demand is a gateway for media students to access networking connections.

A group dedicated to all communications majors, they have formed the club to unite the majors under one association.

"By meeting other students now, the benefi ts will come later in their professional lives," said Mike Pina, the club's vicepresident.

According to the club members, their beginnings were random. However, once they began, the focused on spreading the word about Media-On-Demand via e-mail and through MySpace.

"I fi lmed a video during a marketing class that [Steven Ramirez], the club president, helped out in. I gave him a copy of the tape as a thanks for helping out and like a week later he called me and said we should do something different for FIU
media students," Pina said.

"We realized many clubs they have for students at FIU are weak, so we got a group of talented guys together and did something
not necessarily different but unique."

According to Pina, opportunities to network are hard to come by or are expensive, though they are important in the business
world.

Media-On-Demand wants to act as that source to start students off with real work experience that will later lead to job
opportunities, he said.

Of the ten to twelve that founded the club, a myriad of different majors meet to donate their time.

From advertising to TV production to business administration and even a nursing student, various schools of thought are
brought together.

Members are treated to a rundown of the club's goals as explained by the founding members during their first meeting.

Though the purpose is to increase contacts for those majoring in communications, all majors are welcomed to come and network as well.

"Our main purpose is to build a network of media students, work among the students to provide real world experience such as outside agencies speaking to the students and changing the atmosphere of the school," Pina said.

Though the project started out as a promotions committee intended to promote events for the Student Government Association at Biscayne Bay Campus, it soon became something more.

Ramirez created something on a larger scale: a club on campus that served all other media clubs.

"I realized there was no offi cial club for [students majoring in communications] to attend, so I went for it," said Ramirez.

Organizations like this one benefi t the student body by allowing fellow students to meet people they might not meet otherwise, Ramirez said.

Junior Tiffany Parks said she wants more from a club then just social interaction.

"It has to bring something new to the table, because I can always meet new people elsewhere, though free food is always a strong draw."

Junior Shaun Wright shares some of Tiffany's concerns.

"If it is only about people meeting up and chatting, I am not interested. Now, if it is about getting people together to create
better things - say, two people from different majors in media to make a TV show or a website - then that sparks anyone's
interest," he said.

Ramirez is enthusiastic about Media-On-Demand's long term goals.

"My greatest goal is to create an organization that encompasses all clubs within the SJMC here at BBC," he said. "We have made our presence felt so far, but it is an ongoing effort. Nobody has done this before, the possibilities are endless."
