Headline: Health fee increase decision postponed
Subheadline: More time needed to consider student input
Author:  Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The final voting on the proposed health fee increase by the University Fee Committee has been postponed to later this week, according to University Park  Student Government Association President Alex Prado.

The health fee increase was proposed to provide more services and add more physicians at the Health and Wellness Centers at University Park and Biscayne Bay Campus, according to John Bonanno, assistant president of student affairs.

Originally set for Feb. 23, the vote on the fee increase was pushed back because of the issue's importance and its university-wide impact on students.

"It was felt that postponing the vote until next week was in the committee's best interests, said University Fee Committee Representative Greg Olson. Because of the importance the issue has on students, it was felt that more consideration of the issue was needed before a decision should be made." 

Prado acknowledged needing more time to consider the health fee increase.

"I didn't think that having the vote almost immediately after the UP public hearing was enough time to really reflect upon what was brought up in the public hearing. The postponement lets the committee have a little while longer to deliberate," Prado said.

Aside from requiring more time for deliberations, the voting was delayed because of scheduling conflicts between committee representatives. Since some of the representatives work at the Biscayne Bay Campus, scheduling a meeting time has been a difficult task.As a result, Committee Chairman Charles Tinder sent out an e-mail to committee representatives, asking them to suggest convenient meeting times.

If approved by a majority vote, the $13.20 proposed fee increase would go into effect Fall 2006 and raise the current fee of $54 to $67.20.  Although the final vote on the increase was delayed, the last of two scheduled public hearings took place at UP Feb. 22.  

State law requires that public hearings be held to inform students of the proposed increase. 

The first public hearing about the health fee increase occurred Feb. 15 at Biscayne Bay Campus. 

"The second hearing had about 45 to 50 students in attendance. This crowd was larger compared to the 25 students who showed up to the BBC hearing," Olson said.

According to Prado, the UP hearing was a success.

"We had many students show up and ask questions about the health fee to the various representatives present at the hearing". 

"Questions were consistently asked throughout the whole hour the hearing lasted," Prado said.  

At the hearing, University Fee Committee representatives were in attendance as well as representatives from the Health and Wellness Center, the Office of Disability Services, the Victim Advocacy Center and the Counseling and Psychological Services Center. 

These representatives answered questions posed by students at the public hearing. 

SGA Representative-at-Large Alfonso Leon was thrilled about the hearing's turnout. 

"The amount of student input was impressive. At one point, the entire SGA chamber was full of students listening and discussing the different aspects of the health fee increase," Leon said. 

Students asked questions regarding the necessity of the health fee increase.

"Students asked whether the increase was truly necessary and if the budget allocated money toward adding more physicians and expanding services already in place," Leon said.

Prior to the UP hearing, SGA representatives distributed surveys to find out what benefits students wanted to see as a result of the health fee increase. 

The surveys specifically asked students if they wanted the Health and Wellness Center to extend its operating hours. The center is currently open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

According to Leon, SGA expected to collect over 2,000 surveys by Feb. 22. 

The deadline, however, was extended to Feb. 23 because surveys from housing students and various organizations were still pending. A copy of the survey results will be given to the University Fee Committee for consideration.

"The results won't be complete until those pending surveys are counted. Once the results are in, the University Fee Committee will receive a copy of the results to analyze and discuss," Leon said.

Headline: Breezeway Café hours cut due to financial reasons
Author:  Jose Pagliery / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Breezeway Café cut its 24-hours of operation on weekdays starting this Spring semester due to financial reasons.

The store (located beneath the University Park Towers residence halls) had been operating on a 24-hour schedule Mondays through Thursdays since October 2005.

Although Aramark officials stated that the extended hours were implemented for students' convenience, late-night sales did not match student demands. 

As a result, Aramark has chosen to keep the store closed during early morning hours due to problems with efficiency, though they would not specify the new hours of operation.

Some students disagree with the move. 

"One day I came in, and it was closed," said junior Elie Philippe.  

A student in the music program, Philippe explained that rehearsals take up most of his time, allowing him little time to do shopping elsewhere.  

"I used to go two or three times a week," he said. "Places like Publix are only open until 11 p.m."   

As it turns out, Aramark's decision was not unwarranted, according to Breezeway employees. 

After two in the morning, we don't have sales, said Leticia Palma, manager at the Breezeway Café.  

She stated that few students have approached her with complaints about the adjustment, further justifying her claims.  

Employees at the store, such as Carlos Rodriguez, said that many students claim that they still need to make those late-night stops. 

However, Rodriguez disagrees.

"Between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m., we didn't have enough sales," Rodriguez said.  

Rodriguez went on to explain that initially the Café would make anywhere between $150-$200 a night, but the numbers would continue to drop.  

Although management kept the place open with two employees, it was soon forced to reduce itself to simply having a supervisor attending the store.  

Although Rodriguez regrets that it can be quite inconvenient for residents at the Towers and other residence halls, he stills agrees with the logic, as do other students.

"[Being open 24 hours] doesn't seem very economical," said junior Brandon Viani. 

Despite the fact that he lives on campus at the Towers, he doesn't seem to be affected by the decision, and agrees with Aramark.  

"It's nice to get a snack there, but I'm not going to lose any sleep over it," Viani said.

Although some students and faculty members have disagreed with the decision, many of those asked understand and concur with the reasoning.  

Some even say that complaints have arisen from a whole other issue, namely, pricing.

James Wassenaar, executive director of Student Affairs Operations and Auxiliary Services, said "They were experimenting and they based new hours on efficiency. I haven't heard any concerns over hours of operation. I've heard concerns regarding competitive pricing."  

Wassenaar explained that students compare the store's prices with Publix and other supermarkets, but that "they compete with 7-Eleven and Quick Stop."

Headline: Celebrities' fame help further political goals
Author: Enrica Ryman / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Celebrities are placed on the top of the social pedestal. Whether they are admired by all or secretly hated, all eyes are on them. Maybe that's why celebrities are politically outspoken and find themselves involved in so many controversies. We need to keep in mind that celebrities are human and are entitled to their freedom of speech. They should be able to talk about what they want just like everyone else. 

Take, for example, Alec Baldwin, who in 2000 threatened to leave the United States if George W. Bush was the elected candidate. After Bush won the election, however, Baldwin stayed, which brought some critics to wonder how serious he really was. 

If Baldwin were a regular guy on the street, the remark he made probably wouldn't have mattered as much as it did. His comments may not have sat well with Bush supporters but it was what he felt. 

Celebrities have more money, more exposure and therefore more influence when it comes to swaying the public's political decisions. That said, it would make sense for them to become politically active. 

Every politically active person in America wishes they had the kind of attention that celebrities receive everyday, having millions of people seeing their point of view, in the hopes of swaying stances on certain issues. Some celebrities use their art to make a statement.

 They make movies and productions to try and sway others votes or open their eyes to something they might not have seen before. George Clooney is an example of this type of influential individual. His most recent movies, Good Night, and Good Luck and Syriana both deal with political issues and situations. 

Good Night, and Good Luck centers around a newscast duo and their journey to help bring down one of the most controversial senators in American history, Senator Joseph McCarthy. George Clooney co-wrote and directed the film. 

Syriana, on the other hand, is a story about oil conspiracy in the Middle East. Clooney has a key role in the film as a career CIA operative who begins to discover the truth behind the works he devoted himself to. 

George Clooney has been crowned Hollywood's Mr. Politics. 

Celebrities always stand to lose more when they're politically active, which is admirable but sometimes can be foolish. There are those whose status increases because they lay everything on the line. Those individuals achieve celebrity status because of their political affiliation. The most notable example of an outspoken celebrity is Michael Moore. His films have gained more publicity than most documentaries. 

I had heard murmurs of Michael Moore's film, Bowling for Columbine, but really took notice of who he was when Fahrenheit 9/11 hit theatres. Moore's documentary focused on the unanswered questions left up in the air by President Bush in the 2000 election and beyond. Though his intentions were admirable, Moore's plan of having Fahrenheit 9/11 viewed by more Americans before the 2004 elections by having it included in the Academy Awards for "Best Picture" failed.  

Bottom line, whether or not we'd like to admit it, celebrities have a lot of influence on the public. At the same time I believe we are entitled to our freedom of speech. Why should it matter when a random celebrity comments on how this country is being run? It is his individual comment, his thoughts and his feelings on a certain situation. Even though celebrities may have more money than the rest of us, more publicity than the average American could ever dream of, in the end we are all American.

Headline: Iran situation delicate
Author:  Luis Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As tension continues to mount in the Middle East, Iran furthers its nuclear program and continues to ignore peace efforts from the rest of the world. 

The United States is not the only country concerned with Iran's uranium enrichment. This is one issue that cannot be ignored in the shadow of restoring order in Iraq and Israeli relations with Hamas.

There are a lot of dangers with the use of nuclear energy. While scientists continue to research ways to harness nuclear energy's potential benefits, a lot of people tend to think only about the damage nuclear weapons can cause. Looking back at history, it is easy to see why. The Cold War is a prime example of how paralyzing the threat of nuclear weapons can be. If left unchecked, Iran may become the next nuclear threat.

So far, Iran has warned that they will break away from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if they continue to be threatened by other nations. 

Iran has also postponed talks with Russia that would have allowed the country to enrich uranium but not for use in weapons; a plan that was approved by the United States and its allies.  

All this leads one to wonder: Why is Iran cutting corners with uranium enrichment and being so defensive when it comes to their nuclear program by not allowing inspectors? 

On top of that, why threaten to break from the nuclear pact altogether? If Iran insists that they are not enriching uranium for nuclear armaments, they should just allow other nations, like Russia, to inspect and ensure safety.

With tensions already running high in the Middle East, this can cause even more unrest if Iran decides to go further with their research. With the situation being as delicate and as urgent as it is, world leaders cannot afford to take any chances or unnecessary risks. 

If the Iran nuclear episode develops into something far worse, action must be taken to prevent another nuclear crisis. 

However, the last thing people want to think about right now is sending more troops to the Middle East. Ideally, this situation should be handled on the diplomatic level before it could escalate further.

The United States must solve this problem without putting more lives at risk. While the U.S. does have help from other nations in this affair, Iran is still not cooperating as they need to be.  

What Iran plans to do with uranium is not a matter that can be ignored by the rest of the world, especially if it could lead to another war. With the Middle East already in turmoil, this situation could be a powder keg waiting to explode if left unchecked.

Subheadline: Students' apathy towards tuition raises questions
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
The University held a public hearing at the University Park Graham Center Feb. 22 to inform students of a proposed increase in the health fee. Out of the estimated 36,000 students enrolled at FIU, approximately 50 students showed up.

Great news, according to student officials of the UP Student Government Association, touting the hearing attendance and student input at the meeting as "impressive."  If a turnout of 50 students is successful according to SGA, we shudder to think what they would consider to be a poor turnout.

With so many items at its disposal, it's a shame that the University and SGA did not promote these hearings as much as they could have, despite the effects the proposed increase will have on students' tuition if passed. The Graham Center is, at times, virtually plastered with different propaganda for sport and spirit events, all of which are of questionable importance when compared to the increase of tuition, which affects all students. More should have been done to alert the public of these hearings.  

The blame, however, should not fall entirely on the members of SGA or the University. To their credit, they placed an ad in The Beacon, passed out surveys and held two separate hearings - one for each campus. In actuality, the responsibility of attending these hearings and voicing concerns lies with the students.

It is estimated that an average 70 students attend the film events that the Student Programming Council holds roughly every other week. It is disgraceful that students can find the time to 'catch a flick,' yet are hard pressed to spare 30 minutes to inquire why the University wants them to pay more tuition.

At this point, the legitimacy of the proposal by the University becomes irrelevant. Whether or not this increase in tuition is desperately needed or completely pointless is besides the fact - nobody seems to care anyway.  

Students will argue that their schedule does not allow them to attend these meetings. Yet, students are urged to consider the following: tuition has nowhere to go but up. The past few years and the years to come will see a crescendo of tuition increases. If the governor has his way, tuition will go up an estimated 30 percent statewide. The increase of $13.20 may not seem like a lot to you now, but these things add up and before you know it, your wallet is empty.

Most of all, if tuition does indeed go up, at least make sure that yours was not one of the muted voices - whose apathy let it happen.

Headline: Memoir still good despite lies
Author: Brian Gonzalez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Author and screenplay writer James Frey had his first successful book published in April 2003, "A Million Little Pieces." In his memoir - which retells the story of his battles with drugs and alcohol - he goes into explicit detail retelling the horrid events that took place in his life. 

One of the more disturbing chapters in the book was when Frey goes to a clinic for dental surgery without anesthesia or painkillers. After reading this piece, I almost considered canceling my dental appointment.

In September 2005, talk show host Oprah Winfrey chose "A Million Little Pieces" for her monthly book club, which elevated the memoir to the bestseller list, with over two million copies sold. 

In late 2005, however, reports surfaced that the shock-filled memoir was actually a string of fabricated lies. Because of this, Frey was suddenly under more publicity than he could have hoped for. 

Frey went on the offensive to defend his book; he was even defended by Winfrey on Larry King Live. Not until sources like smokinggun.com and others defended the allegations, was it clear that not all was true in Frey's autobiography. 

Forced by the media and his publisher, Frey appeared on the "Oprah Winfrey Show" once more to set the record straight.

 With Winfrey verbally attacking him, Frey gave less than clear answers about whether or not some of the chapters were true or not. "When I talk about the characters in the book, I always talk about them as the characters in the book ... I talk about them not how they are in real life but how they are in the book," sad Frey on the show. 

FIU freshman Christopher Cortes thinks that "unless it was aimed to hurt and/or make someone look bad, I don't think lying in a book just so it could sell should matter ... just because the media highly publicizes this doesn't make it any different." 

I would have to agree on Cortes's thoughts, there is probably not one autobiography that is 100 percent accurate; much less completely truthful. 

But I'm not talking about truth-value here, I'm talking about whether it is morally wrong - and I do not think so. I believe Frey might have taken it too far defending the lies till the end, but to write them in to make a book interesting is completely acceptable. Whether or not some stories are true, people are inspired by these books. 

If I found out tomorrow that Dave Pelzer's, "A Child Named 'It'" wasn't completely honest, I would not be angry. The book was more than just the gruesome tortures of a child's abusive mother, it was about the hope that the child could overcome that punishment, much like James Frey's book.

I, however, can understand where people that are angry are coming from, when I found out that an ex-drug addict/alcoholic was also a liar I shouted "Blasphemy!" 

But, in all seriousness, forgive the man, forget the media and pick up this excellent book. Don't expect a memoir, just a great read.

Headline: Letter to the Editor
Author: Marcos Belen / Junior / Journalism and Mass Communications Major
&nbsp;
This letter is in response to the article "Dem Franchize Boyz fail to deliver." 

Neglecting the fact that the article begins with a grammar mistake, the rest of the article speaks nothing to those who follow rap music or to those who don't listen to it on a regular basis.

I'm even surprised I read the article because the headline said nothing to me. The only thing that attracted me was the picture that went along with the article, not the content in it.

The whole article relates on one negative finding the writer found in the album - the resemblance between the group and other hip-hop artists. How many times is the same defense going to be repeated?

If a review is going to tell me an album deserves less than three stars, then it better have more than one repetitive reason.

The writer argues about their lack of good lyrics, yet sites no examples. Also, is it possible to site one rap artist with insightful lyrics? The song chosen as an example is called "Freaky As She Wanna Be" for God's sake. 

There are also many rap terms referred to in the article, assuming that the audience knows what they mean - something a true journalist should never do. "The group's crunk style can't disguise the similarities on the chorus to Fat Joe's 'Lean Back.' The beat and flow are identical."

What exactly is "crunk" style? What is this "rap flow" keeps being referred to throughout the article? Care to explain anything? If this is the way this writer writes, I would love to hear him speak.

And, of course, this group's album won't be stacked next to Jay-Z and Tupac; they're "Dem Franchize Boyz."

Headline: Women's basketball suffers tough loss to WKU
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It was a thriller Feb. 23 at Pharmed Arena as the Golden Panthers lost to Sun-Belt Conference leading Western Kentucky.

The game was an uptempo battle all the way through as the Lady Toppers  did not let FIU get back in the game and in the end, had enough to come up with the 76-67 victory.

The loss puts FIU at 15-11 and 8-5 versus Sun-Belt Conference foes, but most importantly, kills their shot at tying for first place in the conference.  Western Kentucky improves to 21-5 and are now in sole possession of the East Division lead as they get set to play Middle Tennessee in a crucial game on Feb. 27.

Midway through the second half, Western Kentucky went on an 8-0 run to put them up by 13. That forced head coach Cindy Russo to call a timeout, which proved worthy as the Golden Panthers countered with a 15-4 run that brought them within two, thanks to three 3-pointers by LaQuetta Ferguson.

"I just told them to settle down and not let them rattle us," Russo said.  "We know we're capable of playing with that team, it's just a matter of believing."

But foul trouble made the comeback very difficult for FIU, as they were over the limit with over 5:30 remaining.  

Trailing 68-65, FIU came with a set play for freshman Iva Ciglar, who missed the jumper as FIU was forced to keep fouling Western Kentucky. They outscored the Golden Panthers by 13 from the line in the second half.

The Golden Panthers' only lead of the game came in the first possession. Since then, they were in an uphill battle as the Lady Toppers came with a full-court press that seemed to take FIU out of sync - causing the team to commit three turnovers in the first three minutes of the game.

"Putting that pressure on for 40 minutes really wears a team out," Russo said.  "But I think we executed our offense better than the first meeting."

The Golden Panthers were outscored in the paint 50-32 and committed 13 more turnovers than Western Kentucky. But despite all their problems, they were able to stay in the game thanks to some help from reserves Marquita Adley and Ciglar.

Ciglar busted out with a career night as she put up 21 points and four assists. 

Freshman forward Marquita Adley contributed 10 points and eight rebounds in just 21 minutes of play.

"They've been doing that all year,"  Russo said. "[Adley] is just a solid, strong player and we need that kind of player in there to crash the boards."

Western Kentucky forward Crystal Kelly had another big game against FIU.  She came up with 25 points and 10 rebounds to add to the 17 points and 13 rebounds she had the previous meeting, where WKU won by 22 points.

Despite a tough loss late in the season, the Golden Panthers were proud of keeping up with a tough team.

"I think we did a good job of executing today," Ciglar said. "I definitely have confidence in my team that we can bounce back and stay strong."

FIU will have a chance to bounce back in its last game of the season, which brings 17-8 Middle Tennessee to town Feb. 27. The game will be the last home game for senior point guard Faeza Bouderra, who recorded four points, seven rebounds and seven assists.

"I just want to win the next game for [her], to put a ring on her finger before she leaves would be spectacular … I [also] want to apologize because this would've been her first win versus Western Kentucky," Ciglar said about her fellow point guard

Tip-off time for the game against Middle Tennessee will be 7 p.m. at the Pharmed Arena.

Headline: Spanish play-by-play voice talks about college sports
Subheadline: ~ Part one of a two-part interview ~
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With the FIU sports scene ready to switch gears with the Sun Belt Conference Tournament and the baseball season already underway, The Beacon sat down with "El Decano de los Deportes," Jerry Del Castillo, the play-by-play voice of Golden Panther sports in Spanish. 

Having been the host of the successful radio show "Onda Deportiva" and Channel 41's "Descarga Deportiva," Del Castillo and his crew can now be heard daily at 6 p.m. on Cadena Azul 1550. Apart from his talk show success, Del Castillo covered the Univeristy of Miami Hurricanes through national championships and College World Series victories from 1994-2002 and has done extensive work with the Miami Heat. He and his crew began covering FIU in 2002, for the inaugural football season. 

Q: How did you get started in the business?

Pretty much by accident. Somebody liked my voice and I started doing a sports talk show on Sunday mornings on the old 1360, I did it with [560 WQAM radio personality] Orlando Alzugaray - "The big O." [Alzugaray and I] used to do something called "Homegrown Sports." 

Then, I ended up going to Spanish radio. I got invited to a show and was then invited back to do a show. It grew from there; it mushroomed. 

I started doing Heat and UM games. I did color [commentary] for the Heat games and play-by-play and color for UM games. I did UM games for about seven years before I came to FIU.     

Q: You have, for many years, been the Spanish voice of college sports in the city of Miami. From the time you first started, how have things changed? 

People accept the fact of what we are doing a lot more now. They are not as freaked out as they were at the beginning. At first it was, "you do football in Spanish? Jeez." Then people have listened and the feedback I have gotten has been really cool. 

I don't change; there are a lot of things that I do differently than other people. I use a lot of Spanglish. Having grown up on baseball, most of the stuff on baseball - most of the terminology - is in Spanglish. What is un honrun? In Spanish [radio] we use Spanglish constantly in baseball, which is what people are most used to. Un honrun, un hit, un ponche. When somebody says "ponche," it is a [strikeout]. We have come to accept it. 

It is very hard to do football unless you use Spanglish. There is no translation for quarterback. You cannot translate it. And I have been in Mexico many times and when I have worked there you hear "marical de campo," which pretty much means field general, but they are actually saying field marshal. To me it just doesn't jive. 

One thing that I hate is when they translate the names of the teams. Los acederos de Pittsburgh [The Pittsburgh Steelers]. I find it offensive. I found it offensive that they translated the Cleveland Browns to los Cafes de Cleveland. The Browns were named after a human being. You don't change the guy's name. 

The only name that I consistently would translate, believe it or not, was the Hurricanes when I did UM. With Hurricanes it was easy to say "Huracanes." It didn't faze me and it didn't faze people to hear it one way or another. The Golden Panthers are "the Golden Panthers." Sometimes I'll say "la pantera dorada," but it doesn't work.      

Q: You were the voice of UM football, baseball, and basketball for eight years. Why FIU and how did you get here?

Our [broadcast] contract was up. I used to get the rights and then take it to radio and that is basically how we make our money. [UM] has 7,500 [enrolled] students, pretty much, on a good day. The percentage of Hispanics is not very high. The alumni percentage [in Miami] is also not very high. Most of the [students] that graduate leave [and] go home, because they are not from here to begin with. 

Looking at FIU, 35,000 students - about 60 percent of those are Hispanic. Most of the alumni stay here and they are Hispanic. My audience is there. 

Up until now, FIU sports had really not made an impact, whether they had tried or hadn't, whatever; it just hasn't been a priority. Once they got football it was different. I saw that as an opportunity and that is why, for me, it was simple.

At [UM], I went as far as I could. I was blessed to have called two [College] World Series championships with the baseball team and a National Championship with the football team. I was thrilled. You cannot go out higher than calling [UM's] 2001 Rose Bowl. 

Q: You covered UM through National Championship games, a Gator Bowl and Sugar Bowls. As a person that was there through the thick and thin of a UM program that tried to reestablish itself and later dominated, what were the most important things that stuck out in your mind? How can that apply to what FIU is trying to do at the present time?

I think the most important thing that I saw at UM was when they hired Butch Davis. Butch was a workaholic and the guy just straightened it out so quickly. It was 180 degrees from the prior staff. They recruited incredibly in South Florida; what they used to call the State of Miami. 

I don't think that FIU can recruit on that level; it is a different monster. But I think that they have to follow that example. I think they are trying. We see that this year. They are doing a good job of that. 

That was the key for [Miami]: the discipline. Butch was a really neat guy to watch that change from the old Dennis Eriksson years to when Butch started there. The program was on a mission and you could see what their goals were. The players that they brought in - I can start to give you a list - all of those guys were terrific. I don't have one bad memory of a football player. Look at the NFL. 

The same thing [happened] with UM's baseball team. They brought in guys from around here and then selectively went out and brought in some studs. They had the benefit of everyone wanting to play there. 

I think FIU can be there. They have an advantage, they are a state institution. It doesn't cost $35,000 a year to go to FIU and that helps them. They need to take advantage of that and hopefully that will happen in the coming years as this program grows. 

Look for part two of this interview in the March 2 issue of The Beacon.

Headline: University online classes offers schedule flexibility
Author: Yalexa Leon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the busy lives that many students lead nowadays, online courses are becoming a popular means to continue an education.

For senior Paola Gonzalez, taking online classes has been a lifesaver. 

With a schedule that includes working 40 hours a week, maintaining a full-time class load would be nearly impossible if it wasn't for her psychology classes being offered on the net. 

"With online classes, I save myself the time it takes to get to school and I can study in my free time," Gonzalez said. "If it weren't for the freedom that online courses offer, I wouldn't be able to attend school full-time while working.  That also means it would have probably taken me a little longer to graduate."

Technology has allowed students to learn through videos, cassettes, movies, and now increasingly, through the Internet. This popular communication medium has opened a new market opportunity for students around the world and FIU is doing its part to keep up with the demand.

The innovative form of online courses is becoming so popular that FIU is expanding its online degree program, including a Bachelor's of International Business degree and a Bachelor's of Finance degree.

According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, during the 2001-2002 academic year, "56 percent of all 2-year and 4-year … degree-granting institutions offered distance education courses." An additional 12 percent indicate that they plan to offer distance courses within the next three years. 

Although an extra fee of $299 is charged, many students argue online courses offer a benefit that going to school might not - flexibility. 

"The practicality allowed me to dedicate myself to school when it was most suitable for me and for however long I wished," said sophomore Rennie Roopchan. "However, you have to be well-organized and have the motivation to control your laziness." 

 "FIU doesn't make any more profit from online courses than it does from regular classes," Online Services Associate Director Rey Morejon said.

Course Developer Chris Ellis said that around 10,000 students are enrolled in online courses at FIU this semester and the number is expected to increase. 

To some, there is a downfall to learning online. This was the case for junior Angela Morrelli who took an online accounting course.  Morrelli liked the opportunity to do things on her own time but thought the course might not have been worth the extra money.  

"I felt like I taught myself instead of having a professor teach me the material and I felt rushed with the timed exams and quizzes," Morrelli said. "I like to take my time when I take an exam."

Morrelli also admits that part of the reason for her bittersweet experience with online courses was probably her unfamiliarity with the subject of accounting. 

"You need to have the ability to self-teach and be able to meet deadlines," Roopchan said.

Over 18 fields of study already offer online courses at FIU.  FIU's "Gateway To Success" website, http://www.fiu.edu/gato, makes advising and tutoring just a few mouse clicks away.  

The informational website offers tips on improving study skills, faculty evaluations, instant essay feedback and tips on career choices.

Headline: Oscar Predictions
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are undoubtedly the biggest awards in the entertainment industry. 

Although the Oscars award films in line with classic Hollywood and films with mainstream appeal, and don't usually award the best films or the best performances, they remain the most prestigious because of their historical significance and value in an industry obsessed with awards. 

Winning an Oscar immediately brings fame, success and credibility to an actor or a film. Most of the nominees this year are smaller films that came and went quietly at the end of 2005. Thus, an award of this magnitude would be greatly beneficial to them. 

The 78th annual Academy Awards are scheduled to air March 5 on ABC at 8 p.m. The following are the predictions in the top categories:


Best Picture:

Brokeback Mountain

Capote

Crash

Good Night, and Good Luck

Munich


The Best Picture award is the most prestigious award of the night.  First, you can count out Capote and Good Night, and Good Luck which are too small to win the big prize.  Munich should win because it would show that the Academy has the guts to award a dark,  violent, and controversial film about terrorism. Best Picture is between Brokeback Mountain, a film that has won almost every single "best film" award since November, or Crash, a very well-loved film that has had a Cinderella-like boost in the last month.

Will Win: Brokeback Mountain

Should Win: Munich


Best Director:

George Clooney (Good Night, and Good Luck)

Paul Haggis (Crash)

Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain)

Bennett Miller (Capote)

Steven Spielberg (Munich)


Although the Oscars love actors-turned-directors, Clooney will have to sit this one out; Haggis will have to settle with the Screenplay award; Spielberg will have to remain satisfied with his two Oscars for now and I'm sure Miller is happy with his nomination. This award is Ang Lee's. He deserves it.

Will and Should Win: Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain)



Best Actor:

Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote)

Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow)

Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain)

Joaquin Phoenix (Walk The Line)

David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck)


In a weaker year, any of these fine actors would have won the award, but this year's Best Actor Oscar will go to Philip Seymour Hoffman for his incredible turn as Truman Capote. 

Will and Should Win: Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote)

Best Actress:

Judi Dench (Mrs. Henderson Presents)

Felicity Huffman (Transamerica)

Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice)

Charlize Theron (North Country)

Reese Witherspoon (Walk The Line)


This category's a no brainer. Reese Witherspoon wins this hands down. Why? Because she's won a lion's share of the "Best Actress" trophies awarded this year and this award will be no exception.

Will and Should Win: Reese Witherspoon (Walk The Line)


Best Supporting Actor:

George Clooney (Syriana)

Matt Dillon (Crash)

Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain)

Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Man)

William Hurt (A History of Violence)


Voters might go for Dillon or Gyllenhaal to reward the acting in their respective films, but they're most likely going to vote for Clooney, who's nominated in three categories, including Best Director and Best Screenplay (where he'll lose), or Giamatti, who won the Screen Actor's Guild and was snubbed two years straight for his performances in Sideways and American Splendor.		

Will Win: George Clooney (Syriana)

Should Win: Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Man)


Best Supporting Actress:

Amy Adams (Junebug)

Frances McDormand (North Country)

Catherine Keener (Capote)

Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener)

Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain)


Amy Adams could come from nowhere and snatch the Supporting Actress Oscar but this one is between Williams and Weisz, who steals the show as Ralph Fiennes's murdered political activist wife. 

Will and Should Win: Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener)


Best Original Screenplay;

Crash

Good Night, and Good Luck

Match Point

The Squid And The Whale

Syriana


Syriana is in the wrong category. The Squid and The Whale is too quirky and the message delivered in George Clooney's McCarthy-era film is too subtle compared to the sledgehammer that Crash is.

Will Win: Crash

Should Win: Good Night, and Good Luck


Best Adapted Screenplay:

Brokeback Mountain

Capote

The Constant Gardener

A History of Violence

Munich


If your film has won the Producer's Guild, Director's Guild and the Writer's Guild and is most likely going to win Best Picture and Best Director, there's no way you are losing Best Screenplay.

Will Win: Brokeback Mountain

Should Win: Munich



Best Animated Feature

Corpse Bride

Howl's Moving Castle

Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit


Wallace & Gromit, the funniest and best reviewed animated film of the year will win this. 

Will and Should Win: Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit

Headline: Dance Marathon offers 25-hour fun for hospital charity
Author: Maria Chercoles / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Dance Marathon 2006 - a 25-hour event consisting of non-stop dancing, games, giveaways, food and entertainment - will take place March 4 and 5 at the Pharmed Arena. Radio stations such as Y-100, Power 96 and 94.9 Mega will present this year's entertainment and guest appearances.

"DM is a very good experience because of the cause behind it. It's not work for me," graduate advisor Mariela Campuceno said. "Participants don't dance the whole night, there are many activities going on. Staying up is what matters."

The purpose of all this entertainment is to raise funds for the Miami Children's Hospital. According to Dance Marathon Coordinator Walter Maldonado, this year's Dance Marathon - or DM as it is commonly called - expects to raise between $50,000 and $70,000. Since its founding in 1997, DM has raised more than $315,000 for the Miami Children's Hospital.

"This year, we are expecting at least 200 dancers, moralers and volunteers," Maldonado said.

The event will open its doors March 4 at noon and will conclude March 5 at 1 p.m. 

"Other activities through the night include rock climbing, board games, movies, and guest appearances of Miami Heat Dancers,"  Campuceno said.

However, there are different levels of commitment for those who can't participate the full 25 hours. 

The dancers that participate in DM are expected to meet the highest level of dedication. They must raise $130 and stand the whole 25 hours of the event. Moralers, the DM dance and game organizers, must raise $150 and only work during assigned shifts; animating and motivating dancers. Five hour shifts are assigned to volunteers, who must raise $60, and to security staff, who must raise $50. 

"We still need many volunteers, and for those who just want to show up, $10 tickets will be sold at the door, which grant a five-hour access to the marathon," Maldonado said.

Although DM lasts 25 hours, it's a full-year event for organizers. Different fundraising and food drive activities are organized throughout the year. Also, marketing packages are sent to local businesses asking for tax-deductible donations.

However, DM 2006's total fundraising is not expected to surpass last year's $77,750.  

"This has been a hard year," Maldonado said. "With so many hurricanes hitting Miami, people are hesitant to make donations." 

However, this did not discourage Maldonado, who has participated in the event for more than five years. 

DM originated in State University in 1973 and was adopted by many universities nationwide. Today it takes place in more than 75 institutions, raising an overall $2 billion so far, and reaching 12 million children annually. The Children's Miracle Network (CMN), an organization that raises funds for more than 170 children hospitals nationwide, helps with the planning and implementation of local DMs. 

All proceeds from DM go to CMN's local hospital foundation - the Miami Children's Hospital - where funds are distributed among programs such as Health on Wheels and The Heart Center. 

Certain social events will take place before DM occurs, such as the Lip-Sync Contest on March 1 and the Dancer and Moraler Social, karaoke night and registration drive on March 2. 

Times and other information can be found at DM's website http://www.fiu.edu/~dm or by visiting the Center for Leadership Service in GC 2210.

Headline: Spring Break Destnations : Brazil
Subheadline: The party never stops in this Amazonian paradise
Author: Sarah Rodriguez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Although many students may genuinely be enjoying their classes and still have some of that focus they started with at the beginning of the semester, it's no secret that they also count down the days to spring break with great anticipation. 

One highly popular destination for those seeking to venture farther than usual is Brazil, whose Rio de Janeiro is famous for its spring break festivities. Located in the Southeast region of the country, Rio is called a city of vibrant music, delicious food and postcard quality beaches, even earning the nickname of Cidade de Maravilha, Marvelous City.

The first step in planning a vacation in this illustrious city is to book a roundtrip flight. According to research on expedia.com and orbitz.com, the average cost is around $900-$1,000 and keep in mind that the exchange rate in Brazil is 2.879 reales per dollar. 

Among many Rio hotels, two to consider would be the Portinari and the Copacabana Sul. The former, a four-star hotel with a sophisticated modern décor, begins at $100 per night. The second option, a three-star hotel popular for being within walking distance of Rio's downtown shopping spots, begins at $70. 

Once these logistics have been settled, the next choices are about the countless ways in which to spend one's time in Rio; for many tourists, soaking up sun in Rio's beaches is right at the top of that list. 

Even the city's locals - called Cariocas - rarely tire of the pristine beaches available - some of which are Copacabana, Ipanema and Barra. These are especially visited because they are close to some of the best shopping centers and most popular clubs in town. 

Like several other South American countries, Brazil is famous for its fine meats and choice of many restaurants - such as Marius, where seafood and barbecue are served; Porcao, whose focus is steak and barbecue; and Hotel Cipriani Restaurant, specializing in Italian cuisine. 

It is partly because of such restaurants that attractionguide.com says, "a great melting pot of the Brazilian culinary heritage finds its broadest expression in Rio."

After lounging on the beach and sampling Rio's best foods, one's stay there wouldn't be complete without some physically active and even adventurous sightseeing. Cable car tours travel 396 meters above Guanamara Bay and offer an impressive view of the appropriately named Sugarloaf Mountain, a definite must-see. 

Soccer fans can visit Maracana, the largest soccer stadium in the world, seating 120,000 people and often including entertainment from excellent samba bands. 

Another Rio highlight is the Christ the Redeemer Statue, with hands beautifully extended 710 meters atop Corcovado Mountain. It's considered one of the world's most visited monuments. 

Tijuca Rain Forest is unique for being the world's largest urban forest, replanted in the midst of the busy city as a conservational park. 

Lastly, what better place to hang glide or white water raft than over famous beaches and mountains, or in the river for which the city is named?

For those who thrive on the thrill of riding waves, or who'd like to experiment with them for the first time, the Brazilian island of Florianopolis may be even more enjoyable than Rio. 

Known as the surfing capital of South America, nexussurf.com says it combines "one of the world's most stunningly beautiful locations [and] one of the most incredible party scenes in the world." 

Without counting nearby islands, there are 42 beaches on Florianopolis alone, making it an ideal area for snorkeling, sailing, kite surfing, river rafting and wind surfing, as well as other less water-oriented sports like sand boarding, paragliding and hiking. 

Another advantage to Florianopolis is that- being the capital of Santa Catarina, one of the richest states in Brazil- it is a much safer area than Rio. 

Between these two spectacular South American locations, it seems that Brazil holds something for everyone, whatever their varied tastes might be. For a spring break full of exotic beaches, fine dining and memorable sightseeing, students interested should begin planning their Brazilian adventure right away. 


Look for this spring break series in the Life! section every Monday issue through March 6.
