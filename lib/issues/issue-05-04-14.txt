Headline: Baseball loses two of three to South Alabama
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After an 18-5 rout at the hands of FAU, a game in which FAU scored 16 runs in the second inning, the Golden Panthers continued their mediocre conference play, losing two of three games to the University of South Alabama, April 8-10 at the Baseball Stadium at University Park.

"I was real pleased with the effort this [series]," said Head Coach Danny Price. "We just got beat [allowing runs late in the game]."

FIU's season record is now 23-14 with a 4-5 record in Sun Belt Conference play. The series loss marks the second consecutive conference series in which FIU has lost two of the three games.

The Golden Panthers resume conference play with a three-game home stand against New Mexico State University, April 15 at 7 p.m.



South Alabama 8, FIU 7



The Golden Panthers blew a 7-1 lead with two outs in the eighth inning as a late grand slam swung momentum the Jaguars' way. South Alabama went on to score seven unanswered runs in the final inning and one-third.

FIU ace David Asher (6-0) pitched seven and two-third innings before being pulled after he allowed the grand slam. The senior lefty allowed five runs and eight hits, walked four batters and struck out five. 

Senior closer Danny Hernandez was saddled with his third loss of the season after South Alabama's tying and winning runs scored in the ninth. Both runs were unearned.

Junior Yahmed Yema went 3-for-4 with a double, three RBI and a run scored.

South Alabama struck right in the first inning after an RBI double to center field gave them a 1-0 lead.

FIU answered right back as it scored three runs in the bottom of the first inning. Redshirt junior Bryan Pullin and Junior Michael Lopez began with back-to-back singles. Yema hit a double to center field which scored Pullin. Redshirt junior Nick Cadena singled to left field and Lopez scored. Cadena proceeded to steal second base which allowed Yema to score from third on the throw to make it 3-1.

The Golden Panthers scored a run in both the second and fifth inning. They scored two more runs in the seventh inning off a sacrifice-fly by Lopez and an RBI single by Yema to make it 7-1.

 With two outs in the eighth, South Alabama cut the lead to two runs with a grand slam off Asher. Junior Frank Gonzalez got the final out of the inning for FIU.

In the ninth inning, South Alabama quickly scored on an RBI single to make it 7-6. The tying run scored on a play which featured two FIU throwing errors. The winning run scored off a double to left-center.



FIU 11, South Alabama 4



FIU bounced back from the disappointing loss off the bat of Yema and the arm of freshman starting pitcher Elih Villanueva.

"After losing [the previous] game, and it was a real heart breaker, to come back and fight today, it's real important," Price said. "We're fortunate to hang on there and get it done, but we have a long way to go."

Villanueva (6-2) got the victory, almost going the distance, as he pitched eight and two-third innings, allowed four runs, walked two batters and struck out seven.

"I struggled my last two times out," said Villanueva. "But I made a couple of adjustments, and I felt good today. I was more in the strike zone."

Yema led the way as he went 2-for-3 with two homeruns and five RBI. Cadena and junior Luis Rivera each added two hits and one RBI as FIU had 13 hits in the game.

The game was scoreless until Yema broke the silence in the bottom of the fourth inning with a two-run homerun to right field. The very next inning Yema struck again, this time with a two-out, three-run homerun to right field.

The Golden Panthers scored six runs in the seventh inning to make it 11-1. It was the seventh time this season FIU scored six runs in an inning.

The Jaguars added three runs in the final two innings.



South Alabama 12 FIU 7



Having 12 or more hits for the third consecutive game didn't help the Golden Panthers as South Alabama scored six runs in the 11th inning, blowing the game open and taking the win and the series.

"We battled back in the thing," Price said. "We tied the ballgame, went ahead, [but] it's just one of [the] conference [games]. They fought through it; we fought through it, but we just broke down there in the end."

Starting pitcher Ammer Cabrera struggled early and was replaced by Gonzalez after he pitched only one and two-third innings of work and allowed four runs (two earned).

Gonzalez pitched a career-high seven and one-third innings, allowed two unearned runs, struck out three batters and walked none for the no-decision.

Hernandez (1-4) received his second loss of the weekend as he pitched one and one-third innings, allowed four runs (three earned), one hit, walked one, hit two batters and struck out one.

The Golden Panthers came back from a 4-0 deficit and took the lead after they scored one run in the fourth, two runs in the fifth and three runs in the sixth.

South Alabama tied the game at six after a runner who reached base following a throwing error by Gonzalez came around to score on a sac fly. 

The very next batter hit a homerun to left field.

The game went into extra innings after being tied after nine. It wasn't until the eleventh that a team struck again. South Alabama struck hard as it took three FIU pitchers to get out of the Jaguars' six-run inning.

Freshman Corey Lozano hit a homerun in the bottom of the eleventh to make the final score 12-7.

Headline: Ore breaks records in sweep of UNT
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Assistant Sports Editor
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers swept North Texas during a four-game weekend series on April 9 and 10, and Tiffany Ore set two school records along the way. 

Ore struck out a school-record 17 batters in the second game of the doubleheader on April 9. 

She also struck out the first 12 batters she faced to break FIU's consecutive strikeouts record.

The four wins improve FIU's record to 26-16 overall, and they remain unbeaten in the Sun Belt Conference at 4-0 for the season.

The Golden Panthers will next play host to the defending conference champions No. 14, Louisiana-Lafayette in a pair of doubleheaders on April 16 and 17 at University Park.

April 9: FIU 5, North Texas 3

FIU took the first game of the doubleheader, as Jennifer Powell provided most of the scoring for the team.

Powell finished the game 3-for-4 with two runs scored and an RBI.

The Golden Panthers got out to a 2-0 lead in the first inning, when Powell scorched a double down the left field line to score Deomni Murray.

Powell later scored on an RBI double by Lindsay Tippings to make the score 3-0.

Amanda Nealer picked up the win and improved to 13-9 on the year. She was perfect through the first four innings, including striking out the side in both the third and the fourth innings. She gave up three runs, one earned, on five hits while striking out 10.

Kary Maxey (1-7) took the loss for NT, scattering five runs on eight hits while striking out two.

April 9: FIU 5, North Texas 0

In a record-setting performance, the Golden Panthers and Tiffany Ore continued their winning ways as they capped off the doubleheader with a shutout of the North Texas team. Ore's current record of  12 consecutive strikeouts breaks FIU's previous record of nine.

Ore finished the game with a complete game shutout, her second of the season. She gave up just two hits and improved to 7-5 for the year.

Kristina Fowler (5-10) took the loss for North Texas.

Powell, Witherow and freshman Brook Ruiz combined to produce the Golden Panthers' five runs to win the game.

Powell finished the game with two hits and an RBI, while Ruiz and Witherow drove in two runs each.

April 10: FIU 9, North Texas 2

The Golden Panthers, trailing 2-1 to the Mean Green, rallied for eight runs in the sixth inning to pick up the game's victory.

Tabitha Embry helped spark FIU's late scoring surge, as she finished the game 4-for-4 with three RBIs. 

Her teammate Brittany Witherow picked up three hits in four at bats and recorded two RBIs. 

Amanda Nealer pitched a complete game, giving up two runs on six hits while striking out five for her sixth straight win to improve to 14-9 on the season. 

Mandy Hacker (1-5) went five and one-third innings, surrendering eight runs on 11 hits for the Mean Green.

North Texas got on the scoreboard first when Danielle Rupp singled to left with one out and later scored on an RBI triple by Monica Garcia with two outs to give North Texas a 1-0 lead.

Held in check for most of the game, the Golden Panthers erupted for eight runs in the sixth to record the win.

Witherow provided FIU with its first lead on a two-run double, and the Golden Panthers never looked back. 

Embry capped off the scoring with a two-out bases loaded triple down the left field line to put FIU up by seven.

April 10: FIU 4, North Texas 1

FIU completed the sweep with its fourth consecutive win over North Texas. The win improved the team's winning streak to seven.

Tiffany Ore went the distance for the Golden Panthers, giving up one run on six hits to improve her record to 8-5. 

Kristina Fowler (5-11) went six innings for the Mean Green, scattering four runs on eight hits while striking out three.

After a rally from the Mean Green, the Golden Panthers finally put the game away on a solo home run by Jennifer Powell over the left field fence.

Headline: EDITORIAL - Higher voter turnouts would pressure SGA candidates to do their homework
Author: John Lovell, Managing Editor and C. Joel Marino, Senior Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The winners of the 2005 Student Government Association elections will begin the transition into their official positions in the next few weeks. Considering over 30,000 students attend both campuses, we were surprised at such a low voter turnout - 3,158 votes at University Park and 646 votes at Biscayne Bay (an improvement from last year's less than 100 student votes at BBC). Everyone is given the right to vote, and we are concerned that not enough students are taking the time to educate themselves and make a wise decision. 

With such low turnout numbers, we feel that most students are taking the outcome of the SGA elections for granted. More students should keep in mind that the president and vice president of SGA are given control of a large budget made up of funds which come out of our own tuition fees - approximately $7.2 million. 

Ultimately, it seems as though the choice of the people picked to handle such a great amount of money is made through 3,800 votes. A true and fair election should involve more student participation, which in turn would put additional pressure on the candidates to present legitimate and researched platforms. If candidates were forced to reach out and meet the demands of a larger, more active student body, election campaigns wouldn't just be a popularity contest.

In the end, despite the campaign blitz of flyers, debates and free food from the candidates and the university, it is up to the students to do their own research on candidates and platforms that will affect their years at FIU.

Headline: "SWEET!"
Subheadline: "NAPOLEON DYNAMITE" Breaks the trend
Author: Cristela Guerra / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"What are you going to do today, Napoleon?" 

"Whatever I feel like doing! Gosh!" 

It seems that our generation has a new role model to live up to. No, he isn't a politician or a model (I don't know how many would want to look like him), but the majority of those who have seen the movie "Napoleon Dynamite" will tell you it's become a new fad among trendsetters "to do what Napoleon does."  

As a housing resident and FIU student it's hard to even walk to class without hearing someone say "Gosh!" or "Idiot," two of the movie's popular catch phrases. What is ironic, however, is that this small-budget indie film is one of cleanest "teen movies" that's come out in a decade. Why is it that sex, booze and sick humor need to make up the majority of our generation's films?  

Some say movies imitate reality, but often it seems that society is the one imitating the scripts. Movies look for more sensational ways of giving people what they want, such as shocking them with a crude one-line quote or a quick flash of nudity, and it suffices for the moment. But as shown by Napoleon Dynamite himself, it's possible to have a complete pointless plot and still keep a smidgen of modesty in the process.

"Napoleon Dynamite" is in many ways the complete antithesis of most everyday teen films. Whether it be classics like "Road Trip" or it's more recent clone "Euro Trip", each of these films consist of the same plot in which the whole storyline revolves around this particular girl the protagonist is head over heals over. Like a fairy tale gone badly, "prince charming" has to climb over mountains and through incredibly cheesy and often gross situations to reach the perfect woman.  

It has the usual comic relief, the horny guy, the incredibly hot, semi-slutty sweetheart who wins our hero's heart, and a variety of sexual drug-filled shenanigans they get into on their quest. Perhaps they are looking to have sex ("American Pie") or maybe they are looking to restrain their desire for each other ("40 Days and 40 Nights"). Either way it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Hollywood is running out of ideas to stimulate minds.  

Instead they are counting on our voracious, insatiable hunger for bigger laughs and our increasing lack of self-control. Slowly but surely from the amount of nudity, sex and violence to parodies of drug use and sexual innuendo - it has all been done.  

Thus, it intrigued me that, for once, although its plot is a bit erratic, a film like "Napoleon Dynamite" came out and is just plain funny. The movie stars a tall, goofy fro-headed guy named Napoleon Dynamite who has a "different" way of looking at the world.  

Some scenes seem to be put in solely for a comedic effect, while others are so random, viewers might wonder what the point of the scene was. Napoleon's friend Pedro, dorky brother Kip, eccentric football-obsessed Uncle Rico, as well as quiet little town girl Deb (a long shot from the usual "girls gone wild" ladies we normally see) bring laughs while still keeping their clothes on.  

This multitude of unique and weird characters make this film fun, and the box office and DVD sales prove that, in this case, sex doesn't have to be prevalent to sell a movie. So then why does it seem so necessary to motivate young adults from 18-25 to view movies by including these bare necessities? 

Not to generalize - I realize there are many out there who prefer a dramatic plot and good-old fashion humor to the "soft porn" which usually promotes stupidity and assumes that all teenagers need to act accordingly when they are that age. Unfortunately, this is basically what we are telling the generations that come after us, in big bold headlines - a lie which has been breeding forever in society. This could be our only mark as we go on to be adults; it breeds a cycle of superficiality and shallowness. And we wonder why we are not taken seriously?

 I'm not saying movies need to constantly educate and contain a wise adage at the end (that's why we have educational television), but there is a difference between random, ridiculous humor and extreme images of recklessness and promiscuity which promote rash decisions and instant gratification without consequences. Are movies and reality TV really capturing a person's daily life? No. Neither does "Napoleon Dynamite" ... but at least it doesn't praise some of the worst aspects of our society as great accomplishments.

Headline: Students learn anatomy by dissecting human corpses
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
The two corpses lie on metal gurneys at the end of the room, both half-covered and in blue body bags. Their skin is leathery and peeled back, revealing the dried remains of sinews, organs and bones. One face is partially concealed. The other face is in plain sight, its eyes milky white, the mouth gaping wide and twisted slightly to the side.

Stored in a Health Life Sciences classroom at the University Park campus, the bodies are probed each week by students of various majors who take part in ZOO 3731L, the human anatomy course for the Biological Sciences Department.

"Yes, we do use cadavers, and students get to interact with them," said Ferdinand Gomez, coordinator for the anatomy demonstration labs. "It's a very hands-on type of class."

 According to Gomez, the department has been using donated bodies since the mid-1980s. FIU is one of the few universities in the state to allow undergraduate students to use cadavers.

  The University of Miami's School of Medicine supplies the dried and preserved corpses, which are a part of a donor program approved by the Florida Anatomical Board. 

Florida Funeral Homes deliver the bodies to FIU at a cost of $1,000 each. The funds for the bodies come from student lab fees and funds from the College of Arts and Sciences.

  "All the work is taken care of before the specimens arrive," Gomez said. "All we have to do is perform maintenance by spraying them with preserving fluid. The students take care of that, and it helps prevent mold or excessive drying."

Though the lab once made use of 10 to 12 bodies per semester, Gomez says the classes now make do with only two to five bodies per calendar year, because requirements for biology changed and various specimens were no longer needed.

"The [human anatomy and survey of regional anatomy] classes that use the cadavers share [the bodies], and they last throughout the year," said Gomez.

The fact that there are corpses on campus - however, few - has made students nervous.

 "I've always heard that there was a morgue at UP and that they kept frozen bodies," said junior Dan Streiden. "I don't know if that's just a rumor or not, but if they do have a morgue, that can't possibly be sanitary."

Gomez believes the rumors are fueled by misunderstandings among students and by campus gossip.

"There are probably many misconceptions about what goes on in here," said Gomez. "This isn't like an autopsy room where the bodies are still fresh. The specimens have been embalmed beforehand and don't even look real anymore."

 Students who are currently taking the class admit that they too were initially scared by the prospect of handling corpses.

"Before I got into the class, I knew that this was going to be very different from anything I was used to," said senior Adam Leisy, who is majoring in biology. "I had dissected cats before, but a human corpse was a totally new ballgame."

Though students are told that the class will involve interaction with corpses before signing up, some still felt nervous about what they would encounter.

"Before I saw the body, I was freaked out. I had images of horror movies in my head and didn't know what to expect," said Brenda Piantini, a sophomore majoring in nursing.

 However, the students stated that after a semester of working with the bodies, all negative reactions faded, and they became comfortable with the idea of handling human remains.

 "I think at this point in the semester, our class, including myself, [has] become a little more desensitized to the fact that we are working on human bodies. There isn't the same hesitation that I noticed before, and people are more casual around them," said Leisy, who nicknamed one of the subjects "Apollo."

Though most of the students in the class are studying science or medicine related fields, Gomez encourages students from all majors to take part in the course if they are interested in enhancing their learning experience.

 "We are all essentially made of the same things - skin, muscle, organs, bones. This class shows us this and how we can appreciate what we're made of and who we are as people," he said.

&nbsp;
FIU's Model United Nations team returned from the National Model United Nations Conference in New York with awards for the 13th year in a row.

An "Outstanding Delegation" first place award for excellence in position papers and a "Distinguished Delegation" second place award for performance were awarded to the team. This marks the fifth consecutive year the team has received an "Outstanding Delegation" award.

FIU's delegation represented Estonia at the conference.

The UN competition is one of the oldest and most prestigious for college students, having been created by the UN in the late 1940s. More than 3,500 college students from 150 universities from the United States, Europe, Africa, South America and Asia participated, according to Jeanne Kates, political science instructor and director for FIU's MUN program. 

 "I am particularly proud of the position papers award because, to me, that represents a high degree of academic achievement," said Kates.

 Model United Nations (INR 4926) is a three-credit course offered each Spring semester by the Department of Political Science in conjunction with FIU's Jack D. Gordon Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship Studies.

Headline: Classical female counterparts
Author: Yahnilet Colon / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The spirits of great pianists and composers like Chopin, Mozart and Liszt shared in the appreciation of the music of their less-acknowledged female contemporaries at the Women Composers & Song Transcriptions Concert, held April 9 at the Wertheim Performing Arts Center Concert Hall on the University Park campus.

The night was filled with piano music as students from the FIU School of Music Piano Department brought to life the works of various composers, primarily women of the 18 - 21 centuries.

The audience was transported through the different eras of piano composition. The classical style associated with notable composers such as Mozart and Beethoven in this concert represented the work of blind pianist and composer, Maria Theresia von Paradis. Along with von Paradis, other composers through the Romantic Era linked with such famous names like Franz Liszt, as well as the contemporary sounds of living performers like Valerie Capers, who overcame various obstacles as a blind African-American composer, were noted in the concert,

The program's variety and focus on women, was of great importance to Jose R. Lopez, coordinator for keyboard studies.

"It's important to showcase composers that should be known," said Lopez, noting that often the influence these women may have exerted on their male counterparts continues to be overlooked. 

Variety was Lopez's objective and he chose the compositions and transcriptions for the night's performances accordingly. Composition, speed of the pieces and contrast between style were among the top interests cited by Lopez in his decision process. 

"We hope it's not the only concert, because there are a lot of women composers out there that need to be heard," Lopez said.

In listening to the work of Marianna von Martinez, who actually shared a piano bench and keyboard with Mozart, the link to the 18th century was obvious. With its classical upbeat notes, Martinez's work certainly contains the influence of Mozart, but through their constant interaction, the possibility of influence flowing in both directions is certainly a strong one.

In addition to the sharp, quick-paced sounds of the classical era, students performed pieces by women of the Romantic Era such as Clara Wieck Schumann, a woman known as much for her incredible musical talents as for her courtroom struggles to overcome her father's disapproval of marrying composer Robert Schumann.

 Wieck's work, often laced with secret messages to Schumann, is representative of the era with its emotional, almost melancholic undercurrents.Audience members were captivated as students in the FIU Piano Program played music seamlessly flowing from one era to another.

"I like the performance; I love piano," said freshman Karen Argenal, who is majoring in music education and aspires to become a professional piano player and teacher.

Fellow attendee, Jorge Diaz, a freshman majoring in piano performance, agreed. 

"[There] is a great level of virtuosity; [they're] very skilled," said Diaz, who hopes to participate in next fall's performance.

There were a few surprises, such as the students performances of contemporary pieces. Aside from the composers' various ethnic backgrounds and influences through different eras, contemporary composers also introduced a new technique in which the piano player utilizes more than just the keyboard.

"[Pianists are] using the piano as a percussion instrument, using the piano strings in the cage of the piano to create different sounds," said Heledys Rodriguez, a graduate student majoring in production management. It was certainly a surprising spectacle as pianists Daniel Carrascal and Danica Borisavljevic alternated between running their hands over the keyboard and reaching into the cage of the piano. The concert ended with the work of Fanny Mendelssohn, whose early lieders were published under her brother's name due to the ideologies of women being kept within the home's private realm. 

The dramatic tone of her work, "Das Jahr: November," brought the audience through the dark, but ultimately triumphant musical notes of her piece. The audience murmured its approval with a moment of silence after the final applause of the night.

Headline: The new Queen of Hip-Hop
Author: Jarrod Miller-Dean / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
For all of those club-heads  who hunger for the dirty southern sound, Ms. Kra-Z just might satisfy your needs. Her latest single, "Cut Em' Down," has been receiving massive radio airplay and has been tearing up clubs from Memphis to Houston. So, grab a bottle of Alaze and your favorite pimp cup and prepare to get crunked.

"Cut Em' Down" is the newest single from Ms. Kra-Z's debut album, Lyrically Insane (Setting the Pace Productions; 2005). 

The single begins similar to the average southern club track, with its three-chord, multi-layered sequence and heavy bass line. It can easily be ignored and classified as "the same old thing," if not for a bouncing spring in the background. The sound draws the ear closer to the song. 

Played on a home stereo, you find yourself deciphering the beat more than listening to the lyrics of the track.

In the hip-hop industry, female rappers are often considered insignificant. They usually have to use their physical attributes to get noticed, as opposed to using their lyrics. A phat butt and a pretty face can only get you so far.  Lil' Kim found that out the hard way.  She originally came out as a real contender, but the jet-set life of being a celebrity has jaded her. 

What makes Ms. Kra-Z interesting is her unapologetic hard rhymes. They are not complex by any means, but are edgy in their delivery. She comes off tougher than the average female rapper.  

Instead of making a sexually exploitative track  like artists such as Trina or Jackie-O, Ms. Kra-Z spits in the mic that she will shut down any and all of those that oppose her.

"Any Chicken that get in the way of this queen/ gonna get her ass thrown straight into the ring/ in the first round the strangest things start happening"

"Cut Em' Down," also features Fiend, who is known for releasing slews of CDs, including 2000's, Can I burn? and his side-project with the 36 Mafia known as Da' HeadBussaz. 

Though he doesn't bring anything special to the song, because he sounds like a generic hype-man, he works well for the hook. 

You can envision him running around on the stage, spilling his cup of Hennessey and yelling at fans to get wild.

"You think your click big?/We gonna cut em' down" 

Originally born in Memphis, TN, Ms. Kra-Z got her first taste of hip-hop from the 901 Thugs.  Ms. Kra-Z recently scored her own solo deal with the Memphis-based record label, Setting the Pace Productions.

The small label features Ms. Kra-Z and the unknown, Dormus. Though still experienced, the label promises to make a name for itself in southern rap.

It is uncertain if Ms. Kra-Z will rise above mediocrity. In a scene where artists like UGK, Little John, 8-Ball and MJG rule as kings, for a new artist to get any notoriety, they need to bring something new to the table.  

If she stays sharp, she may just make it.

 While still being considered "young" to the game, Ms. Kra-Z has a tough female rapper. She needs to embrace and develop it, otherwise she will be pawed off as just another "novelty female rap act." 

Ms. Kra-Z may not be able to rhyme like Foxy Brown or Remy Martin, but with a little work, she could pick up where 36 Mafia's Gangsta' Boo left off.

Headline: EMBRACE the banality
Subheadline: British band's style, nothing new to the U.S.
Author: Jessica Iser / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I'm a fan of British rock. From The Beatles to The Smiths, Oasis, Muse and even Coldplay - I love it all. That's why I was surprised to realize that I don't particularly like Embrace. 

The British quintet consists of brothers Danny McNamara and Richard McNamara on lead vocals and lead guitar respectively, Steve Firth on bass, Mick Dale on the keyboard and Mike Heaton on drums. 

The group came together at the height of British pop in the mid-90s and has since come out with five albums - Out of Nothing being their latest effort. 

After listening to the whole album about 12 times, I can honestly say that it is nothing special. 

In fact, Out of Nothing reminds me of another famous British rock band's work - Coldplay's. This is no surprise because Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin actually wrote the lyrics to the song "Gravity," the second track on the album. Even though Martin is only credited with writing that one song, his influence can be heard everywhere on the album. 

There is no real high point on Out of Nothing. The song "Ashes," a lukewarm rock anthem, starts off the album. Once the song's chorus kicks in and the choir (yes, choir) starts singing, it's just about as much cheesiness as I can take. But I forged on thinking that the rest of the album could't be as sappy. 

I was wrong. Every track on the album sounds like the last. Almost every song on Out of Nothing includes orchestral arrangements, power chords and sappy sounding lyrics that, when listened to closely, don't make much sense. 

The only song that truly stands out on the album is "Near Life." The only reason it stands out is because this track is uncharacteristically bleak and dark, a departure from the overall optimistic tone the album has. 

Danny McNamara's voice switches from emotional to apathetic for "Near Life," and off-beat, echoing guitar riffs give the song, and album, a much-needed change in tone. 

All in all, I felt the change came too late. Out of Nothing lacked variety, character and originality.
