Headline: 'Tally Rally' protest needs student support to be succesful
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Student Government Association will once again sponsor a trip to the state capitol and rally for the funding of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship Program in the upcoming "Tally Rally." With the same premise as last year's trek to Tallahassee, students will be provided with free transportation to and from the rally where several other schools will also be protesting cuts in state-funded scholarships for graduating high school seniors. Student government has taken the commendable initiative to protect the Bright Futures scholarships, but student support of the rally is absolutely necessary to its success.

What lies in the balance? Bright Futures scholarships are provided to Florida residents who achieve at least a 3.0 GPA and combined 970 SAT score. 

It provides for either 75 percent or 100 percent of a student's public university tuition, regardless of yearly tuition fluctuations, for graduating high school seniors who decide to remain in the state for their education. 

There are currently 98,000 students on the lottery-funded program in the state.

That cost is seen by law-makers as too heavy a price for the state to bear, so they have been searching for a means to minimize how much money goes into the program; potential solutions include raising the requirements for eligibility or locking in the amount of compensation at a percentage of this year's tuition, leaving students to pay the difference as tuition costs mount.

Last year, the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses came together at the Old Capitol Building en masse, in a last minute outcry against budget cuts. Led by former UP-SGC president Jessica Morffi and BBC-SGC president Adrian Carter, more than 100 FIU students joined 500 other Florida universities to keep the state from balancing "the budget on the backs of Florida students." 

Nearly 25,000 petitions were also signed by students across the state and presented to the governor as further proof of student support from those who couldn't make it to the rally. 

This is kind of student support is indispensable. 

Despite last year's efforts, the program is still at stake, and students must make their need for this program known. There are approximately 201 spaces available on the buses bound for Tallahassee. 

It is imperative in the battle to keep Bright Futures strong that not one of those seats be left empty.

Marriage is all about love


To the Editor:


The purpose of marriage is not to raise a family. Many people get married to raise families because in the Bible it is a "sin" to do so out of wedlock, so they get married to have their 10,000 babies. 

However, many other people simply get married to be with their loved one and are disgusted with the idea of having kids. 

I know many people who want to get married but do not want children and people who have done so - so Mallo's claim that marriage's true 
purpose is to start a family is ridiculous. 

And in that case, if it was - what if a man and a woman found out they couldn't have a family? Is their marriage somehow deemed less of a marriage? Is it better than that man and woman with four children? Is it worse that they adopted instead of having their own children? So if "marriage is to raise a family," why not have a homosexual couple [who was married] adopt? Then they are raising a family just like other couples. Do you know how many unwanted children there are out there? 

Having babies seems like a selfish choice when you think of it. 

So a gay marriage is the same as a straight marriage because they too can raise a family just like anyone else. They are not less capable than anyone else. Most American's do not disagree with homosexuality just because you do. 

Being gay doesn't limit anything Mr. Mallo. That is so ridiculous. Some of my most successful friends are gay. Why can't they have a normal life just like anyone else? Because they are gay they are not normal? 

Please. 

If they fall in love with someone and want to get married, they should be allowed to - and that is that. Sex has nothing to do with it. And that is the way it is.

"Reparations: A Dumb and Dangerous Idea" lecture reported one-sidedly


To the Editor:


We are writing concerning the frontpage article that appeared in The Beacon March 1, entitled "Reparations A Dumb and Dangerous Idea." 

The article, in our opinion, amounted to a somewhat one-sided portrayal of the event in question. Firstly and fundamentally the article fails to capture how explosively charged and contentional the debate proved to be.  

The article, while capturing much of the points Murdock makes in his presentation, does little to capture any of the rich and lengthy dialogue that followed afterward.Murdock's presentation was only 30 minutes while the question and answer period was a good hour and a half.

Some of the points brought up in the Q &A session were that there did indeed exist a precedent for reparations being granted to the descendents of a wronged party (as opposed to directly to the wronged party itself); as in specifically the case of the Native American Indians. It was suggested that that this group be used as a prime example of how descendents could possibly benefit from reparations. 

Additionally, it was pointed out that an improved public educational and welfare system would benefit poor Americans in general and not mainly blacks, who do not constitute a majority of the poor in American society (contrary to popular opinion). Therefore, pumping money into the welfare system as a whole should not be viewed as analogous to reparations for blacks.

For one thing, the majority of people in the United States. who benefit from welfare are not blacks. (This in itself is a dumb and dangerous misconception so far as we are concerned).

Commendations should be given to the various student groups involved in organizing a debate on such an emotionally charged issue. 

We should be open to the view however, that there are invariably at least two different perspectives on just about any issue. 

In the case of the reparations forum, varying points of view were openly and clearly expressed in what was probably the liveliest and most heated debate on campus in a long while. And this is essentially where the article run by The Beacon falls flat.  

By not reflecting the wide spectrum of views that were aired during the event, it effectively misrepresented the forum.

Headline: In Response: 'I grew up with two moms'
Author: Fernanda Foerter/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
In an article published by Indra Bosko regarding gay marriage on March 8, several important point of views regarding this debate were left out and ought to be addressed by your paper.

The article begins outlining a very stereotypical view of the basis for the argument: religion vs. sinful gay people. 

I, instead, will offer a different set of arguments against gay marriage I believe is more objective.

The first problem with this article is that it sets a tone for those against gay marriage as religious people following their faith and what they believe to be sinful. It quotes two Christian student on of whom quotes from the Bible of the sinful nature of homosexuals. Nowhere after, does the article present other opinions, not based on religion, for why others believe gay marriage is not good for society, whether it's necessary or what to even call them gay unions.

The definition, purpose, intent and spirit of the law for marriages has been for ages that one man and one woman unite as a union. The spirit of this law is really a privilege. 

Our society has identified that the best way for children to grow up is with a mom and a dad together in marriage. The intent of this privilege is to encourage the union and stability of one man and one woman for the purpose of raising children.

There is nothing stopping anyone today from cohabitating and having children or not. 

There is nothing stopping me or you from living together, eating together, having children or getting a dog.

This is your right: to live with whomever you wish, be it Mom, Dad, Bob, Janet or Fluffy. 

But marriage is not a right. It's a privilege, and one given to promote stability in the home. Now granted, with 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce today, many people have ignored this fact and think that because they can, they will marry or divorce as many times as they wish. So the tax breaks married people get - insurance price breaks for families, car insurance premium discounts for married people, etc - are all privileges. Gay marriage threatens these privileges given to heterosexual families because companies will simply be unable to afford them.

What about children? 

If gay marriages are legitimized, then certainly there will be adoptions. There has been study after study stating that only a union between a man and woman is the most stable for children. But I can already hear protests of people reading this citing alcohol, drug and physical abuse existing in heterosexual homes, and these will also exist in homosexual homes. But assuming people are otherwise normal and love each other; children do best in heterosexual homes, end of story. You can't argue scientific fact.

So what problems would children growing up in a loving homosexual home have? 

Well, there are studies on that also! The University of South Carolina published a study of children growing up in gay homes and found them to have sexual identity issues where boys were more effeminate and girls more masculine and both to be more sexually promiscuous during their teenage years.

In fact, I'm part of these statistics. I grew up with two moms. I come from a gay household, and I was always the tom-boy, I can change my own car brakes, oil and tires, I know how to throw a football, play soccer and bat a baseball. I have no clue how to put on make-up and can never decide on how to style my hair and you often see me with a bun. 

Both of my moms weren't "butch" as some may call it. My birth mom dressed very femininely to work, put on make up and styled her hair every morning.

I was picked on at school for being a tom-boy, and picked on in the 
playground for having two moms. But I'll never tell my moms  this. I had a horrible time relating to other girls and I still know how to play with Barbies. I was never sure how to behave and boys' behaviors where all so curious to me. 

I'm happily married today, with my own daughter. So this may disprove the myth that "gayness" is somehow learned or rubbed off. Do I wish my mom had raised me without her partner and been a single mom? Unconditionally, yes.  I really believed I would have fared better growing up.

One other problem with the article is the idea that denying gays the privilege to marry somehow denies their rights like blacks were once denied the rights to marry, vote, etc. This comparison offends me in so many ways. There are no rights being denied to gays. It is ludicrous to even make such a comparison. Gays aren't being forced to work on plantations, being beaten with whips, aren't considered ¼ of a person, aren't banned from voting and certainly aren't being pulled over by cops on suspicion of "gayness" alone. Comparing gay marriage to the Civil Rights movement is arrogant and far from the truth.

There are a few quotes that bother me even more. One of them asks to be "recognized as other relationships are recognized."  What other relationships? This is another slippery slope.  Heterosexual relationships are the only ones recognized by law, but if gay marriages are recognized, what of polygamy? Incest?  Age of consent?  These people believe their relationships are just as legitimate!  Just ask NAMBLA.

Denying gay marriage does not deny gays "the pursuit of happiness." If you think marriage causes happiness, ask the other 50 percent of heterosexuals who thought otherwise. If gays think that marriage will bring them happiness, then they miss the point of marriage. Marriage is a contract that is legal and religious for some. 

I was just as happy living with my current husband before we married.  Marriage for us meant we wanted to start a family and that this was to be a serious step, not just playing house together.

If you didn't already noticed, I'm opposed to gay marriage. Not for religious reasons, but for historical, psychological and customary ones. This does not on the other hand make me "anti-gay" because I would have to hate my mother for her choices and I don't. If gays want to get married, fine, but make it another category and call it something else.

Headline: FIU students need to vote, be involved
Author: Ty Wright/Guest Columnist
&nbsp;
There are two kinds of people who exist in this world, those who make things happen and all of the rest. 

The people who make things happen get involved, promote success and encourage others to do the same. 

The rest dwell in negativity, put forth zero to little effort to change their perception of the situation that surrounds them and criticizes. 

That outlook is present on campus here at FIU and it is reflected by the lack of involvement from a portion of students, which is further reflected in the ratio of voters to the can't-be-bothered voters. Not to eclipse the nationwide election now in progress, but incase you were uninformed, an election is about to erupt right here on campus and we should be relieved that our university does not determine the trend of voters in America. 

Out of the increasing enrollment of 34,000 FIU students, a meager 7.5 percent managed to utilize their time to exercise their vote in the student government elections of 2003. 

That is approximately 4,500 students who took the initiative to get involved. 

The quantity from 2003 is still a great improvement from the previous year, with nearly less than half of 2003's percentage. 

So why is there a nonchalant attitude toward voting at FIU? The students who I have conversed with believe just as the democratic votes of the 2000 Presidential election, their votes will not make a difference. The difference between the Presidential election and the Student Government Election is that there was a genuine effort was made by the voters of 2000 to get involved. Some students are simply unaware of the election process, its purpose and existence. 

The election process is fairly straightforward and accessibly allows the students to partake in one of two methods. 

The first method is to become a candidate of the student government elections. If the first method does not appeal to you, maybe the second might be a bit more realistic. 

Find a candidate who represents your principles and vote for them on April 6 or 7. Now, if you think that you can use the excuse that you do not have an idea who the candidates are, then open your eyes to witness a major presence after spring break toward April. 

You know the people who try to get your attention as you dodge your way through the campus? Some of those people are candidates and want to promote your interest. 

You can even discover more about the candidates at events such as the "Know Your Vote" and "Meet the Candidates" and "Candidates Debate" March 29 and 31 in the GC Pit. 

If you need another reason to get involved in your school as a student other than ownership and management, how about some insight on some accomplishments of the current council thus far? 

The new student ID numbers that are presently being implemented, 24 hour study areas that has benefited numerous students throughout the school year and the initiation of the housing Shuttle Bus program are just a few of the SGA's many accomplishments. 

If you still need additional incentive concerning the significance of your involvement in the Student Government elections, bare in mind that there is a definite strength in numbers, both influentially and financially. 

The SGA is accountable for utilizing a bulky budget in the sum of 7.1 million dollars in the interest of the students. 

For the students who recently paid the increased tuition rate of this academic year, wouldn't you want a voice in how some of your money is being consumed? 

Know the issues, know your candidates, contribute to your school and community. 

Vote!

Headline: Students flock to capital to save Bright Futures Scholarship
Author: Ty Wright/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Student government's Government Relations Committee is looking for students to help preserve the Bright Futures Scholarship Program as they take their message to the capitol's steps March 17, when the legislature begins examining the state's budget for the 2004 fiscal year.

Students who want to make the ride to Tallahassee at no cost can sign up for a spot on one of four chartered buses at GC 311. All that's required is to fill out an information packet, which includes a liability waiver. Student government is also asking professors to excuse students who attend the rally.

Buses will leave from University Park at midnight March 16. Organizers are asking students to show up between 10 and 10:30 p.m. in front of the bookstore. Biscayne Bay Campus students are asked to meet in front the library at 11:30 p.m. Buses are expected to leave that campus between midnight and 1 a.m.

Student government will   take approximately 201 students to Tallahassee to help convince the legislators that these scholarship programs are essential and should not be cut or changed.

"In regards to continuing my higher education it was a make or break program and it really made a difference," said Jorge Rosario, a member of the Government Relations Committee.

Students also fear that if the Bright Futures Scholarship is kept, legislators will not fund the program adequately enough to keep up with tuition increases.

The scholarship currently fulfills 75 or 100 percent of an awarded student's tuition, even if there is a tuition hike. But the current proposal will not take into account tuition increases, leaving the student to pay for the balance.

Another proposed change would be to make Bright Futures a need-based scholarship. 

The Florida Lottery-funded scholarship is currently available to any Florida resident who has at least a 3.0 weighted GPA and a combined 970 SAT score.

"It's what helps the tuition stay low in this state. [Florida legislators] want to make it more like financial aid," said Rosario, who is also a Bright Futures Scholarship recipient.

An additional aspect for alarm is the rewiring of academic requirements. Presumably, a higher SAT score will be imposed for the scholarship, which may hinder potential minority candidates based on the biases of standardized testing. 

"It's the brain-drain effect.  It hurts the future of our communities, people and jobs in Florida," said Justin Fahringer, a member of the Governmental Relations Committee. "This program is essential to keeping Florida's best and brightest to stay here."

The committee pleads with students to not wait until the Bright Futures Scholarship Program is gone to start saving it.

"All students of higher education in the state of Florida are rallying together under one voice to tell the legislators in Tallahassee they want to maintain access to a quality education in the state of Florida," Fahringer said.

Headline: Spring Break Redefined
Subheadline: VOC's Alternative Spring Breakers tackle nationwide issues head-on
Author: Albert Del Toral/ Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As part of the Alternative Spring Break program, an estimated 100 FIU students will spend their breaks tackling community concerns head-on from March 20-28. These issues range from hunger, poverty, and homelessness, to the environment, HIV and AIDS, and helping terminally-ill children.  

FIU students have volunteered to work on the week-long projects in various global locales annually since 1995, when the program was founded locally as part of the Volunteer Action Center. The students have registered more than 4,000 community service hours and have worked in 20 different states.

FIU students have also been featured on "48 Hours" for their 2002 work at Ground Zero in New York. The university is the only one among the 200 others involved in Alternative Spring Break to form its own alumni association.  

Danielle Nied, director of the FIU chapter, said "the students go through an application process and have to work on their issue for at least a day with the local community before they even get selected.

"Then, once chosen, the year's participants are broken into groups of 12, assigned their site leaders, and put through team-building exercises as part of their preparation."  

Exercises include rock climbing and the ropes course, a team building activity FIU offers participants. It is the only university in the nation to offer this challenge. 

Once the day arrives to depart, the groups gather into 12-passenger Thrifty vans and head out to their destinations. 

Upon arrival, they spend their weekdays, from 9 a.m.-5 p.m., working in ways beneficial to their assigned cause. The groups then head back to their shelters once the workday has finished only to begin planning the next day's affairs. 

Throughout the week, all volunteers read at least three educational articles about the issue that they are working in hopes of becoming better informed. After returning home, the project workers reunite with their groups one last time to work on a post-service project.  

As FIU junior Jacqui Sosa prepares to embark on her third outing with the program, this year's Orlando site leader admits that "every time [she has] done it, it has just made [her] want to return all that much more the next year. It's been nothing but a positive and great experience."  

The Break Away organization hopes the program will help propel the workers into future involvement within their own communities, even after the alternative break ends.

In 1997, the FIU chapter earned the Program of the Year Award from the national association. In 2003, it also garnered the Outstanding Service Award. As one of the leading schools chartering this national program during the past nine years, FIU has been honored with hosting the 2004 ABC's, Break Away's week-long conference held later in the year to recap the overall achievements of the year and to discuss ideas 
as to how they can better their results for the upcoming years. 

These recognitions are just secondary, what's important is knowing that they have touched the lives of so many people. 

Kelly Brylie, who worked as a Spring Breaker at the New York site last year, said: "What [she loves] the most about it is that it lets you connect with people.  It is definitely more than what some people may consider it.  You do more than just stand there and handout a bunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  You change lives, make new friends, and get a huge sense of accomplishment."

Also looking forward to this year's project is freshman Alfonso Leon, one of the few participants who will be in a group traveling by airplane. His flight will land in Panama City where he will help children.  

This year, 30,000 students will be trading the sand and the clubs for homeless shelters, hospitals, and other such places. They will be leaving their significant others behind to help complete strangers.

Headline: Student musician set to perform on campus
Author: Cyntianna Ledesma/Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
If you've seen a small girl who walks around campus wearing white boards that promote herself, then you've already met Elisa Melendez. Melendez, a Liberal Arts major, may seem like a regular college freshman, but within her, she is hiding big talent.

Before moving to Miami at the age of 12, Melendez was born and raised in Puerto Rico. It wasn't long after her move to Miami, that she discovered she had a gift for writing songs. She took a few guitar lessons, and though she did not know much about the guitar, she would write lyrics and melodies and some guitar parts.

In 2001, Melendez met her lead guitarist and first member of her backup band, Evan Lamb. With a more experienced guitarist now at hand, she decided to focus more of her time on writing the lyrics and melodies, and let Lamb write the guitar pieces.

In early February, Melendez performed at the bookstore on the University Park campus. She got the gig, by walking into the bookstore one day and asking the manager if he'd like to have a live performance. The manager called her back shortly thereafter and said he would be delighted to have her perform.

"That was just a one time thing though," says Melendez, "because there is a lot of wear and tear on the instruments, and the bookstore didn't offer any compensation."

You may have also caught Melendez's performance at FIU's own Battle of the Bands event which happened recently in the housing quad. Her backup band now includes a rhythm guitarist, a bass player, drummer, and occasionally a piano player.

"That was the first time I performed with a full band," says the singer. "It was the most exciting feeling I've ever had, to know exactly what my songs could be."

She describes her music as pop/rock, but with some experience in musical theater, says she performs just about anything. If you go to one of her shows you'll hear many rock covers as well as original music.

It won't be the last time FIU gets to see her, though. She plans to perform at a few of the GSA Gradskellers and at the Dance Marathon in The Pit on April 3 at 8 p.m. And, if you don't catch her at FIU, she will also be at the Starbucks coffee shop on 11515 South Dixie Hwy on April 23 at 8 p.m.

At the moment, Melendez and the band are polishing up a four-song demo in the University of Miami recording studio. They have plans to search for a record deal as soon as the demo is done.

Melendez has a small piece of advice for aspiring musicians and that is, "you cannot be shy in this business. You have to do everything you can to make sure people come to see you."

Headline: The dirty side of college
Subheadline: Uncleanliness rules in student housing
Author: Jon Banke/Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"What is that awful smell?" "Why is the floor so sticky?" And of course the ever popular, "Is that vomit?" Believe it or not, these three questions get asked in college dorms and apartments all across America every single day. 

If you have never lived on campus, take it from me, messy dorms are a part of college life. Having lived for three years now on campus, I can attest that the most filthy, disgusting, and vile places that I have ever come across in my 21 years have been some of the college dorms I have happened to visit. 

After the first week or two of school I was pretty much used to it. Nowadays, I am so conditioned toward all the sights, sounds, and smells of a college apartment that almost nothing will ever surprise, shock, or even sicken me. As normal as it may seem now, those first few weeks in the dorms opened my eyes as well as my nose to the true sights and smells of college.

 A few years ago, some of the first friends I made at school happened to be a couple of soccer players who lived in my building. They were my first experience with how messy college students can really be. When I first opened the door to their apartment, I found the entrance blocked by eight or nine full, black garbage bags. I think I remember a few of them leaking. 

I thought maybe that was a little strange, but I shrugged it off seeing by their lack of a reaction none of the four or five people in the living room seemed to think so. I walked into my friend's bedroom to say hello and could not see the floor. It was completely covered in garbage, old food wrappers, shavings from a hamster cage turned upside down, and both clean and dirty clothes. Their floor remained so sloppy that I never knew they had a rug in their bedroom until the end of November. My roommates and I have done our best to keep incidents like this from happening in our dorm. Of course, as with most college apartments, those efforts have gone on in vain. For the first few weeks of each semester we are usually right on task, keeping things so clean you could have eaten prime rib right off of our floor. A direct correlation exists between the cleanliness of our apartment and how far we are into each semester. In the fall, for instance, comes the World Series, and in October our place is so filthy the fire marshal would not be out of line if he had it condemned. By Thanksgiving, a gas mask or a chemical suit is not just the norm, its encouraged. Piles of dirty dishes, bags full of trash, and spoiled food build up throughout the apartment. 

Earlier in the afternoon, as I was contemplating this column, I was inspired to do a little bit of cleaning. I was led to the refrigerator to try to get some things done. I threw out four cartons of expired milk, three cans of old spaghetti sauce, two rotten eggs, and a lasagna tray that had been in there since before Christmas.

Those may be some extreme examples, but nearly every dorm room or apartment in college has gone through their respective moments of shame, especially after a party. Sure, there is some degree of fun to be had for hosting a good party for all of your friends, dorm neighbors, and strangers, but when it really comes down to it, all that awaits you is a mess of epic proportions: Food. Bottles. Garbage. Vomit. It is usually all there after a big party. The counters and floors always seem to be sticky from spilled drinks and food, untold amounts of garbage somehow build up around the apartment, and the stench that rises out of the bathroom seems comparable to the smell of the county landfill. 

Expect to spend a few hours scrubbing away at your room to rid your place of the smells and stains. It is all part of the college experience. The filthy college experience.

Have no fear, though. With just the right amount of teamwork and elbow grease, it is possible to break the grip of grime. My roommates and I have devised a plan to keep our place spotless. We try to clean when all four of us are available, even if that means very late at night. Everyone volunteers for an area and works as quickly as possible to take care of it. Afterwards, we all walk through together to look for any single thing we can find that needs work. 

Cleaning and working together brings us just a little bit closer as roommates. A clean apartment is good for our morale as a whole. 

Living on campus in the dorms makes you appreciate what you have at home. Some of these memories I will carry with me for the rest of my life, no matter how messy they may be.
