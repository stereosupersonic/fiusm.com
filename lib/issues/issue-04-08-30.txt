Headline: Delta Phi Epsilon receives Rita Rossner Cup
Author: Julia Marchese / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Fifteen years ago, the Delta Phi Epsilon chapter at FIU was established. Because of the chapter's prestige, they have received the Rita Rossner Cup at a bi-yearly international conference in San Antonio, Texas this past July. 

"This is the highest honor bestowed on a chapter," said president Maria Garcia who attended the conference. "It shows the fruits of our labor." The chapter, consisting of about eighty ladies, was recognized for their community service efforts, recruitment, campus activities and overall sisterhood. 

Living by their motto, "To be rather than to seem to be," the ladies strive to make contributions to various organizations. Several events geared toward helping others teach the girls valuable life lessons.

The sorority has held a male pageant annually for the passed 13 years. Their "Campus Man" is chosen while they raise money for the Cycstic Fibrosis Foundation, their official philantropy since 1958. Males are judged based on their beauty, brains, dedication and talent. "The girls are very down to earth," said this year's Campus Man, Ian Lugo. "I support them in whatever they do."

Besides participating in Relay for Life, Dance Marathon and raising over one million dollars to benefit CFF, D Phi E also supports the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, a national organization dedicated to aid problems of anorexia and other eating disorders through methods of education to providing funds for research.

But, it's not all work and no play for the members, who's mascot is the unicorn. The girls show their school spirit by attending sporting and homecoming events decked out in royal purple and gold colors. Chapter meetings, retreats and lunches help members create bonds.

"I always look forward to our sisterhood summer retreat," said junior, Chereen De Boehmler. "We get the whole weekend to bond and to get to know each other on a whole different level.

Headline: Creative solutions keep random clutter at bay
Subheadline: so decorating can get underway
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
Moving in to a new dorm room shouldn't mean unpacking boxes full of stuff into an empty bedroom. Instead, you can do more with your new space than just organize. With some simple tips, a few bucks and a little creativity, you can take an old dusty dorm room and turn it into a pad fit for the college student you hope to be.   

Getting Started

First, keep in mind that in most housing units on campus the use of paint, wallpaper and nails is strictly forbidden. Make sure to ask for permission before you even think about building lofts or rearranging furniture in a hazardous way. 

Make sure to check with the housing office before doing any major remodeling in your new dorm. Beyond those rules, anything goes. 

As you begin unpacking the first lesson you'll learn is that space is a commodity in most dorm rooms. 

So make space by stacking shelves on your desk or use plastic crates to optimize space under the bed. 

You can also repack any extra items such as winter clothes and books in plastic containers and use closet organizers to make the most of the limited space in smaller closets. 

Now don't forget the area behind doors either. Buy shoe organizers and CD holders to keep your kicks and tunes right at arms reach. 

Try to introduce bright colors into your drab space by adding colorful sheets, comforters, curtains and rugs. Posters, collages and photos make for great decorations and allow you to add a little personality into your space. 

You can also bring in the sunny side of Florida by using beach towels as curtains or to decorate walls. Remember, color usually sets the vibe in a given space so choose wisely!

Colors & Lights

For those units with a built-in kitchen or refrigerator and microwave, bring a little color into your life with colorful magnets or use a little double-sided tape to adhere your favorite pictures to the fridge door. 

Matching dishes, cups and silverware also add to the surrey of colors and will help bring your new space together.

Need help setting the mood in your new abode? Lighting is an easy and inexpensive way to improve your mood or adjust to your every activity. 

Try small lamps with a 25-watt bulb for reading or watching TV. Floor lamps are also a great way to bring ambient lighting into a room. Just think, for only $12 or so you've found an inexpensive solution to the sterile fluorescent lighting you'll find in most dorm rooms. 

Desk lamps also provide just the right amount of light for those late night cram sessions when your roommate decides he/she needs to go to sleep early.

Odds & Ends

Once you've got all your knick-knacks under control in your new pad, it will be those harder to store items that will pose a challenge. For smaller objects use ice cube trays to organize easy-to-lose items such as erasers, paperclips, tacks and spare keys. 

Wire baskets also help you make the most of your space by keeping random clutter at bay. They are great for keeping snacks, remote controls, or even old receipts and movie stubs. Just try to keep in mind that the more things you own the more creative you'll have to be during your decorating spree. 

If you are finding that your walls are still a little bare, spruce them up with corkboards wrapped in fabric or inexpensive frames featuring your favorite art. Try framing coasters, match boxes or even birthday cards.

Fair Play 

Anything is fair game. Whatever your passion, there is always a creative way to keep those all-important things under wraps, out of the way or on display.

If you have a roommate make sure to get their opinion when decorating your new bungalow. The space is as much yours as it is theirs. Besides, it will make the transition from home to dorm much smoother and it will allow for some early bonding with your new roomie. 

Heck, you may even decide to go shower curtain shopping together! 

Regardless of what colors you choose or how organized you keep your space, decorating your dorm doesn't have to be as daunting and unpleasant as unpacking all your stuff. 

So go on...grab all those creative juices that got you into college in the first place and put them to good use. The better your dorm room looks, the better you'll feel about college, your new roommate and perhaps even your life.

Subheadline: Twelve Tips and Tricks for an Organized Move
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
When faced with moving away from home, students don't worry about moving but more about the items they can't live without. Here are some tips to help you achieve a successful, organized move.  

1. Leave the Junk Behind
Don't bring anything you don't really need. Wait until you move in and figure out what you or your roommate forgot to bring. It makes no sense to bring two TV's, two microwaves and two radios.

2. Buy Ahead
Make a list of things you are going to need before and after you move.  Try duct tape, bubble wrap or old issues of The Beacon. If you are low on cash, old towels will also protect those fragile items during the moving process.

3. Pack Early
Start packing as soon as possible. The earlier you start the less stress, confusion and anxiety you'll experience when it comes time to move.

4. Box It
A variety of boxes will help you get through the hassle of looking for bags, carts and plastic crates which can tear or break.

5. Mark It 
Black markers, felt pens or grease pencils are great for labeling boxes with information such as bathroom, bedding, or even fragile.

6. Lose Weight
Remember that boxes and crates can only hold so much weight. So, lighten the load by distributing the weight evenly among several boxes. This will keep you from having a soar back when it's all over.

7. Enlist Any Help You Can Get
 Don't take the hit of moving all by yourself...bring a friend, your parents, your old roommate or even the guy who helped you when you dropped a box in the elevator.

8. Secure Yourself  
Pack all your important documents such as credit cards, receipts, birth certificates and voter registration cards in the same place. This will make changing your address much smoother when you get to your new place.

9. Prepare Yourself
It may take some time to get settled in so pack a small bag with anything you will need for the first night in your new home.  Helpful items include: toiletries, snacks, a blanket and pillow, pen/paper and a few magazines. 

10. Make a Plan
Before you start unpacking, sit down and figure out a plan of attack for unpacking your stuff. If someone is going to help you unpack, let him or her in on your plan and give them something specific to do. This will keep them out of your hair and focused on the task at hand.

11. Arrange Everything
It's best to arrange your furniture and make sure all the boxes are out of the way before unpacking accessories and other items. Sometimes, it's best to start out by putting clothes away in closets and in drawers.  

12. Be a Neighbor 
Let everyone know that you moved by sending postcards, letters or e-mails. Try planning a small get-together after you've set up your new space.  Invite the neighbors and enjoy yourself...you've earned it!

Headline: President discusses issues important to university students
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
The Beacon recently had the opportunity to sit down with University President Modesto A. Maidique. Sitting comfortably in his office located on the fifth floor of PC, the president spoke candidly about the status of FIU and his thoughts on its future.Many of the questions for the interview were generated from your concerns about campus issues, and the new developments happening throughout FIU.  

Q: There are many construction projects and renovations happening at the University Park and Biscayne Bay campuses. Why build everything at once?

Because even by doing a dozen or a dozen and a half projects simultaneously, we are still behind where we need to be in terms of facilities. So, we are trying to as rapidly as possible build all the pieces of a great university.  And that's going to continue for years and years and as the student body grows we need to accommodate them. 

Q: Now that the football program has gone Division I-A, are we able to meet the requirement of 15,000 ticket holders at every game? 

I don't for a minute doubt that we will be able to do that. Also, I believe that to get huge attendance for Division Two football is almost impossible, unless you are a consistent national championship [team] year after year. What our transition to division I-A will bring us is phenomenal in terms of funding. It's a very exciting year and prospects are high. I have no doubt that we will get the attendance and we will have a very prized winning team. 

Q: What was the motivation behind starting a School of Hospitality in China? 

It's two-fold. We are a university that tries to have international outreach. The Chinese school will be a funnel through which professors who aspire to higher training will come here and get a masters or a Ph.D. in hospitality management and then return to China and teach. But even more significantly than that, that program has the potential to boost the budget of the hospitality program by 50 percent. If that program succeeds the way we expect it will, we can challenge Cornell University for the number one spot in the nation in hospitality management.

Q: Several organizational and personnel changes such as Marcos Perez, Dr. Rosa Jones have occurred throughout the summer months when the majority of students are away. Why make those important changes during the summer? How will these office and personnel changes affect students?

The objective of this organizational change was to identify a very talented person that would do nothing but worry about finance and budget. That is prompted by the fact that in the past five to ten years, our budget has gotten thinner and thinner and our workload is getting larger and larger. It's an attempt to figure out how to do more with less. All of the changes are designed to keep FIU competitive as it grows and to release some of my time to work both with donors, sponsors and supporters in the community and with the legislature, which is more and more what my job is becoming.

Q: Many students feel that while getting a football program, a law school and a medical school are great for FIU, they are experiencing limited resources in programs that already exist throughout the university. Now that plans for an FIU medical school are underway, how do you justify to students the spending of 45 million plus dollars to get a medical school? 

We would not be putting a dime into the medical school because it will be funded by the state, donors, supporters and by faculty practice plans that the school would have for its medical doctors and professors. It's a fallacy to think that the university will fund the medical school. We don't have a dime to spend on a medical school. We don't have a dime to spend on a law school. None of the existing money is going to any of those three programs. 

Q: After five years, the Dalai Lama will revisit FIU. What can students expect from his Holiness? How difficult is it to bring such a high profile personality to FIU?

My experience with the Dalai Lama is that he is one of the holiest people on the planet and that just having the opportunity to be in his presence uplifts you. His every word is worth listening to because he speaks from the heart, from the consciousness of a very wise, thoughtful and humane man. I certainly feel I am a better person by having been with him for a few minutes the last time he was here.  To get the Dalai Lama to visit takes years and years to work out a date. It takes a lot of contributors to sponsor the visit. It takes a lot of organizing and security. It's a challenging but very worthwhile effort.  

Q: Customer service has always been a concern for students at FIU. What is being done to remedy with this issue?

The first thing is to identify it as a problem, which we did some time back. Secondly, through these organizational changes we are bringing in a new associate vice president for enrollment management who will be in charge of admission, registration and financial aid. Those are three of the areas where we have had most of the concerns, especially in financial aid. We are talking to someone now which is in a much larger and much older university who has dealt and solved all of these problems over the years.  We also had a number of complaints about the cashiers, the controller, and we just brought in the executive vice president and chief financial officer of Visa International to work on financial aid.  We are aware of the problem, and we are working on it.

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter in response to Gretel Sarmiento's article published the week of July 19th. I do not pretend to be an expert in foreign affairs, however, I would like to state that this is the most ridiculous, uninformed piece of journalism that I have ever come across. 

I realize that this was an opinion piece, but the author made no effort to present both sides of this issue. 

Ms. Sarmento went on a tangent about Bush's policy concerning Cuba without any real research or facts to back up her opinion. 

First of all, Bush is not the originator of U.S./Cuba interaction. Lest we forget Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Embargo, the Cuban Missile Crisis? The U.S. has had a naval station at Guantanamo Bay for several years. Regardless, travel restrictions to Cuba have existed long before President Bush came into office. 

Bush's reforms to these travel restrictions come only as the result of an effort to stop funding the Cuban government. It is not an act of defiance against the Cuban people. 

The money that enters Cuba through tourism does not help the Cuban people. It funds the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy politicians who oppress the citizens of the island. 

Furthermore, the author referred to the United States as a "wealthy Cuba." Such a comparison is ludicrous considering she has the right to publish her own opinions in a university newspaper. 

If our president were really a modern day Hitler as the author implies, she would not have the privilege to say so. 

Obviously, this person has no respect for this country and the freedom that we can enjoy as citizens of the United States of America. 

I find her tirade to be disrespectful, offensive, and uninformed.

Subheadline: Students need spirit
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
To the Editor:

Panther pride, school spirit, and cheering. It sounds kind of corny. Many of you may not know about football or football traditions. I am a student who wants to start a tradition of support for our team and keep it rolling for years to come.

School spirit means showing up for the games and filling the football stadium. (The Lair) I urge all students to attend a game and join in the fun. There are a few things about cheering that you should know. Cheering is an art form. You should try to intimidate your opponent and energize our Panthers. This means that when the other team has the ball, you should cheer loudly to inspire our defense to be more pumped up and physical. This is especially important on third down and short yardage. At this time the young men really need our voices screaming "De-fense!"

When we have the ball on offense, the players prefer quiet while huddling and calling the play. (Remember, you should yell loudly when the other team is trying to snap the ball-this might make them jump offside Of course, once appositive play is made, loud cheering is welcomed. The loudest cheers are for touchdowns and game-winning scores.

As a Miamian, I've seen the historical advantage of the Orange Bowl 

Stadium. (Where our cross-town rivals- the Miami Hurricanes play) The home team has won much more often. I would like to see Panther Stadium (The Lair) establish this same tradition of home field advantage.

Imagine......fourth down on the one yard line, game on the line and our opponent is trying to score to win the game. Our team is tired, being driven back, and need strength for one last stand. The noise level rises as the Panther fans go into frenzy, louder and louder. The ball is snapped - total science - then, the line holds!

Panthers win! (What a rush.)

This is known as the twelfth man. Eleven players are on the field and one in the stands. (The fans)

So get to the field and be part of this American pastime. Sports promote teamwork, perseverance, and above all, sportsmanship. I ask that you represent our school properly by not throwing things or intimidating other teams' fans. 

Of course, some good natured ribbing is part of the festivities.

Be a good Panther and support your team. Go FIU!

Headline: First ladies make powerful impact on policies
Author: Kailani Koenig-Muenster / The Seattle Times/NEXT
&nbsp;
Hillary Clinton was our nation's first lady during my childhood and early adolescence. It wasn't until George W. Bush took office that I realized all first ladies were not like Hillary. 

Along with the rest of the world, I watched Hillary take a dive into America's political waters. Then the Clintons left the White House and it was then that I realized few first ladies escaped the traditional mold of being a mere shadow to the president. 

As we inform ourselves about our choices of elected officials on the Nov. 2nd ballot, we should also consider the role of first lady. What role should she play? How comfortable are we having her play a prominent role? And do we expect her to? Though an unelected position and often a behind-the-scenes one, a first lady can have an enormous impact on our nation's public policy and a prominent role in international affairs. 

In a first lady, I expect a woman like Hillary Clinton, someone who is active, outspoken and heavily involved with the issues she cares about. 

When a first lady exercises her political power and takes a stand on issues she is passionate about, she transforms the role from a mere figurehead to an inspirational leader who can influence public policy. 

A first lady is not just a wife, a position or a title. The first lady has an incredible and powerful opportunity to impact and change the country for the better. 

She should take advantage of her position to voice her opinions and advocate for what she believes in. 

Only a few first ladies have been successful in doing so. 

Hillary Clinton chaired the Task Force on National Health Care reform in 1993 and worked on the CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) to insure children are properly immunized. 

While many sum up her health-care role as a failure, she got a serious conversation going in this country about our health-care crisis, a conversation that continues today. 

Hillary Clinton also promoted policies that strengthened our public schools and helped parents balance work and family life. She advanced America's foreign policy objectives by traveling overseas and speaking out on democracy and human rights. 

After the Clintons left the White House in 2000, Hillary made history by becoming the only first lady to be elected to the United States Senate. 

Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, is another example of a woman who enlivened the position of first lady. 

Prior to her husband's presidency, her influence in the League of Women voters helped women attend the Democratic Convention for the first time in 1924. 

When her husband became president in 1933, she hosted a radio show, held press conferences, expressed her opinions, and traveled the world. 

Because Franklin Roosevelt was suffering from polio, Eleanor took the responsibility to visit troops, prisons and shelters, and spread good will to foreign countries during WWII. 

After Franklin Roosevelt died, President Truman appointed her to the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. She also chaired the Human Rights Commission during the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

In the years that followed, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to impact the international political scene. 

Our generation should expect a first lady who will not only make a mark in history, but who will also serve as a powerful role model for all Americans. It is important to take a stand on the issues we care about. Hillary Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt taught us that. 

The first lady has an awesome opportunity - and responsibility - to reach many people. She should expand her role by helping to formulate public policy for the nation and the world. 

That is, until we have a first man.

Headline: Country boy discovers fun and magic in the big city
Author: Nicholas J. Ronda / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Miami can be an intimidating place, especially for a newcomer to the Magic City like me, who's from a small town in Arkansas named Twist. 

Based on what I gathered about Miami before relocating here, I must admit I was a little afraid of roaming the streets after sundown. 

I transferred from the community college in Twist to FIU in order to be closer to my girlfriend.  But she wasn't as excited about my move as I was; that's when I realized  she dumped me for a football player. 

Sadly, he wasn't even one of the handsome hunks on our school team, no, this guy turns out to be a backup quarterback at a local mediocre high school football team. But I'm not bitter, not anymore at least. 

I came down to FIU to get a degree in international business.  So I looked for a job this summer hoping to find something that could provide me with some international business experience. 

After weeks of no luck and my loan money running out, I finally got a break with a Latin American Restaurant chain named La Carreta. 

My ideal position would have placed me in an envinronment where I could be hands-on with the day-to-day operations of the company, but I was offered an entry-level position bussing tables instead.  I guess I need to be a little more specific in my job interviews from now on. 

In Twist, we don't have as many options for entertainment activities  as Miami does. Yeah, we have squirrel hunting in the autumn, we have a bowling alley where Buck Rodgers once bowled a perfect game, and a cinema that can show up to eight pictures (or how they would say down here "ocho"). Twist however has nothing in comparison to South Beach, or so I thought.

In my first weekend as a free man, I went to South Beach with a buddy to "get jiggy with it." 

My buddy Hakim, a newcomer from Pakistan, and myself had never been to South Beach.  We were as excited as a 14-year-old girl at a Garth Brooks concert. We really didn't know where to go or  what to see next. 

Not knowing the hot spots, we strutted down the strip looking for some action, or whatever came our way. And boy did we ever! We actually came across a venue  named after my hometown, Twist.

I might not know how to party like the young people of Miami, but back  home I was as wild and crazy as Pauley Shore. 

As we first got acclimated with the venue, I was feeling a little uncomfortable. It was my first time in such a place. Back home, we don't have these kinds of places. What we do have is disco night at the bowling alley and a riverboat playhouse for the teenagers. 

The guys at work have told me some alarming stories about the attitudes of the guys at clubs here, but honestly, my heart was still too achy-breaky to put up my dukes.  I just wanted to have a good time.

 Thankfully, the guys at club Twist were real warm and friendly. They sat next to me and listened to my my girl trouble stories. 

Some even bought me a drink and offered a shoulder to cry, but I wasn't there to howl like some love-lost hyena, no sir, I was there to party. 

We didn't really come across many girls that night, but that didn't matter though, I wasn't  up for running my game much anyway. Because when you're down in the levy and it's all dried up, there's nothing like a room full of guys to cheer you up. No woman, no cry right?

I haven't been back to club Twist since that night, but I'm glad my first clubbing experience was a positive one.  

In the end, I appreciated the kindness of the strangers I met,  despite the hang-up of my recent breakup. 	   Hopefully this year at FIU will be as fun as my experience at club Twist.

It's like all the old-timers say back home in Arkansas, "you can live somewhere else, but your heart stays in Twist."

Headline: Seven of eleven starters returning for men's soccer
Author: Yanely Perez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After cruising through the season with a 14-5-3 record, the Golden Panthers stormed into the NCAA tournament with championship hopes on their mind.

After picking up victories in round one against UCF and CSUN in round two, FIU suffered elimination in the third round at the hands of UCLA.

After a stable off-season compared to last year when the team almost got eliminated due to lack of funds, the Golden Panthers return with seven of 11 starters and have goals of advancing further than last season.

"We want to win our conference, and then get to the NCAA championship. The goal is to go further this year than we did last year where we got to the third round," said Coach Karl Kremser who is entering his 25th season as coach of FIU.

The players worked together during the off-season and have also played scrimmages among themselves and other teams. 

With a scrimmage against Lynn in Boca Raton and Nova Southeastern at home, the team experienced a loss. 

But it gave a chance for players to get adapted to each other and learn from their mistakes as well.

"Unfortunately, the team became a bit disoriented and unorganized after Lynn scored that goal on us. Players had to open up and move forward in order to score a goal faster therefore causing the back to be left open and available for Lynn to score," said forward Fernando Plentz.

"Throughout the game we had been playing very well but mistakes like these are what are going to improve our chances to win." 

With many returning players including seven starters, the team is hoping experience will be an advantage for this season.

"We are working hard, running a lot, and considering the fact that there are a lot of returning players, we will do very good," said forward Oscar Gil.

"Not only are there returning players, but there are about 10 incoming freshman who are all somewhat new to what they are yet about to experienced."

Even with many new faces on the team, veterans consider these players to have potential.

"There are a lot of incoming freshman which can be pretty promising and can be a recruiting team. Down the line they can be much help and be very experience," said Plentz.

After being ineligible to play last year, goalkeeper Shawn Crowe is ready to take over the goalie job after Roy Rosenberg's graduation last season. 

 "From what I understand, this is a much better team than last years. In comparison to last year's goalie, I plan on being more organized and direct. It feels good to take over and by having more of a leadership role I believe the team can be successful," says Shawn Crowe.

Kremser knows that replacing Rosengberg who played every minute last year will be tough. However, he feels that if there's a person that can do it, it's Crowe.

"Shawn is capable of upholding that standard of soccer in our goals of playing without a doubt," said Kremser.

Qualifying for the final four of the NCAA tournament is what the coaches and players are all hoping to achieve. 

"From the looks of how practices have been coming along, the team looks well-rounded and ready to win. We are getting our legs back and have defensive organization as a team," said defense captain Allen Handy. 

 "Winning the conference and final four is what we are all looking forward to. "Reaching the Final Four and winning it all is what is important to us as a whole," added Plentz. 

 The team kicks off the regular season against Florida Atlantic on  Sept. 3 during the FIU Diadora Classic here at home. The team will wrap up the classic on  Sept. 5 against Georgia State.

Author: Ashley Butler / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Last year, the Golden Panthers had a lot of injuries, finishing 14-16. However this upcoming season includes only four returning players; eight new players (three junior college transfers and five freshman) and three that either sat out last year with an injury or red shirted.

Head Volleyball Coach Cookie Stevens is confident that this high depth team will make it far this year.

Out of all the girls, only 6 are native Floridians. Girl's volleyball gives a true meaning to the word "International" for Florida International University. These girls are from all over the world including Germany, Russia, Canada, Poland and the Virgin Islands. Two girls are from Virginia, one from Ohio and another from Kansas.  

"I like it here very much.  The girls are nice and training is hard. It's very different from Germany," says Ruth Flemig from Germany, who enjoys Steven's training.

"The international players are at a higher level which makes us deeper at every position and makes us stronger.  The new people will complement the existing players," said Stevens.

Not only are the majority of the girls new but also there are two new assistant coaches. Coach Greg Tompos who graduated from Canberra in Australia in 2003, and Alice Persinova, who graduated from the Technical University of Liberec, 2003 in the Czech Republic.

Being one of the many newcomers to the team, Greg Tompos, assistant coach excited about the upcoming season.

"I know that we're all looking forward to (everybody: players and coaches alike) bringing something new to this team this year," Tompos said. "The team has done an excellent job coming together, there's a lot of cohesion among the team right now and comraderie.  I think its going to be real positive that we have all these new people."

Some common goals this year include making it to the NCAA Conference Championship in New Orleans and upgrading themselves from last year's loss to New Mexico in the conference.  

Tough opponents include the Golden Panthers first home tournament on September 10 and 11th against UM.  

"We always want to beat Kentucky too, our rivals.  We want to beat everybody," says junior Laura Vogel.  

One of the top players this season, senior Jessica Jones, ready for any opposing teams that stand in her way.

"Anyone when you come out can be a tough opponent.  Every match we go into every team is going to be tough, that's the mentality we have to have," said Jones.

Assistant coach Tompos added, "We have to take this season one step at a time, and just getting to the conference tournament is our first step."

Headline: Coach Edwards: "Bottom line: We have to score goals"
Author: Ana Sanchez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Although plagued by injuries and three starters on the bench, the women's soccer team has a promising attitude for this year.

 Last season they finished a disappointing 2-11-2. Despite the record, many games where close including eight in which FIU lost by one goal.

Midfielder Yenesa Taddei, one of the key players on the team  is returning from an injury which sidelined her for all of last season.

 "I'm excited, happy that I'm not watching from the bench and I feel that it's a different year and a different attitude.The team is more confident, the coach is more confident and support within the team will make us stronger," said Taddei. 

 The team will kick off the season on Aug. 27 against state rival University of Central Florida, scoring goals will be an issue for the Golden Panthers who averaged under a goal a game last year. 

"We played well last year but we didn't score goals, bottom line: we have to score goals," said Coach Everton Edwards. 

Defender Magan Meade agrees, "Goals for this year include improving record and coming together as a team," said Meade. 

There are nine freshmen joining the team this season. Veteran players welcome their additions. 

"We have a lot of new players which are key players and they fill in the gaps of the team," said Meade. 

Edwards believes in working hard and still sees areas where the team needs improvement.

 "Work on yourself as individuals and it will come out on the field. As a whole, speed is slow and we need to work on that." 

Midfielder Charissa Gingerich believes the team is at a better level than last year at this same point.

 "We have a deep team this season, our attitude is a lot more positive, we are becoming a close team working for each other, things are looking good, and we are further along this year then we were last year."

The girls began preseason practice Aug. 12. The team has been working on conditioning twice a week, something Forward Tamara Kochen credits as helpful for the team.

"It's helped us out a lot, preseason was more competitive for the girls this year," said Kochen, who played for the Israeli National Team.

Headline: Graduating student athletes important for Edwards
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Women's soccer is headed into its 20th season this fall and the man behind the FIU women has been here from the start. FIU alumnus Everton Edwards opens the 2004 campaign in the same position he's held since the 1985 inaugural season - head coach. 

Edwards is credited with building the women's soccer program from scratch. As a player he holds the men's soccer records for most goalkeeper shutouts (10) and career goals-against-average (0.84). 

As a coach he's led the women's squad to a 2000 Sun-Belt Conference title, a 1993 Trans American Athletic Conference championship, and an NCAA appearance while coaching the team through 11 winning seasons.

 Coach Edwards is on the verge of his 150th career victory with FIU, a feat accomplished by just 36 other active coaches, only seven of which have won them all within the same school. The coach sat down with The Beacon to discuss the season.

Q: You've built this program from the ground up and have stuck by it for 20 years. What would this 150th win mean to you?

It doesn't mean a lot to me honestly. I'm from England and I've learned that American tradition is a lot of statistics. The biggest statistic really is for the kids to graduate. 

That's my main goal. I'd like these kids to graduate with good majors. I think college athletics has somewhat exploited the athletes. 

It's not that I don't care about the wins; I just think there's less perspective in what were here for. College Athletics has become a big money maker and I feel like 150 wins is nice, but what's more important is for me to get the student athletes to graduate.

Q: The past two seasons have been a bit of a struggle. After going 15-6-0 and 11-4-2 in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the team managed just four wins in the following two years combined. How have you dealt with the losing seasons?

     Yes, it's disappointing, but there have been many underlying factors. One thing about being a coach is that you have to take the good with the bad. I've learned to be on both sides of the situation. 

 These two losing seasons have really opened my eyes to judging people and how they perform. We've had quite a bit of bad luck. There have been a few injuries to crucial players. It's not like when you're a professional and you can just buy a player to plug in when someone is injured, or like some schools that carry a roster of 35 players.

We have a mere 24 players and when 6 of them are injured and three of them are your top players it really hurts. In this game you have to have a good squad and a bit of luck.

Q: FIU is slated to have one of the best defenses in the Sun-Belt Conference. What are you looking for out of your back line?

The back line is stronger this year. We have a lot of good additions. In fact we have a lot more depth at defense and a lot of depth at the midfield, but now we have two of our main forwards out. My main concern is forwards right now.

Q: The freshman class is loaded with high school all-county and all-state selections, even a nationally ranked tri-athlete and a starter on the Israeli National side. Are any of these ready to contribute right away?

Two are hurt and one will have to be red-shirted. We have a lot of returning players that can contribute.

Q: You're coming into the season with two inexperienced keepers in Carly Argo and Madeline Gannon. Is this an area of concern on the squad? 

We do have very inexperienced goalkeepers. All I can say is that we'll see because, right now, we still have a bit of work to do there. 

Q: With 3 returning forwards and 3 talented newcomers at the position, who is most likely to start the season opener against in-state rival UCF?

     When you look at last year, I think in seven or eight games we lost by one goal. In our conference we placed last in goals-for and third in goals-against. The bottom line is you have to score goals to win. 

     We've already had two of the new forwards hurt within the last three weeks. As far as who is going to start, we'll be doing a lot of attacking during today's practice. I'll decide afterwards. 

Q: Given the performance of the past two years and the tough upcoming schedule, which features the likes of UCF, Denver, Texas, FSU and UF, what would constitute a successful 2004 campaign?

     I would like to get to .500; the reason being that we'll need that to be competitive in the conference. I can actually go and get 3 or 4 easy games to start the season 3-0, but if I was into records, I would have done that years ago. I've never done that. I look to get the best out of my student athletes. You have to play good competition. 

A lot of coaches are judged by their records, but good coaches know you're measured by who you play.

Headline: Kremser's goals: Reaching soccer NCAA championship
Author: Xavier Villarmarzo / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
After reaching the NCAA tournament last season, men's soccer will begin the season ranked No. 23 in the nation. Returning as coach for the 25th year here at FIU is  Karl Kremser who last season picked up his 300th victory as head coach.

Kremser has led the Golden Panthers to three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and this season he expects nothing less. Kremser sat down with The Beacon and discussed this upcoming season.

Q: What are your goals for this upcoming season?
Our goals are the same as every year. We want to win our conference, and then get to the NCAA championship. The goal is to go further this year than we did last year where we got to the third round.

Q: How do you plan to replace for the loss of MLS draftee John Pulido?

John did very well for us and he's doing quite well in the MLS, but we have Lucas Scudeler and Jean Camere who play very good. Lots of people we can plug into that position and once we get issues resolved with Luis, we will be fine.

Perea with the NCAA [ineligible to play at the moment],  will be a striker who can be a phenomenal player for us. He is just 17 years old and an outstanding player. 

David Hope has also played very well as well as Fernando Plentz who was our leading scorer of the bench last year until he got hurt. They will fill all  the spots.

Q: Who will replace the loss of goalkeeper Roy Rosenberg, who played every minute last season?

We have a couple. Andres [Arguello] who red shirted last year will be there for us but [Shawn] Crowe without question will be our starter at goal. He was academically ineligible last year for a misunderstanding academically but in fact he is a very good student.

 Not to minimize the loss of Roy, but Shawn is capable of upholding that standard of soccer in our goals of playing. Bernarr [Steele] is outstanding talent down the road.

Q: You will be playing (No. 2) St John, (No. 3) North Carolina, and Wake Forest (No. 6) among the tough teams in your schedule this season. Who do you think will be your toughest opponents?

Everyone we'd love to beat, but right now we have to focus on our first game against FAU, which always turns out to be an intense rivalry and also all those are fantastic games. 

Then after the first game, we will find out where we are very quickly. 

Q: How can you top the season your team accomplished last year, where they won the ASC division title and made it to the NCAA season?

We want to win the title and go to NCAA but make it past the third round, at least one more round than last year. 

If we pass the third round we have chance to go to the final four. It is not an unrealistic goal with the people we have here, we have to pull it off but it depends an awful lot on concentration and willingness to work from our players.

Q: Speedster Caron Williams showed lots of potential last year. Is he ready to lead the team?

One thing Caron does and that he has more than anyone else is outstanding speed. He will stretch the defense but we will need a goal scorer behind him to help him because he has ability to break the game open.

Q: Your team will begin the season ranked No. 23, is that where the team deserves to be?

I think definitely where last year we finished ranked 13; I think that's fine. We can be better than that but it depends on how hard we work.

Q: What new comers should fans keep an eye on?

One of the people so far is Lucas Rodriguez from Killian whose come out quicker than what we felt. Perea who I mentioned earlier is very good. 

One of the freshmen is Marcelo Aguirre who has done well. We also see good things out of Jean Camere who played in final [NCAA championship] last year for St. John.

Q: What can fans expect from attending games this season?

I always try to encourage people to come watch us. People are always impressed on how we play and we take lots of pride in how we play. Fans always give us great compliments that they enjoy watching us play. 

We always look for special players to do creative things and bring excitement to the game. If people can just come out to one game, they always will come back after watching us once.

Headline: The troubles with Panthersoft
Author: Amanda Ramírez Castañeda / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As of July 1, the new Panthersoft system permanently replaced the SIS system the FIU community had been using for approximately four years.  

Although the new system has been partially running since February 2004 the students were not faced with the dilemma of getting accustomed to the new system until August during registration week. 

To many trying to register, the change from SIS to Panthersoft has seemed to cause much confusion and frustration.

 "The students are just expecting to register as usual and that is not what is happening.  I mean you have regular registration problems and now you also have the problem of getting used to a new system. It's just evil," said Jamie Moo-Young, a student and lab assistant at FIU.  

As many students have found out, the Panthersoft system has a completely different format than the previous SIS system.  Everything from the web address to  students' individual identification number have changed. That, apparently, has left many students unprepared.  

"The biggest challenge with Panthersoft has been communication.  Some students rarely visit the campus and because of that they don't see the flyers...they don't see the information tables we've set-up and some do not check their FIU e-mail account. Some students weren't aware that this change was going to occur," Yogi Misir, associate director of marketing and customer relations for UTS said. 

Other than the initial surprise of a new system, students encountered other problems while trying to register for classes using Panthersoft.

"I think it's cool how you can get [a class] schedule and check your financial aid online-but I don't like the fact that a time or a place for one of my classes doesn't appear on the system. Now when I go and check the class, it doesn't even come up as a registered class," said Stanky Stankiewicz, a marketing student.

 Ben Guanella, a civil engineering major, agrees.

"I had to get the same hold removed four times. I also don't like that if you want to take a class that is not in your specific major you have to go get a password and code from whatever department the class is in.  It takes-up too much time." 

The department of customer service for Panthersoft has received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from students trying to register on a daily basis since registration began. 

"A lot of calls or e-mails are from students who are just trying to get used to the system and they get frustrated because the new system doesn't look like the old," said Nermari Broderick is in charge of UTS Marketing and Customer Relations. "Usually by the time they contact me they are already completely frustrated and some students let that show.  But we do take their feedback, however they might say it, back to the team to see how we can use it to better the system."

One main issue the students had with registering for classes on the new system was that, during the first days of registration, in order to select classes for the fall term they had to enter a code.  Not many students knew the code or even knew they needed to know a code to register.  One student that faced this problem was Rico Irribarren.  

"Personally, I like the new system but I do think it was a pain how you had to know a number to choose fall, 1048 I think it was. That is ridiculous. Who is going to remember a number to choose fall?" Irribarren said.

 "The majority of the issues have been related to the change process," said Ivon Foster, assistant vice president for the division of information technology. "There have been some other issues that we have worked on as far as modifying the system. Most of the modifications have been made based on the feedback we have received from students and facult."

A large number of students also encountered problems with the finances department.

"Financial aid needs to make sure they're on the ball with the new system. They are using it for the first time as well as the students and I feel they need to be trained a little bit more on how to go about doing things on the system before they can do anything else.  That is why you see such a long line outside," said John Cabarga, a marketing major. 

Guanella was also upset about the situation in the financial aid department. "They told me at financial aid that they can't process my paperwork until they figure-out the system. One of the officials told me 'Here is your short term loan and good luck with the rest of your tuition on your own,' " Guanella said.  

When asked about the line in PC for the finances department, Robert Grillo, director of the administrative software unit at UTS denied it had anything to do with Panthersoft.

"I feel the line [was formed] because people were lining-up since early in the morning to try to pay or get assurance that their payment was received. The cashiers office wasn't open so the line was already building-up," he said. 

The director also acknowledges that the problem of credit card usage played a role in the formation of the massive lines.

"It has to do with the issue of what credit cards the university is accepting and that they didn't open the ball room this year, as they did in previous years, in order for students to pay," he added.

&nbsp;
Murmurs of "I can't believe the summer's over!" can be heard throughout campus. As many students might point out, the first week of school can sometimes prove to be a frustrating time. With this in mind, the Biscayne Bay Campus will host its annual Welcome Week from Aug. 30 through Sept. 4, a series of events organized by the Student Programming Council. 

"This is a hectic week, and we want to make it more bearable for the students. Welcome Week's events are designed to get students excited about the upcoming school year," said Rafael Zapata, assistant director of Campus Life.  

Kylie Ferguson, Fall Fest chair on the SPC Committee, claims the preparations for that single week have been long in the works. "I have been planning these events since last March," she said.

The events will kickoff Monday near the Undergraduate Studies Office in AC-I where students will be able to indulge in a variety of BBQ foods.

More events for the day will include free caricatures at the Panther Square and giveaways by the Y-100 truck near the AC-II Loop from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. 

On Aug. 31, the Freshman Luau at AC-I will provide musical entertainment along with free food.

"I am most interested in the Freshman Picnic and Luau because I want to see how many freshmen turn out and if the numbers exceed last year's," said Wetsee Jean-Pierre, SPC secretary.	 

Thursday Sept. 2 , there will be a distribution of Papa Johns pizza by the  WUC building as students shuffle between classes.

The last major welcoming event SPC has in store will take place on Sept.10 with a comedy show featuring comedians such as Leon Rogers and Dexter Angry.  Doors open at 8 p.m. with the show beginning at 9 p.m. After the Comedy Show, there will be an after-hours party with DJ Epps.

Eric Hernandez, junior, has participated in the events before and admits he appreciates all the events planned out for the students.

"It was a nice break from searching for classes and getting bombarded with new information," he said. 

Campus Life members also agree that the week was coordinated with freshmen in mind.

"We just want to make the students feel welcome," added Zapata. "We want them to have good feelings about FIU."

Headline: College of Law closer to full accreditation
Author: Michelle Arean / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The FIU College of Law received provisional accreditation by the American Bar Association on Aug. 9th, which may be considered the first step in a long journey to obtaining full accreditation.

Now, after crossing the school's first hurdle, the 50 students planning to graduate in May 2005 will be able to sit for the Bar Exam and practice law. 

"We are very proud of our accreditation and to be under the leadership of Dean Strickman," said Carolina Suarez, second-year law student, referring to both the long-awaited event and the College of Law's dean, Leonard Strickman. 

The college had to meet many qualifications in order to acquire this provisional accreditation. The American Bar Association reviewed such things as the quality of the student body; experience and credentials of the faculty; facilities available; holdings, quality and size of the college's library collection; student services; career planning and placement; and the complete, overall quality of the academic program offered. 

"All important criteria were met comfortably. We are blessed with the support from the state and the FIU resources to attract an excellent faculty and provide good temporary facilities," said Strickman. "We are also blessed with demographics. We are the only public law school in this metropolitan area and have a great, diverse student body." 

The Association sent a site team of six people to examine all aspects of the school. Their final report was then submitted for consideration. Their report did not offer an evaluation; it simply served as a basis to determine if the school is fit for accreditation. 

"Dean Strickman and his colleagues have done an excellent job in successfully attaining provisional accreditation for FIU's College of Law. We look forward to working with them as the school seeks full accreditation," said John Sebert, consultant in legal education to the American Bar Association.  

Students also participated in the processes. The Association takes into consideration the type of student environment the school has created. 

They spoke with many law students around campus and invited all 208 students to voice their opinions on the school in a meeting with no professors present.

The association also looked through the exams the students had taken, as well as the students' answers, to see how competitive they are. 

"The student faculty ratio is so small that it gives a lot of opportunity for students to ask questions and get answers inside the classroom as well as out," said Alejandro Alvarez, a third-year law student and president of the FIU Student Bar Association.  

In celebration of their accomplishment, the College of Law gathered in the Law School student lounge on the afternoon of Aug. 24th.

The lounge, usually quiet and filled with students studying for upcoming exams, became a place of celebration as Dean Strickman toasted to everyone involved with the college. 

"The component which I am the proudest of is this faculty. This is the most amazing faculty for this law school; for any law school in America. Let's toast to the faculty," said Strickman. 

At the celebration, every component that contributed to the formation of the law college was toasted - even the recently admitted first-year students, who began their law studies just two days before. 

At the end of the toast, Alvarez added in a speech for the dean's honor, "To Strickman, our fierce leader." 

However, the administration and the students are aware that the journey is not yet over. The college expects to gain full accreditation by 2007.

Before that happens, the new building must be completed, being that the college must have its own facilities in order to gain full accreditation. Also, the first class has to have graduated and the association must review how well they performed on the Bar.

"I am looking forward to starting in the new building. Now, we are making due with what we have," said Suarez.  

Despite the odds that the college must still face, faculty members are hopeful.

"The current students are holding our future. I am confident the students will pass the Bar at a rate that won't prohibit accreditation. Our program is well prepared to get them ready for it," said Strickman. 

As the celebration continued, it became evident that the students were proud of their school having gained the  provisional accreditation. 

"It's a fulfilling time. A lot of us came here not knowing if we could sit for the bar. Everything they told us has come true. They reassured us time and time again and here it is," said Alvarez.

Headline: Blazing a new trail
Subheadline: Campus organizations spark FIU tradition
Author: Providence Okoye / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
As part of their goal to establish new events that might one day become FIU traditions, the Student Alumni Association has been working on a project they call the 'Trail of the Torch,' co-sponsored with the Student Government Association. 

"It is time to create a new tradition for FIU. The campus has been craving traditions and I think it's the right thing to do for [the univeristy]," said Sean Kramer, assistant director of Alumni Relations.

The idea was originally conceived by Bryon Tompkins, the SGA representative for Arts and Sciences.

"I want FIU to be richer in traditions," he said. "The Torch of Service is never lit and, since it should always be lit, I thought of an idea to light it in a way the Olympics light their torch."

The torch that will be used is the Torch of Knowledge, Service and Understanding, established in 1972 in memory of the late Senator Ernest R. Graham. Still, despite the longetivity of the torch, SGA has tried several times to reinstate the perpetual burning of the torch, which students have found many times to be unlit.

With the commencement of this event, the organizations believe thegoal of having an ever-burning flame on campus is nearer to fulfillment.

The Trail of the Torch will be a candlelight procession across FIU's Univeristy Park campus culminating in the lighting of the school's torch of service. The event is meant as a symbolic start of the new school year, welcoming all new freshmen. 

"It is not just a student event - the whole university is part of it and it is going to be exciting. If you can visualize 400 students marching across campus with candles culminating with the lighting of the Torch, that's how great it will be," said Kramer.

Other major universities have been known for some of their varied traditions. For example, Florida State University is famous for its War Chant Tradition, Marching Chiefs Tradition, and so forth.

Both the SAA and SGA believe that the torch procession will eventually become such a tradition at FIU.

"I think it's a great, new, exciting tradition that's going to be happening for FIU and especially incoming freshmen. I think in the future, it is going to be the largest tradition we would have here at FIU," said Larissa Lockett, president of the Students Organization Council, one of the organizations massively promoting this event.

According to the plan, the procession would start from the FIU football stadium ('The Cage'), ending at the Torch of Service located in front of the Charles Perry Building.

"It's the one event following Freshmen Convocation that will promote unity amongst the new and current students, the alumni and the FIU community at large," said Kimberly Castillo, president of the Student Alumni Association. 

Also scheduled for the event is a short speech by Ty Javellane, the president of the FIU Alumni Association, and Jorge Rosario, the SGA president. The processison is set to begin soon afterwards. 

About 300 to 400 students are expected to attend.

According to Sean Kramer, the Graham Center catering staff along with the staff of both Gracie's Grill and the Bookstore will be wearing shirts promoting the event.

SAA and SGA members have also planned an extensive promotion which they claim is hard to miss. 

"I have never felt as certain about an event as I do about the Trail of the Torch," said Castillo concerning the success she thinks the celebration will be. "I believe it is an event that will [bridge] differences. It will be known as a tradition that provides incoming students...a bright, new and exciting start at FIU." "I think it is the [biggest] event that has come to FIU since Dance Marathon," said Kramer, who takes responsibility for introducing the 25 hour event which annualy raises money for kids at Miami Children's Hospital.

"Hopefully, in the near future, we would have great media coverage, lots of publicity and notable attendees from Faculty, Deans, the President and prominent alumni outside the university," said Lockett.

Following the Trail, the coordinators have arranged for a "Slip-n-Slide" foam party right by the Torch. 

The event is scheduled to take place Sept. 1 at 7:30 p.m. Students who are members of school organizations are encouraged to meet at 7:30 p.m. at the FIU Football Stadium  for the reception of candles.

Headline: Packing up: A guide for essential college furnishings
Author: Debra D. Bass / St. Louis Post-Dispatch
&nbsp;
ST. LOUIS - In the age of cheap, portable conveniences, students leaving home this fall to room on campus aren't worried about leaving the material comforts of home behind. They are worried about where to put everything they can't live without. 

"My roommate last year brought everything from home _ I mean everything," said Michael Jarmon, 20, a junior at St. Louis University. "There was almost a whole carpet for the floor and a little personal rug to step on as he got out of bed." So much for the notion of guys packing light. 

Jarmon, an aviation sciences student from Atlanta, said he was more practical in his packing, but by the end of the year, he still grappled with storing things he had acquired throughout the year. 

He warns fellow students to plan storage options _ ask for the dimensions of your room, shelf space availability and the clearance for sliding totes under the bed. (Beds in some dorms can be raised as high as 3 feet, and most dorms offer the option of making twin beds into bunk beds.) 

Every student we talked to couldn't stress the space constraints enough. It can be sobering if you've never had to consciously think about the limitations of your living environment. We don't live in a nation where we have to worry about the logistical ramifications if we buy a couple of new books or decide to buy a larger George Foreman grill. There's always room in the back of some cabinet, on the top shelf in a closet or in a box in the garage. 

The bald eagle may be the official national symbol, but the pack rat is what we see in the mirror. So we asked students to tell us what items they think are essential and what pitfalls to avoid in packing for dorm life. 

"I wouldn't leave home without one of those hanging bars for the closet that gives you twice as much space and a shoe rack for the door," says Lynsey Hudak. She'll be a senior finance major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the fall. 

Moderation is important, Hudak says, yet students shouldn't feel as if they can't express their decorative side.

 She and her roommate are adopting a Mardi Gras theme for their apartment-style dorm room, so you can expect colorful beads, the obligatory porcelain face masks and a mandatory Bourbon Street poster. "Les bonne temps" will be celebrated with a French ribbon bulletin board for photos. Please note that these are all wall items that will not infringe on storage space. 

"No matter what, there's never enough space," says Ashley Smith, who will be a sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis this fall. "Even if you bring the minimum, by the end of the year people always complain about having too much stuff to pack." 

Smith works in the resident housing office at Washington University and says that most students exercise restraint in decorating and stocking their rooms with the necessities and tchotchkes, but more than a few students tilt toward the extreme. An incoming freshman called to ask about the dimensions of the door frame because he wanted to bring an elliptical exercise machine, which is a cross between a stair climber and a treadmill. He was told to use one of the two gyms on campus instead. 

"That's an extreme, but some people do get carried away," Smith says. She says she doesn't bring a lot of accessories with her because "it's not like I'm never going home again." 

ESSENTIALS

What essentials would we take off to college? 

- 92-quart tote, $12.99, Target (www.target.com). Some can even be checked as luggage if the top is secured with tape or string and isn't too heavy. 

- Two bath towels, $9.99 each, Target. Don't forget the coordinating loofah or face cloth.

- 12-foot rope light, crinkled clear, $6.99, Target. Illuminates like candles without the fire hazard. 

- Mesh pop-up laundry hamper, $2.99, Walgreens (store locations at www.walgreens.com). Cheap, handy and folds down to almost nothing. 

- Scotch Medium Adhesive Blue Painters Tape, $3.99, Target. Great for hanging posters or photos without putting holes in the wall. Roll small strips end over end to simulate double sided tape. 

- Electronics surge protector, 6-foot cord, $9.99, Target. Depending on the size of your room, you may need a 20-foot cord to maximize your flexibility. 

- 21-by-34-inch striped nylon accent rug, $14.99, Bed Bath & Beyond (www.bedbathandbeyond.com). It'll keep your feet from touching a chilly floor first thing in the morning, and it's a good way to individualize your space. 

- X-long twin sheet set, $14.99, Target. We like jersey sheets best because you don't have to worry about thread count, and they feel like a well-worn T-shirt.  

- Bookends, $19.99, Pier 1 (www.pier1.com). Necessity doesn't have to look Spartan. 

- Clip lamp, $9.99, Bed Bath & Beyond. A mobile lamp source that doesn't take up floor or desk space. 

- Shoe organizer, 24 slots for 12 pairs of shoes, $9.99, Bed Bath & Beyond. Use the slots for shoes, spare pencils and pens or emergency Ramen noodles.  

- Accent pillow, $9.99, Target. It's a nice touch and makes a convenient cushion when you're asking a friend to pull up a crate. 

- Wall clock, $19.99, Bed Bath & Beyond. Monks' quarters, prisons and waiting rooms shun clocks, but you shouldn't. Pick a lively one instead of squinting at a laptop tool bar to find the time. 

- Small bathroom tote with a handle, $6.99, Bed Bath & Beyond. Find one big enough to store everything you use in the bathroom in one place from soap to Q-tips. A handle just makes life easier. 

- Extra closet rod, $9.99, Bed Bath & Beyond. Double your horizontal space in small closets. 

Practical items: 

- A computer chair, or at least a chair cushion, because you'll probably get the standard-issue hardwood spine nemesis. 

- Dishes for two and utensils for four, because you'll lose some. 

- A flashlight. 

- A small tool kit and emergency kit. 

- Bed lifts. These can raise your bed 5 to 7 inches and allow for more storage. 

Why didn't we mention an alarm clock? Because maybe you don't need one. If you're like most students, you live with a cell phone that is always within hand's reach. Free up an electrical outlet, and just set your phone for a perpetual wake-up call. 

In fact, it's probably got multiple alarm functions, and you can set it to alert you for every single class. 

Sorry - no more excuses for skipping a lecture.
