Headline: WAR?
Subheadline: Union fights administrators over raises, benefits

A NOTE FROM THE EDITOR
This story is a re-print from the March 28 issue of The Beacon. Due to a technical problem with the newspaper's printing services, the story's original large cartoon graphics deleted a significant portion of the story, rendering it unreadable. 

We apologize for the inconvenience and delay of publication and thank you for your patience and continuing readership.

Recent battles between FIU faculty and the Board of Trustees over a labor contract leave many expecting negotiations to end in a gridlock, yet again.

Some of the main issues in the negotiation include: summer pay, sabbaticals, inventions, promotion procedures and the possible removal of disciplinary action for faculty to file grievances.

The Florida government decided to leave bargaining in the hands of individual universities after the statewide contract expired in January 2003. Initially, FIU did not recognize the faculty union as an authorized bargaining agent. But then the courts decided that the Board of Trustees is a successor employer, which means that they needed to follow the old contract until a new agreement was reached in January 2004, thereby making the faculty union an authorized bargaining agent. Negotiations began in June 2004.  

If issues such as sabbaticals, inventions, promotion procedures and disciplinary action are part of the contract, then they are subject to grievance and arbitration procedures. If the issues are removed from the contract and instead made into university policy, then the policies cannot be subject to arbitration and may be changed without bargaining with the United Faculty of Florida's FIU chapter. Florida law prohibits professors from striking.  

The issue reached a climax on March 7 in the Graham Center Ballroom. UFF President, Alan Gummerson declared "war" on the administration during the Board of Trustees meeting and said the faculty will "continue to fight as long as it takes."  

According to a Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel article Trustee Chief Adolfo Henriques threatened to call security to remove more than 100 union members from the Board of Trustees public meeting after they booed him during the meeting.

Mark Rosenberg, provost and executive vice president for the Board of Trustees, referred to these differences as, "philosophical issues of article vs. policy," in an e-mail to the university sent shortly after the meeting. 

"Rights and protections of your working environment are guaranteed through institutional policies and procedures," Rosenberg wrote.

Judy Blucker, chief negotiator for the Board of Trustees, said in an interview with The Beacon that it was the board's full intention to bargain. 

"It's our full intention to make sure that [after policies are bargained and accepted] they will not change," said Blucker. 

The administration said it would create its own institutional grievance procedure. Blucker countered that if most grievances were not resolved and "continue to fester and the person complains and they even think about filing a law suit," then the provost will see that there's something wrong with the process and make changes. 

Exactly who will take part in a final internal grievance process, if it was to happen, is not yet clear. Blucker said there is a possibility it may even be a faculty-peer review.

"If there is trust and good will and peace, and it doesn't continue to be a problem of people being unhappy, the provost will be able to see that and know the process is working," Blucker said. "Only time will give us the answer."

Six grievances have gone to arbitration during the 18 years Blucker has been involved with the FIU administration.  

"Is it such a big deal?  It's been our history of correcting things at the first level," Blucker said, referring to why the faculty wants arbitration rights.  

Gummerson agreed that the university is successful at solving grievances locally, which is why he found the administration's attempt to remove arbitration rights so troubling. 

"Where is the problem that leads to such severe attacks on faculty rights and protections?" Gummerson asked, in a written response to Rosenberg's e-mail. 

Salaries are another source of contention. According to Rosenberg's e-mail, the board proposes a two percent raise across the board and a 2 percent merit increase for the remainder of the academic year.  

In response, Gummerson reminded Rosenberg that the salary increase proposed is not retroactive and that the faculty's last raise, which was across the board, was in Dec. 2002.  

There is no deadline for the faculty and the administration to come to an agreement. If negotiations reach an impasse, the Board of Trustees has the right to impose a settlement. The professors can vote against the contract, which means that after the contract is imposed, it only lasts for a year. When the year is up, new negotiations can begin.

"I think the president and I want to reach an agreement so that we can end this conflict and let everybody get back to doing what they do best - teaching and doing research," Blucker said.  

Gummerson disagrees. "We think that what their intention is and has been all along is to declare an impasse," he said.  

Gummerson said that if negotiations keep dragging, the Faculty Senate could use a vote of no confidence.  

"And we've got one other whole card," Gummerson said.  

The trustees must then bargain with the faculty in order to give "discretionary pay." 

"We'll be willing to allow it, but not if they demand that we give up our rights and protections," Gummerson said.

The Board of Trustees, like the faculty, also has strong beliefs about negotiations.

"The biggest issue for [faculty] is all of these articles that became policies. If that's absolutely in their mind an issue that they are going to go to the mat for ... then we will have impasse because our board is very committed to have these as policy," Blucker said.

Headline: Diaz sets record in first conference series
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Senior Dennis Diaz set the Sun Belt Conference career stolen base record March 26 as the Golden Panthers opened their conference schedule against Arkansas State University March 25-27 at the baseball stadium at University Park.

The Golden Panthers won the first two games of a three-game series against the Indians.

FIU improved their season record to 20-9 after going 3-3 over Spring Break, including a split in a series against Manhattan, March 18 and 19, and a 10-3 loss to the University of Miami on March 23.



FIU 6, ASU 2



Senior starting pitcher David Asher (6-0) picked up his conference-leading sixth victory in FIU's first conference game of the season.

"The first [conference] game is big," said Coach Danny Price. "It's just like the first game of the season. You like to get out and get that first win under your belt."

Asher pitched eight and two-third innings, allowed eight hits, two runs (one earned), walked three and struck out five batters.

"This is the best I've ever thrown all year," said Asher. "Conference play is big. So when you get a win, it's big."

Senior Danny Hernandez recorded one out in the ninth inning, via strikeout, to earn his fifth save of the season.

Junior right fielder Yahmed Yema, went 3-for-4 with a double and an RBI. Second baseman Corey Lozano, left fielder James McOwen, first baseman Michael Lopez and third baseman Nick Cadena each had two hits to pace a 14-hit attack for FIU.

An RBI single by Dennis Diaz and an RBI groundout by Cadena in the second inning put FIU up 2-0.

The Golden Panthers made it 5-0 after scoring three more runs in the fourth inning.

ASU got on the board in the sixth inning off an errant pick-off attempt by catcher Cody Jacobs.



FIU 5, ASU 2



Diaz recorded his 126th career stolen base in the first inning to break the Sun Belt Conference record previously held by Tyrone Dixon of South Alabama (1990-1993), and Billy Webster of Virginia Commonwealth (1984-1987).

Starting Pitcher, Ammer Cabrera (5-2), went five innings to earn the win. The redshirt junior allowed two runs, three hits, walked two and struck out two.

Junior Frank Gonzalez pitched four scoreless innings of relief, retiring 12-consecutive ASU batters to earn his first save of the season and his career. Gonzalez struck out two batters and walked one. 

Diaz went 2-for-4 with two stolen bases, a two RBI and two runs scored. Lopez, Cadena and shortstop Luis Rivera each added a hit as FIU had only five for the game.

FIU jumped off to an early 2-0 lead with a little help from four stolen bases. The first run came off an RBI groundout by Cadena and the second came when Lopez stole home plate.

The Indians tied the game at two in the fourth inning off a two-run homerun.

FIU pulled away in the fifth inning after scoring three runs.



FIU 12, ASU 13



A six-RBI day from senior Jeff Skellenger, which included a grand slam, wasn't enough as FIU blew leads in the seventh and eighth innings to squander their shot at a sweep against a conference opponent.

Freshman Elih Villanueva (5-2) was tagged for seven runs in only three innings of work as he failed to record a strikeout for the first time this season.

Danny Hernandez was slated with his first loss of the season after allowing four runs (two earned) in one total inning of relief.

Lopez, who went 3-for-5 with a three-RBI, and Cadena, who went 2-for-3 with three runs scored, each hit a homerun.

After FIU jumped out to an early 2-0 lead, the Indians replied with seven unanswered runs in the third inning to take a 7-2 lead.

However, FIU tied the game at seven after scoring five runs in the bottom of that inning - four coming off Skellenger's grand slam.

The Golden Panthers took a 10-7 lead following the Cadena homerun and a misplayed fly ball that scored Yema and McOwen.

Hernandez came into the game in the eighth inning with two outs and runners on first and second. ASU tied the game following a double and a two-RBI single.

FIU took a 12-10 lead in the bottom of the inning, only to see it fade away as ASU came back with three more runs in the ninth.

Headline: Magazine steers youths away from steroids
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
In the middle of all the hype about steroids and artificial muscle growth in the sports world nowadays, two high school friends and football players from Cleveland, Ohio, Chad Zimmerman and Nick Palazzo, have discovered a way to keep high school and college athletes away from this un-healthy lifestyle. 

They started Stack, a magazine which aims to teach high school and college athletes about training without the aid of any kind of drug or hormone stabilizer. 

"When we were trying to improve ourselves, we couldn't find any information. It was all for body builders. We thought, `Wouldn't it be great if there was a place for us?'" said Palazzo in an interview with the Dallas Morning News.

The first issue of Stack  came out after both of its creators graduated from college. It featured basketball all-star LeBron James in a thorough interview that described his training process. 

With the media's current coverage of Major League Baseball players taking steroids, high school athletes have noticed that a small percentage of professionals rely on drugs and other supplements to   better their game. 

Steroids and similar drugs can cause depression, heart attacks and mood swings but people rarely think of the consequences and side effects.

Stack features individual training and exercise routines the pros use. Armed with this information, high school and college athletes can make their own routines with which they feel comfortable. 

The magazine offers exercises and routines made for people who are not gym buffs or for those who have never stepped into a gym.

"I think the idea of a magazine that aids athletes with better workout habits would definitely end up in giving them a better lifestyle," said sophomore Ana Cortow. 

Senior Rick Heinz, who is majoring in health education, thinks reading the magazine could also benefit athletes who don't enjoy their current exercise program and wish to learn about new ones.

"FIU athletes would benefit drastically from this magazine. A lot of my friends are athletes and are always complaining about how they don't like their daily diets and exercise plan," he said.

How do you get your hands on Stack? The first couple of issues will be distributed free of charge to high schools and universities nationwide, so readers can get a gist of what the magazine offers. After that, the magazine should be printed 10 tomes a year and will be sold by subscription.

Headline: The Tank thrives on guitars and baseball
Author: Luis Nin and Xavier Villarmarzo / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Junior Frank "the Tank" Gonzalez has emerged as the most reliable force from the FIU bullpen this season. 

Gonzalez is second on the team with a 2.55 ERA. He has struck out 25 batters in 24 and two-third innings and pitched and walked only four batters - the least amount on the team. This season, he has compiled an astounding 6.25-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio.

But is there more to Frank Gonzalez than a low number of walks he allowed? The Beacon sat down with him to find out his thoughts on the season, playing guitar, Napoleon Dynamite,  Nessy and Disney princesses.

Q: What is the biggest difference between the team last year and the team this year?

I think this year's team is a lot more mature than last year's. At least the pitchers are, [because we've] got pretty much the same pitching staff from last year.

Q: How does it feel to be the winning pitcher in Coach  Danny Price's historic 1000th win?

It's pretty cool. I guess I'm in the record books now, and maybe I'll be used for a half-time trivia question next year.

Q: There have been three outings this season in which you pitched four or more innings. Why not be a starter instead of a full-time reliever?

I'm comfortable in the bullpen. I like coming in when the game is on the line, and we already have good starters. It's not like we're in dire need for starting pitchers.

Q: You're not an overpowering pitcher, so what do you rely on to get batters out?

Keeping hitters off balance, spotting my fastball on both sides of the plate and being able to throw any pitch on any count.

Q: Which teammate do you admire most and why?

John Banke. He's quiet, goes about his business without bothering anyone, but I think he leads by example and has a solid sense of humor. He's got a very dry humor that keeps us amused.

Q: Finish the following sentence: With a million dollars I would ...

I don't know... probably just get a new truck and a new guitar. That's about it right now. A really expensive guitar, you know.

Q: Finish the following sentence: When I'm on the mound, I feel ... 

I don't feel pressured. Just happy to be there, I guess.

Q: Let's say you could replace your right arm with a futuristic robot arm that could throw a baseball 120 mph and was completely MLB legal but couldn't do things that your regular arm could do, like touch, feel or play the guitar. Would you do it?

Absolutely not! Playing the guitar is an integral part of my life. I couldn't live without it.

Q: What guitarist would you like to trade places with and why?

I would be Kirk Hammett of Metallica because to me, he's the greatest of all time.

Q: Word on the street is that you're pretty good with nun chucks. Ever consider joining a street gang or a clan of ninjas?

(Jokingly) There's a butt-load of gangs around this campus, and one of them tried to recruit me, because I'm pretty good with a bow staff; maybe after baseball.

Q: Who is your favorite Disney princess and why?

I'm gonna have to go with Jasmine. She's definitely the best looking. I tend to favor blondes, but Jasmine's definitely off the chain.

Q: If you were a girl, would you make-out with Frank Gonzalez?

Absolutely!

Headline: Beauty seen through racial minorities' eyes
Author: Yasmine Abellard / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
I recall a time when I adamantly protested to my mother that I would not accept a gift she wished to present to me - a black doll with nappy hair. I felt that it was rather unattractive. 

I was accustomed to receiving the petite, straight-haired, blue-eyed Barbie dolls with sun-kissed skin while living in Haiti. 

When I eventually moved to the States, I noticed how family and friends also emulated the "all-American" image in order to appear whiter, and less black.

I often wonder why, in a country that boasts multifarious faces and skin shades, so many black women uphold the American and Eurocentric ideals of beauty. 

To explore this issue, I interviewed three black women from culturally diverse backgrounds in order to reveal their thoughts on black beauty in America.

Jennifer Petties, a senior majoring in international relations, thinks the typical American beauty resembles a life-sized Barbie doll. The 22-year-old California native attributes this image to growing up in an area where blacks and other minorities were rare. 

Petties, who comes from an African-American and Honduran background, said that the ideals of beauty do not differ much between the black and Hispanic cultures in terms of having westernized features and added that "the lighter the skin, the better." 

"If you're black, you try to whiten the family a little. You want to go for someone that's of lighter skin if you can, just to have it in the family. So when you have your children, your children will be mixed," Petties said.  

Petties admitted to regarding the stereotypical California girl as the epitome of beauty, since it seems that black women are generally considered unattractive in American society. She said, "Growing up, all my friends were white, so what they thought was pretty was white," she said. 

However, she now said that her thoughts on beauty have changed in recent years, especially when she arrived in Miami. 

"It's a lot more multicultural here," said Petties. "You have everything here and essentially in FIU, so there's more exposure to different types of beauty."

Nzinga Mack, a graduate student majoring in ethnobotany, is also aware of the spectrum of black beauty, although she said that beauty ideals vary within the black culture. 

"Some people still have the mind-set that the more white you look the more beautiful you are," said Mack. "Some people still have the mind-set that the pointier the nose, the straighter the hair, the lighter the  skin, the thinner you look, the more beautiful you are." 

Mack, who's had dreadlocks since she was six years old, believes that black beauty is natural and inclusive of dark skin and kinky hair.  

Mack, who grew up in Harlem with what she describes as "Afro-centric parents," said that culture plays a strong role in how one views beauty in black women. 

She also believes that women in the black community are responsible for promoting a more positive image of black beauty within themselves, rather than waiting for external forces to do it for them.

Mack does not believe that there is one prototype of black beauty. 

"I think as we become more progressive, we have a wide variety of ideals of black beauty, whereas back in the day, it was more likely to be one prototype," she said.

Jameelah Shaheed, a sophomore majoring in international business, believes that black beauty is a combination of ideals from African-American and American culture. 

"We're trying to reach that ideal blonde beauty but putting our spin on it. They go for the fair women of their type, and we go for the fair women of our type," Shaheed said.

Shaheed, who is Muslim, added that fair skin is greatly valued not only in black culture, but in various Muslim cultures as well and especially in countries that were colonized. 

Regardless of one's culture, Shaheed believes that beauty ideals of all kinds should not be measured by one's skin tone or body type.

"A woman doesn't have to be the standard of beauty. If she feels she's beautiful the way she is, then people will pick up on that, and that's the confidence that will get you far in life, as opposed to starving yourself and believing you're nothing," Shaheed said.

The ideals of black beauty have evolved somewhat, although it seems that there still exists an underlying Westernized and colonized perception of beauty in black cultures too. 

I have witnessed many of my Haitian, as well as Indian, Asian, Hispanic, African and European friends strive to maintain what they consider to be the American ideal of beauty in various ways - chemically straightening their coarse hair in order to promote a more "civilized" coiffure, bleaching their skin to attain a "fairer" complexion, wearing an assortment of light-colored contacts "for fun," starving themselves to be more "sexy" and even contemplating eye and nose surgery - all in the name of beauty.

As a dark-skinned woman with nappy hair, I have come to realize that beauty is a genuine respect and appreciation for who you are as a woman naturally, minus the artificial flavors. 

All in all, it's about the simple things in life - smiling, laughing and dancing - that simply make you feel beautiful.

Headline: OUR TWO CENTS by Leoncio Alvarez and Alicia Bustamante
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Dear Leoncio and Alicia, 

I've liked this girl since high school. We both go to FIU now but I don't see her as much as I did back when we had classes together senior year. During that year, I thought we were getting pretty close. However, she only thought we were friends, and I never told her that I actually liked her. 

I want to ask her on a real date, but we barely see each other now and have pretty much lost contact even though I still like her a lot. How should I approach her? Should I just tell her how I feel even though we don't see each other anymore?

Thanks,
Another Love Fool

Leoncio says:

Love. It's a tricky business. Even though your situation is a common one, it is a pretty difficulty one to be in. 

I think you should tell her about your feelings. 

You said that your relationship is not as sturdy as it was before so what have you got to lose? 

You either gain a date or lose a friendship that doesn't seem to be very promising if you don't step up. 

Tell her how you feel; she might be thinking the same and just doesn't have the courage to tell you, like you don't have the courage to tell her.

Alicia says:

ALF, sometimes Webster's dictionary can define a situation quite nicely. 

It says that delusion is a false belief held strongly in spite of invalidating evidence. You sir, hold a false belief. 

Girls aren't stupid. She knew you liked her as more than a friend. She just didn't reciprocate for some reason. 

Move on with your life. I would suggest closure versus approaching her and engaging in a painful conversation where awkwardness is king. 

You seem like a nice guy ALF, don't let the past and "what ifs" drag you down.

Subheadline: The history and changes of the Miami-dade county youth fair and exposition
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's that time of year again. The Miami-Dade County Youth Fair is back for the 54th time and so is the inspiration to "BE THERE!" 

The fair opened March 17 and will run through April 3. Behind the estimated one million visitors, incessant amounts of lard-laden food and exhausting advertisements, there is a vast history of which many are not aware.

A brief history of the fair found on www.fairexpo.com describes some of the eminent changes that have been made over the years: "The fair began as a four-day event to showcase the produce, livestock and homemaking projects of 4-H and FFA (Future Farmers of America) students." 

The animals and agriculture are a decent walk from the entrance. Since we live in an area in which crossbreeding cattle is no longer a novelty, those who attend the fair now derive entertainment from rickety rides and foods capable of giving them instantaneous heart attacks. This is one of the alterations to the event over the past 54 years.

Some of the most memorable alterations native Miamians may recall involve the change of the name and location of the fair. In 1952, the first year of the fair, its name was The Southeast Florida and Dade County Youth Fair. At that time, the fair was not associated with Miami-Dade County nor were any tax dollars involved. 

The current location of the fair in Tamiami Park was established with much help from neighboring FIU and a long-term lease agreement with Miami-Dade County, executed in 1972. Although the current established location provides a comfortable place for the yearly event, the first 20 years of the event took place at Camp Tequesta, on US-1 and Kendall Drive. 

A March 2004 press release  stated that the fair provided space and the initial funding, $1.4 million needed to fund the FIU Performing Arts Center, located on the northwest quadrant of the fairgrounds. In 1997, the Performing Arts Center was also used for dance, drama and music competitions.  

Despite the vast changes in the past five decades, the fair is anything but diverse. Sophomore Derrick Mustelier, expressed his displeasure at the lack of variety the fair offers from year to year. "I don't really feel like going because it's the same thing every year, and I'm kind of tired of it already," said Mustelier. 

Regardless of the acute uniformity of the fair's latest annual format, fair attendance can undoubtedly measure the success of the fair. 

The attendance in 1952 was 8,743, while this year, the turnout is expected to be nearly one million. With less than a dozen deaths since the fair has been in operation, the event surpasses the success of most similar events around the United States.

Sophomore Lindsey Donaldson expressed her genuine joy at the fair's arrival. "You just can't beat a night at the fair! The rides, the food and the fact that you can act years younger than you actually are is like being a kid again," said Donaldson.

The true joy of wandering aimlessly through hoards of identical rides and vending areas is priceless. Maybe it's the thrill of possibly adding to the death toll, but it's probably just the elephant ears. My advice when visiting the fair is to pray that you leave alive.

Headline: FIU police uniforms found in dumpster
Author: Rodolfo R. Roman / Police Beat Writer
&nbsp;
According to a police report obtained by The Beacon, officer Andres Falcon reported that on Feb. 13, eight FIU Public Safety logo shirts were recovered. Pressed and still on hangers. Falcon found them in a dumpster located by the rear door of the FIU Public Safety station. In addition to the shirts (sizes 16 and 17), one yellow FIU police raincoat and a pair of dark blue uniform trousers were found in the open, green garbage dumpster. 

The police report stated that the items were strewn about in the dumpster among the discarded files and office content of the assistant vice-president and director for The Department of Public Safety, Jesse L. Campbell.

Falcon stated that the found property represented a "clear and present danger" to the safety of the university community and members of the Department of Public Safety, because anyone could have gained access to the clothes and disguised himself or herself as an FIU officer. 

Falcon noticed the clothes when he returned to the station at the end of his shift. 

"I was on shift from 7 a.m. till 3 p.m., and I saw him - Campbell who retired from his position - in the office at about 2 p.m. He just came in to do the act," alleged Falcon.

Sergeant Doug Ochipa said the Department of Public Safety gives each of its officers five sets of pants and shirts with the FIU emblem. 

"Old-timers don't have their names patched on the uniform. An officer who has been here for a while will use the metal plate name-tag," said Ochipa. 

The items found are valued at $315.

Headline: The Ring 2: New town, same crazy Samara
Author: Nicole Diaz / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
"The Ring" left us with so many unanswered questions: 

How did that tape come into existence in the first place? Could that child actor be any more intense? 

"The Ring 2" also leaves us with unanswered questions. So who thought this movie was a good idea?

Tormented heroine Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) and her son Aiden (David Dorfman) move to Astoria, Ore. in an attempt to forget their history of incidents concerning a certain sketchy videotape. 

Unfortunately, and unbelievably, life is not so easy. After investigating a local story about a dead teen, who sported the signature facial contortion just like everyone else who died at the hands of the tape, Rachel realizes that Samara, the girl whose story is told by the tape, is back to her old ways. 

After Aiden begins to exhibit some suspicious behavior and after they are attacked by a herd of deer, Rachel concludes that Samara wants more than just her story told, and embarks on a mission to find out how she can stop Samara for good and save her son. 

There were two aspects of the original film that made it so outstanding: the mystery and the cinematography. 

The cinematography is still there; this movie is visually as beautiful as the original. But the mystery that kept audiences hungry for answers and horrified by the results is lost in the sequel. 

The moment in "The Ring" when Samara crawls out of the television was so frightening because we had never actually seen her before, and the image was unlike anything we had ever witnessed (we have the fine nation of Japan to thank for that). 

But in this film there is way more Samara than there needs to be. The first time she appears, it's still shocking, but by the last scene, which had the potential to be just as scary as the last scene of the first film, she is, to be completely honest, lame. 

The other problem is that, by now, we know the story all too well. 

The director (Nakata Hideo, who directed the original Japanese versions of both films, "Ringu", and "Ringu 2", but not the American version of the "The Ring") tries to throw in some surprises which are ineffective. 

Most are totally random and confusing, like the deer attack mentioned earlier. 

Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Sissy Spacek as Samara's biological mother. But after some consideration, placing a horror-flick icon like Spacek in that role just seems too contrived.	

The film does deserve some credit, though. The atmosphere is still bleak and somewhat uneasy, which results in some suspense. 

There are still those moments when the puzzle pieces connect and the story is clearer. There are still some completely unexpected flashes of terrifying images that keep you looking over your shoulder. And Aiden is still as intense as ever. 

However, think twice before coughing up nine bucks to see this movie.

&nbsp;
Miami is not known for its waves, but tucked away in the corner of a shopping center just minutes from Biscayne Bay Campus, you'll find Miami's very own hidden wave: It is often overlooked and known only to locals. 

If there's a surf DVD you've longed to see, a board you'd like to check out, a T-shirt or even a sticker you want to place on your car, you can find it all at Island Water Sports.

Like a traveling surfer who finds that perfect, uncrowded wave on a secluded beach far away, many shoppers share that same feeling of bliss when they find Island Water Sports - like they've discovered an oasis in the desert. 

"I love shopping at Island. They always have the coolest clothes and sandals," said freshman Jamie Gurliaccio. 

Store owner Scott Payne takes great pride in the store. Because he grew up near the beautiful beaches of South Florida, Payne has always had a love for the ocean. 

He took up surfing at age 15 and like most, fell in love with it immediately. 

Scott started  working at the store like most wave-starved teenagers in Florida, but his passion for the ocean and his strong work ethic lead him to eventually own his own store in the city he grew up in. 

It's well over 20 years later and Payne has always stayed true to the skate and surf culture and has consistently kept a knowledgeable staff working in his store.

"I've made it a point over the years to always hire people that surf and skate," Payne said. "It's hard at times but it's definitely our customer service and overall knowledge of surfing and skateboarding that has kept us in business for so long."

Whether you're an avid surfer looking for that magic board or someone that's dying to learn, Island Water Sports has something for you. 

The store is also jam-packed with clothing from wall-to-wall. A fully stocked women's and men's department makes it hard not to walk out the door with something you like.

Another aspect of Island Water Sports that makes it so great is its free surf report number. 

Simply dial 305-949-SURF and you'll automatically be plugged into the surf scene. 

The report is updated twice,  every day, to let the surfing community know if there are any waves in South Florida. It's also used as the stores main medium for advertising upcoming sales and local surf parties. 

So the next time you're on your way to the beach or just killing some time in between a class, don't forget about Island Water Sports, where the waves have been breaking in Miami for over 21 years.

Headline: A new take on tradition
Author: Raquel Cool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Grace your kitchen with these homemade variations of popular Asian foods. 

Cupcakes imitating sushi and rude fortune cookies are great excuses to show off your fine eye for culture and your sweet tooth for pastries to your friends.

Sushi cupcakes

 Vanilla cupcakes cleverly disguised as sushi rolls are a sure-fire way to brighten up someone's day. Surprise a friend or treat yourself to these pseudo-Japanese cupcakes.

Before you start, gather up your ingredients. Scour the Internet for vanilla cupcake recipes and a sour cream based frosting. The frosting will also need coconut flakes in it to serve as mock rice.  In lieu of nori (seaweed), use green apple Fruit-by-the-Foot. 

Also, invest in a bag of peach rings. When they're chopped up, they can serve as raw salmon or tofu, depending on which side they're on. 

Don't limit yourself to these ideas. Try orange sprinkles for roe or Swedish fish tails sticking out for a "fish in a rice tomb" effect.

Bake vanilla cupcakes from scratch or from the mix. Once they have cooled, chop their tops off so that each muffin has a flat, sushi-esque surface. Discard or gobble the severed tops. 

Once the cupcakes are flat, they are ready to be frosted. Keep some flakes on the side to apply where needed. 

After each cupcake has been frosted, you can wrap its circumference in Fruit-by-the-Foot. It will stick better if you lightly wet the ends with water. Stick chopped up peach rings in the center of each roll to look like salmon.

The Un-fortune Cookies

 If you are a vulgar opportunist with a sweet tooth, un-fortune cookies may just be for you.  These buttery little capsules of un-poetic slips of poetry have been dubbed "un-fortunate," but that isn't to say that they are not fun to make. So if there is room in your life for fortune cookies that don't come with Chinese takeout, try your hand at making them yourself. 

Here are the ups, the downs and the how-to's of the world of DIY un-fortune cookies.

Before you start baking, you'll need to put on your thinking cap and figure out what your un-fortunes should say. They can be insightful, personalized or downright ridiculous. If you're short on ideas, you can borrow from the pessimistic undercurrent of Hot Topic philosophies. If you "can't sleep because clowns will eat you," by all means, say so.  Otherwise, try inane phrases like, "The ostrich strikes at midnight."

Once you've gathered 20 or so quotes, write them on strips of paper about four inches long and a half of an inch wide. 

Handwritten messages are far more personal, so doodle in cursive if you'd like to.  

Also, you don't need to write on standard, unlined paper. See if you can dig up some wrapping paper and write your messages on the white side. 

This is what you'll need to make un-fortune cookies:  ¼ cup of unbleached all-purpose flour, ¼ cup of white sugar, 1 egg white, ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.

While the oven is preheating to 400 degrees, butter a cookie sheet. Mix the egg white and vanilla until it is foamy, but not stiff. Sift the flour, salt and sugar into the egg white mixture and mix.

Place round teaspoons of the batter at least four inches apart on the cookie sheet. Make sure they are as round as possible; otherwise, the folding will be a little off. 

Also, don't make too many - you will have to fold them while they are hot. Start with two or three to see how many you can do from there.

Let the cookies bake for five minutes or until the cookie has turned a golden color half an inch  from its outer edge. The center will remain pale. Prepare another cookie sheet while the other is baking.

Once it is ready, start by quickly removing the cookie with a wide spatula. 

Place the fortune in the middle of the cookie and fold it in half. 

Now, hold the middle of the folded side against the rim of a measuring cup. With one half in the cup and the other half outside of the cup. Pull the pointed edges down.

Place folded cookies into the cups of a muffin tin or egg carton to hold their shape until firm.  And, voila! You are a carton of stir-fried rice away from your very own restaurant.
