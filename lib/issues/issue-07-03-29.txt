Headline: New center aims to turn students into better writers
Author: Nicole Acosta and Cristela Guerra / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
Students within the School of Journalism and Mass Communication will now have the chance to hone their writing skills with the opening of the school's new writing center.

Dikla Vazana, a junior majoring in advertising, said the writing center, which opened its doors March 1 at the Biscayne Bay Campus, is a necessity for communications students that was long overdue.

"This idea is perfect and should have been thought up a long time ago," Vazana said. "Writing is such an important aspect of any communications major and it really is the foundation which will build our future careers. Writing will make or break you and this center will provide us with information we can actually use to advance in the future."

The $150,000 Scripps Howard Foundation grant will be distributed evenly over the course of three years to the center, which is located in room 303 of Academic II. The grant will provide students with free one-on-one tutoring, small group workshops, literary resources and a weekly online chat room, according to a press release on the SJMC website.

The editing and coaching support within the center will come from SJMC instructors and graduate students, although the only tutors currently working with the center are Neil Reisner, associate professor for the department of journalism and broadcasting, and Kate MacMillin, adjunct professor for the department of journalism and broadcasting.

According to the press release, Allan Richards, chair for SJMC, said the center will particularly help out students who are just beginning their SJMC major by working with tutors to, "work carefully and slowly on a one-on-one level with those professionals."

The grant money will also go to the re-stocking of supplies and general maintenance. Some of the money will also be used to bring in professionals within the communications field to lecture and hold the seminars.

"The center is designed to help students put grammar into action. We are not here to rewrite students' papers. Clients who come to the center will be engaged in discussions on logic, style and technique. This is an exciting new venture for all of us," Richards said in the press release.

Judith Clabes, president and CEO of the Scripps Howard Foundation, said all SJMC students can benefit from the writing center.

"You cannot be a good journalist if you are not a good writer -- no matter whether you are a print journalist, a Web journalist or a broadcast journalist, or a public relations, marketing or advertising professional. Your ability to report, to tell stories, to spread the truth is directly related to your command of the language, your ability to communicate clearly and your ability to write well," Clabes told The Beacon.

According to Richards, the school had two goals, or phases, in mind to improve the writing of its students.

The first phase occurred in 2004 when the SJMC received a $15 million grant to create a revised version of the grammar test.  With the grant, the test that every SJMC student is required to take at least twice in order to enter and exit the school, transitioned to an electronic version.

The second phase, "would focus on the technical aspect…such drawing on the building blocks of grammar but now emphasizing the writing," Richards said in an interview.

In October 2006, Clabes realized the organization's goal by contributing to help SJMC improve its writing. According to Clabes, The E.W. Scripps Company, the foundation's parent company, has networks in Florida, such as the Naples Daily News and WPTV, Channel 5, in West Palm Beach.

"These interests grew out of [the foundation's] strategic decision to invest more resources in schools with significant Hispanic student enrollment," Clabes said.

As a result of the foundation's contacts and interest in Hispanic student enrollment, Clabes visited Richards' classrooms last fall. Richards then came up with the idea of a writing center for SJMC, pitched it to Clabes and she decided to invest in the idea.

MacMillin, aside from serving as a tutor for the center, is also in charge of the center and appointments. She said the center is not a "quick fix center," but rather a place where students can take their time to think about and discuss their writing outside of class.

"Most serious writers would like to have a conversation about their writing outside of the classroom. It's not easy for all students to speak out in class, and it's not always possible for an instructor to have a lengthy conversation with a student about their work in a 45 minute class," MacMillin said.

Vazana said the center is something all SJMC students need in order to become better writers.

"It will resolve any doubts we may have about our own writing skills. We understand that we will not be taught how to write all over again but we will focus on our strengths which will ultimately help us become the best communicators we possibly can," Vazana said.

The center's hours are Mondays 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., Tuesdays 11-1:30 Wednesdays 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and Thursdays 12 p.m. to 2 p.m.  For more information or to make an appointment, e-mail MacMillin at macmilli@fiu.edu.

Headline: Director Spike Lee discusses New Orleans documentary
Author: Carla St. Louis / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
When film director Spike Lee created his HBO documentary When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts, he wanted to show the actual struggle Hurricane Katrina victims experienced "through his lens." 

"It was a very painful experience to see my fellow American citizens, the majority of them African-Americans, in the dire situations they were in. And I was outraged with the slow response of the federal government," Lee said in an interview with www.hbo.com.

This point of view will be the basis of Lee's lecture when he visits the Biscayne Bay Campus  April 4.

FlU's Lectures Committee is so hopeful that their scheduled Spike Lee lecture, An Evening with Spike Lee: America Through My Lens, is going to be a success that they are spending over $35,000 in order to publicize it.

Campus Life and Orientation's Graduate Assistant, Jason Ingrao, who is part of the committee organizing the event, feels Spike Lee is relevant to the FIU community. 

"Every university wants to bring a speaker who represents contemporary issues and current affairs in today's society. We certainly feel [Lee] will be a good image of this," Ingrao said.

The committee was able to schedule Lee as a speaker through the American Programming Bureau, which is an organization that aids in booking guest speakers.

According to Zach Trautenberg, the chairperson of the lecture committee, Lee's appeal is not limited to his career. 

"He's not your typical, laid-back lecturer. He's going to be very outgoing and assertive; he's not going to be boring," Trautenberg said. 

The lecture is organized by the Lectures Committee which is comprised of members from the Student Government Association, Student Programming Council, and Student Organizations Council, and student and staff volunteers.

The School of Journalism and Mass Communication is also collaborating by aiding in promotions and advertisements. 

During his career, Lee has held many titles including writer, director, actor, producer, author and entrepreneur. 

"[He] could apply to a wide range of students by discussing his film career and diversity," Trautenberg said. 

Besides discussing the documentary, others hope  Lee will bring up his usual commentaries on political and social issues.

"[Lee] is one of the pioneering African-American directors and is known for his social commentary; [his work] should inspire discussion from our students and community," said Rafael Zapata, assistant director of Campus Life and Orientation.

The majority of Lee's movies have focused on racially charged topics, such as his movies Malcolm X and Do the Right Thing. 

Born Shelton Jackson Lee, the director is regarded as one of today's premier American filmmakers, according to the American Programming Bureau, which provided a press release to FIU.

The committee expects a turn-out of at least 600 attendees for this event, according to Zapata.

 "Many entities have collaborated to ensure that attendance to this event will be at its maximum potential. We are hopeful that there will be no empty seats left in the room," Ingrao said.

Trautenberg said the lecture will be advertised in local publications via e-mail to all FIU students and to the film departments at the University of Miami and Miami-Dade College.

The event will be held at 7 p.m. in the Wolfe University Ballroom. Tickets are currently being distributed in WUC 141, in room 340 of University Park's Graham Center, and in the Broward Pines Center in room 101. The event is free and open to FIU students and the public.

Headline: My LIFE! EXPERIENCE: Sudden Impact ~ Student reflects beyond the rear-view mirror
Author: Alicia Bustamante / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Franklin Hopkins has been a resident of Southwest Dade for several years. A couple years back, the retired Hopkins had decided one steamy July morning to run some errands in his brand new 2005 Dodge - it was his 69th birthday, after all. Upon turning the corner on SW 128 Street he noticed a car in his rearview mirror approaching him too quickly for comfort. Hopkins observed the car swerve off of the road, pass him on his right (in the grass, no less) and swerve back in front of him before colliding with oncoming traffic. Hopkins attempted to brake, but it was too late, and the impact ruined the front of his car - and most likely his birthday. 

What's worse is that I ruined his car, along with damaging two others in the process. 

Impact is a word we throw around to express anything from painful dentistry to our philosophies about our personal responsibilities in this world. In my case, impact was at 30 mph and I wasn't wearing a seatbelt. 

So, in turn, I broke both my legs (technically, my right ankle was shattered and my left tibia was fractured near the severed ligaments in my knee). But, this isn't a heroine story about learning to walk, although it's true what they say, it's much harder the second time. And it isn't one about seatbelt safety, even though one would have been useful, in retrospect. As for finding Jesus, I'm closer to finding Jimmy Hoffa.

In college, expanding your knowledge - or taking one too many philosophy classes - can make you question your very existence. Do I matter? Does anything matter? Why am I here? Will I be remembered? Usually epiphanies aren't immediate.

To me there are two forms of impact. The first is the way your actions - even in an instant - can affect your future and how that momentary judgment, or lapse of said judgment, can mark your place in someone's memory forever.

Personal accountability is a concept closely tied with this. Thanks to my own guilt, not to mention my mother's daily reminders for the three months I was bedridden, I was aware of the consequences to my actions. Bills piled up, I no longer had a job or a car and was a year behind in my studies. 

As for my impact on others, my recovery had consumed my then-boyfriend's life. In addition, my mother's insurance rates skyrocketed, my absence had opened up two jobs in the market and the loss of my car - the black Honda civic named Gary Coleman - had lowered gas emissions for a split second. Granted, this is taking it to somewhat of an extreme; I know I had at least ruined roughly $25,000 worth of cars.

As one transitions into adulthood, the accountability factor is crucial to maturity. Without it, the "I didn't do it" attitude takes over. 

For some, however, the concept could be scary. Admitting accountability takes the person one step closer to having to deny ever feeling victimized. 

If the person is able to control his or her own actions, then it's certainly possible to control happiness, success and his or her part in a healthy relationship. 

This can also be frightening when one comes to the realization that there is truly no one to count on but yourself and that we all are born and die alone. Ok, another extreme, but my point is made. 

This is an approach I now take to daily life, if only for the fact that I continue to feel the repercussions of that 2-year-old event. I still can't afford a working car, which helped my college career move at a snail's pace. 

And my legs, well, they're screwed - literally.

With that said, I think it's important to make those four or five significant relationships in your life count. Your impact on them insures your existence. 

As for the periphery people in your life, it's important to consider them for karma's sake. I'll probably send Hopkins a 71st birthday card this year.

Headline: Club crunches more than just numbers
Author: Lucia Sastre / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Just around this time every year, many professional accountants put in overtime to crunch numbers from the past tax season. The Accounting Association at FIU, however, aims to keep this energy year-round.

 "Joining the AA is like having a full-time job with all the benefits that will last for life," said member Vanessa Coronado.

Created in 1986, primarily for accounting, finance or MIS majors, the AA focuses on enhancing leadership skills as well as promoting constant involvement in the campus and the community.

For instance, the club conducts mock interviews every semester, which, according to president Krystel Ramos, is a helpful tool for students' performance when seeking employment.

"These mock interviews facilitate a student's chances into getting the job they want," Ramos said.

Furthermore, once a year, selected members of AA are given the choice to travel to different parts of the country in order to attend the Association of Latino Professionals in Finance and Accounting National Convention.

"In these conventions, students learn leadership skills and the art of public speaking. They get to meet with professional entrepreneurs and successful firms, which helps them obtain an insight of the real world," Ramos said.

 Recently, the AA reached a goal of establishing a branch of ALPFA National Honor Society at FIU.

"It is truly remarkable that we were able to create the only Hispanic honors society for business in America. The involvement and dedication that it takes teaches you life lessons that cannot be found anywhere else," said president of ALPFA for the Miami chapter Zameer Uphdya.

Although budget issues might seem like an issue due to the multiple activities taking place, according to Uphdya, there is no need to worry because a scholarship is granted to a student every semester.

"The AA member that is most flexible and involved will most likely be nominated," Uphdya said. "Last semester four students were nominated and the money was shared between the members. It was something we've never done before because usually only one member gets the money, but then again being in the AA helps us come up with solutions to any problem."

Events, such as the Student Organizations Council Club Fair and Business Industry Night aim to give attendees a positive outlook on their job search and prepare them for competition among firms.

The club offers chances for members to meet with prospective members at the beginning of each semester. An event called the Back to School Bash is held in the fall and the ALPFA Annual Convention, their next big event, will be held Aug. 4 - 8.

In business, communication between members is important, even in unlikely locales. For that purpose, volleyball tournaments are held in order to build stronger relationships within the group.

"Although you wouldn't really associate volleyball to business, it is a great way for us to come together in a totally different environment. Every year in these tournaments, we discover something new about each other's personalities," Uphdya said. The next volleyball tournament will be held April 28.

The AA meets Fridays at 6 p.m. in the Graham Center, room 314. During these meetings, important firms and executives are invited to introduce internships and advice on the industry.

On Friday, March 30 at 6 p.m., Grant Thornton International, one of the world's largest accounting firms, will be making a presentation. Anyone that wants to join is welcomed to attend.  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the AA, information can be found at www.fiu.edu/~actassoc. This website also includes applications and contact information.

Headline: UP Library gets new coffee vendor
Author: Charlie Grau / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Sophomore Jenna Hiatt starts her mornings by drinking her usual cup of coffee.

"Every morning, every afternoon, every night; I love coffee," Hiatt said. "It keeps me going."

This summer, coffee lovers at University Park will be able to choose from one more coffee vendor with the opening of another Starbucks, which is currently being built between the entrance and escalators on the first floor of the Green Library.

Java City, currently brews coffee from that spot, and Jonathan Garcia, Aramark resident district manager, said they would continue to do so until Starbucks's grand opening.

According to Garcia, through Aramark's research, they found that Starbucks typically do very well in the library environment.

The library was chosen due to decrease in the amount of students and staff passing through.

"It also adds an additional benefit to the University because it increases gate counts," Garcia said. He was referring to the total number of students that go into library. However, not all students are warming up to the idea of Starbucks replacing Java City.

"I drink coffee from Java City. I prefer family owned or privately owned coffee shops. They have Starbucks everywhere, they're taking over. They're on every corner. They already have a Starbucks in the book store," said sophomore Kacie Makous.

Construction has already begun on the Starbucks and some students have begun expressing their discontent for the new coffee shop. 

A sign posted on one side of the construction site that points students in the direction of Java City was been written anonymously and reads, "Java City is better than Starbucks." 

But Garcia argues that Starbucks has a greater variety of coffees to offer students and staff. He also said that Starbucks will create a more tranquil atmosphere in the library.

Some students, like Tiffany Alley, agree.

"I love their frappuccinos, shakes, pastries, cookies and cakes, even if it's more expensive. Plus Starbucks has more atmosphere," Alley said, who admits she isn't a big coffee drinker.

Besides generating a better return for the University, Garcia said that Starbucks is being added because Student Government Association members on the selection committee requested the change during Aramarks 2005 contract renegotiation with the University.

"This was among one of the many things students requested like the Bustelo Café, pizza, sushi, a new student lounge area and Gracie's Grill," Garcia said. 

Although Starbucks's prices maybe more expensive than Java City's prices, many students believe that it is worth paying the higher price.

"I never heard of Java City," junior Jackie Gadea said. "I prefer Starbucks over any other coffee."

Despite the increased price of a cup of coffee at Starbucks, Garcia said that this in-house venue will emulate street pricing.

"A cup of coffee at Starbucks on the street whether you go to Miracle Mile or you go down 8th Street; the pricing will be the same here," he said. "Aramark doesn't want the students to feel that they are not getting the same value they can get in the street."

Headline: Ceremony recognizes alumni
Author: Camila Martin / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
In an effort to acknowledge the positive work of FIU alumni, the University is celebrating the success of 18 distinguished former students at the upcoming sixth annual Torch Awards Gala.

This year's celebration will take place March 31 and will be hosted by Barry Johnson, president and CEO of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. Other speakers at the event include University President Modesto A. Maidique and Bill Draughon, vice president of alumni relations.

"In a few short years this event has become a tradition among our alumni," Draughon said in a press release. 

The goal behind the annual Torch Awards is to recognize the positive actions of FIU alumni in their profession, community and for the University, said Stephanie Martinez, the alumni relations' coordinator of special events.

"The awards honor alumni for their accomplishments in the community. They have done so much that acknowledging their work also brings good publicity for the University," Martinez said.

This year, recipients will receive a glass hand-made sculpture of a flame during the ceremony as a symbol of their success.

Among the most prestigious of the awards presented at the Gala is the Charles E. Perry Visionary Award, which is always presented to an alumnus or alumna who has made great strides in the early stages of his or her career. 

This year's recipient of the Charles E. Perry award is David M. Callejo Perez, who completed his undergraduate studies in 1993, and then returned to FIU to earn a doctorate degree in education in 2000. He is currently an assistant professor at the department of theory and practice at West Virginia University and is being recognized for starting many educational programs at the university. 

Danny Pino, who graduated in 1995 from the School of Arts and Architecture will be receiving the 2006 Distinguished Award for that school because of his achievements which include a role in the movie The Lost City, directed by fellow former FIU student Andy Garcia, and for his TV show "Cold Case."

"He is one of the most distinguished alumni in this year's ceremony," Martinez said.

Other awards include the FIU Service Award, Community Leadership Award and the Outstanding Achievement Award, among others.

After graduating, students usually keep their respective departments informed of their achievements or in other cases, the department tracks alumni work through the media, and departments base their nominations on this, Martinez said.

Each individual school and college nominates and selects their respective distinguished alumni award recipient and applications are accepted for a two-month period. Then the nominees are announced to the University and to the community.

Once the nominations are completed, the committee is charged with the task of obtaining sponsorship for the event and in selecting of the recipients for five of the six categories. 

Cynthia Dienstag, Alumni Association Board director, served this year as the chair of the award's nominating committee, said Jennifer Restrepo, assistant director for Special Events & Outreach in the Office of Alumni Relations.

In addition, this year, the Torch Awards Gala includes the special guest performance by Andy Señor Jr., an FIU School of Theater alumnus.

Señor will be singing while accompanied by the sounds of a Latin jazz band.

Tickets for the event are $100 and all proceeds will go towards the FIU Scholarship Fund for the two awards given by the Alumni Association: the Panther Pride Scholarship and the Legacy Scholarship.

The awards will start at 6:30 p.m. and will take place in the Graham Center Ballrooms.

Headline: Women's softball swept away at home
Author: Claude Panor / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers (13-24) were swept by the Troy Trojans at University Park Stadium March 24-25 in a three-game weekend series.

"It was a tough series against a good team," coach Kim Gwydir said. "Our players competed; they worked very hard. It just didn't go our way this time." 



TROY 4, FIU 1



In game one of the series, Golden Panthers couldn't seem to get much going. 

"We were hitting the ball right at them," senior centerfielder Deomni Murray said. "We had some looks, but we just kept on hitting the ball right at them."

The first score of the game came on an RBI single to left field by Trojans' sophomore catcher Felicia Hammer that brought home senior infielder Amanda Ragans. Yet the low point of the game came in the top of the sixth inning when junior pitcher Kerri Houck gave up a home run to sophomore outfielder Heidi Johnson of the Trojans. It was the only home run Houck gave up in the series. Houck gave up 10 hits and four runs in seven innings of work.



TROY 2, FIU 1



Rain, wind, more rain and not much scoring was the theme of the second game of a double header played March 24. Heavy clouds appeared to threaten the progress of the game approximately every two innings. Three short rain delays interrupted the game. The last one came in the top of the seventh inning, as the game went into extra innings.

The Trojans made their mark on the scoreboard in the top of the eighth inning. Trojan freshman pitcher Rocky Paige doubled to left-center and advanced to second base. Paige was replaced by a sophomore pinch runner, Kim Kelly, who later advanced to third on a ground out by sophomore catcher Felicia Hammer. Kelly later scored on a wild pitch given up by FIU sophomore pitcher Penny Eastman. Moore advanced to third base and then came home and scored on a collision with sophomore catcher Suzy Ellquist, which gave the Trojans a 2-0 lead. Eastman pitched the entire game giving up four hits and two runs in the loss.

"Our girls fought and played hard. They put it all out on the field," Gwydir said.

Gwydir said that the rain had no effect on her team's performance.

"This is Miami and this is Miami weather," she said. "And we know and expect this type of weather.  Yeah, the delays were in and out, but I don't think that had any affect on our players at all. We are use to this type of weather."



TROY 2, FIU 1



Despite giving up two runs, Houck had more success against the Trojans in the final game of the series going seven innings and allowing two runs.

Senior outfielder Deomni Murray had several highlight moments in this game, one of them being a sensational defensive play in which she chased down a hanging pop fly all the way from her position in deep centerfield to the shallow infield near second base. 

" I am a very aggressive player," Murray said. "On that particular play I saw the ball hanging in the air, and I knew I could get it, so I called for it and caught it."

She also added a stolen base to her team-leading 18 stolen bases. Desiree Fink had a triple in the game, but was later put out on base by the Trojans catcher.

Despite the sweep, Murray and other teammates think that things are beginning to fall in place for the team.

"Keep on being aggressive and things will start falling for us," Murray said. "All we have to do is go out there and continue to execute, continuing working hard just as we have been doing." Coach Gwydir hopes the next time both teams meet, they will flip flop on the box score.

"Our plan is to face them again and to knock them out of the tournament," she said.

Headline: Coke should be kicked off campus
Author: Jose Pagliery / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Given that Florida International University holds one of the highest Hispanic populations in the country at 56 percent, it may be surprising to find that such little attention has yet been given to the movement that seeks to rid Coca Cola as the sole proprietor of soft drinks on campus, but that may soon change.

The "Killer Coke" campaign, led by United Students Against Sweatshops, sheds light on allegations of human rights abuses in Colombia, an issue that at first glance seems to affect Latin Americans abroad.

But despite efforts over recent months to promote awareness, some students have seemed comatose to the issue at hand. 

No questioning, no responses, no pulse. There has existed little debate on either side outside USAS itself, much to the surprise of those who expect FIU to be a spearhead with international issues that relate to our neighbors in the southern hemisphere.

The cause of the silence is disappointing, as many have placed USAS alongside senseless activist groups searching for attention without reading the material. However, the group may have something here.

The claims against Coke show a degree of legitimacy. As reported by the American Anthropological Association in 2004, Coke's bottling plant companies have been in collusion with local right-wing paramilitaries with hopes to dissolve unionizing of factory workers. 

Hired to assassinate union leaders in order to terrorize potential union workers, paramilitaries have murdered eight union leaders and tortured or kidnapped hundreds of workers.

Given that these plants are under Coke's commercial umbrella, many in Colombia consider the company responsible for the implementation of lethal force. 

Surprisingly, Coke refuses to allow for independent investigations of their bottling plants, forcing groups like the AAA to conduct secret interviews with workers who are put at risk by speaking to them in the first place.

In response, Coca Cola was removed from the Broad Market Social Index of KLD Research and Analytics Inc. on ethical grounds. 

The highly respected TIAA-CREF, a $380 billion financial services group, then banned the company from their Social Choice Account.

To call USAS "radicals" as some have is a misnomer. The issue at hand shows a measure of validity - making SGA's refusal to give the issue sufficient attention even worse.

Despite continuous efforts on the group's part to work with SGA, much has failed. Both agreed to form a joint committee to investigate the claims, but the few representatives who agreed to assist the group have shown little interest in the matter.  

Considering the significance of the claims against the company that provides all of FIU's soft drinks, one would hope the matter would be given much more consideration.

But while University administrators have yet to pay attention to the issue at hand, it is SGA who holds the responsibility to help students communicate with those in charge-something not being done. 

Despite a 600-signature petition and multiple public presentations, USAS has yet to meet with administrators. 

Their requests are both fair and justifiable: investigate the matter, and if something is found, make the ethical decision and switch soft drink sponsors. 

To say that switching sponsors takes away the consumer's freedom of choice ignores the fact that there was no freedom to begin with - FIU is a Coca-Cola campus.

But the time to deal with this issue in an acceptable manner is running out. Trying various channels of communication, the group has found nothing but a dial tone on each. 

They have been waiting patiently for months, but pushing against the current has been wearing their patience thin. It may be in the interest of administrators to deal with the issue before it lands on their doorstep, and it is SGA's responsibility to bring them the message.

Headline: Editorial: New Starbucks: a good idea gets a bad location
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Making good on students' requests for better coffee on campus, Aramark, the company responsible for all food vending on the University Park campus, is replacing the small Java City booth on the first floor of the Green Library with a big Starbucks. Student government requested the change - along with adding pizza, sushi and a Café Bustelo venue in the Graham Center - during Aramark's 2005 contract renegotiation with FIU.

Some students have expressed their discontent with the change, arguing that they prefer buying their coffee at smaller, privately owned coffee shops over large, corporate chains like Starbucks. There are two holes in that argument, though: for one thing, Java City isn't a small, local shop. Like Starbucks, it's also a large, corporate chain with locations in several countries. It's just not as successful - or ubiquitous - as its competitor. Besides, the argument for supporting local coffee shops usually goes that the local joints are quainter and homier, and that they're, well, better. Java City, or at least the one in the Green Library, is neither. The Java City locations at both UP and the Biscayne Bay Campus are stark and generic, not quaint and cozy. And as far as quality goes, the Java City in the library offers a meager selection and is closed half the time. It's no wonder students asked that it be replaced.

In contrast, it's a sure bet that the Starbucks that's replacing it will have no shortage of double mocha grande skim chai lattes. Hopefully, it will also be open longer and more consistently than the vendor it's replacing.

That said, the new Starbucks isn't exactly a dream come true. It's good that FIU is bringing a vendor students like. It's not so good they're doing that by planting the mammoth franchise in the middle of the library's main floor. Whoever cooked up that idea seems to have forgotten it's a library we're dealing with here, not a strip mall.

Once the Starbucks is built, the first thing students will see when they walk into the library is a hulking beast of a coffee shop. Blueprints for the venue estimate its size at just under 1,400 square feet. To get to the escalator - you know, to go up where the books are - will mean a trek around the venue. For a library, a smaller, less obtrusive, more discreet venue would have been more appropriate. A Starbucks just as big and flashy could still be a good idea, just not smack in the middle of the first floor. There's a covered patio area just outside the library where the Starbucks could have fit just fine, without subverting the library's primary purpose. 

Finally, it's not clear that UP really needs a third coffee shop, especially so close to the other two places on campus. There's already a Starbucks in the Bookstore and a Café Bustelo in GC. Both are a two-minute walk from the library at worst. Given that a large coffee shop could be potentially disruptive for those students who actually go to the library to study, Aramark would have done well to put the new Starbucks elsewhere.

Headline: 'Mr. Friday' setting his sights on the big leagues
Author: Adam Wasch / Contributing Writer

Golden Panther junior pitcher Chris Allen's (1-3) domination of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights on March 10 led to him being named Sun Belt Pitcher of the Week. Allen recorded twelve strikeouts, held Rutgers to one earned run and became the first Golden Panther to pitch a complete game since April 21, 2006.

Allen credits the 4-2 Golden Panther victory to the team's defense and the coaching staff's unorthodox training regimen.

"I had great defense behind me, and that made my job a lot easier," Allen said. "We put in a lot of extra work mechanics-wise before the series and the coaches had us come in early and do yoga. All that is starting to pay off."

Born in Williamsport, Pa., a mecca for little leaguers around the world, Allen has found success on every level of baseball. 

Allen flourished at South Williamsport High School. He was named the Mid-Penn Conference Pitcher of the Year during his junior and senior years, and he earned first-team Mid-Penn Conference honors as a pitcher and catcher in his senior year.  

The accolades bestowed upon Allen caught the attention of Major League Baseball. The Florida Marlins selected Allen in the 45th round in the same 2003 draft that produced a crop of young prospects, such as Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks and Washington Nationals closer Chad Cordero.

"I can't even put into words how great a feeling it was to get drafted while at home with my parents and my brother, the most important people in my life," Allen said. "To be able to have an honor happen with those kind of people around you is something real special and something that I'm hoping to experience again."

Allen ultimately ended up honing his skills at Lake-Sumter Community College, where he earned Academic All-Sun Coast Conference honors in 2004.

After shoulder surgery, he transferred to Clemson where Tigers head coach Jack Leggett had high hopes for the junior college transfer. However, after one season with the Tigers, Allen decided it was time to move on.

"I wasn't 100 percent sure where I fit in at Clemson, so I contacted [Golden Panthers assistant] coach Casas," he said.

"The more I talked to each coach at FIU, the more it seemed like a real good fit and a great place to play."

In his first seven starts this season, Allen is holding steady as a mainstay in the Golden Panther starting rotation.

"Chris is getting better with every start," senior third baseman Bryan Pullin said. "He should be our 'Mr. Friday Night' guy. We need him."

With Sun Belt Conference action heating up, Allen keeps a modest and focused attitude approaching one game at a time.  

"You can't go about it any other way," Allen said. "You are only as good as your last game. I just have to perform and do my best to help this team."  

If Allen can build upon starts like the performance against Rutgers and become "Mr. Friday Night" against Sun Belt Conference opponents, then success is in store for the Golden Panthers baseball team.

Headline: Volleyball coach finds success despite war's impact on life
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Asst. Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Society has frowned upon her being a professional athlete, her family was torn apart by war, and she managed to adapt to a new foreign land she now calls home. Yet women's volleyball coach Danijela  Tomic still kept her passion for the game she loved.

"Volleyball was always my passion," Tomic said. "I remember the first time I saw a volleyball team and from that moment I knew that was what I wanted to do."

Tomic began her career as a volleyball player in Kakanj, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Her success during her time playing in junior clubs led her to be invited to play for a more prestigious team located in Croatia. The team was in an elite league called the First National League, and Tomic was invited to join when she was 16 years-old.

She left the small hometown of Kakanj on her own, but her parents believed their teenage daughter could live on her own.

"My parents trusted I was mature enough to finish high school while playing for the best club in Croatia," she said.

Tomic's decision to leave her hometown was also influenced by her desire to study physical education. Although Croatia provided more educational opportunities than her hometown of Kakanj, Tomic's education would be limited by staying in Europe. 

In Europe, athletics and academics are two separate entities. Europe's schools do not provide athletic programs for students. Therefore, young athletes participating in sports clubs are discouraged from receiving an education.

"It's not in their [sports clubs] interest for athletes to go to school," Tomic said. "They don't care about your academics."

During her playing career in  Croatia, the political situation in Bosnia would leave her family separated in four different cities. The Bosnian War of 1993 destroyed the lines of communication between Tomic and her family. Her mother and sister were in Bosnia, her father and sister were in Croatia and her brother was in another region of Croatia.

They were not able to see each other for one year, but they were fortunate to be able to send letters to each other and talk on the phone once a week. 

Tomic continued to play volleyball and go to school during the war. When the year eclipsed, she was reunited with her family, but she could barley recognize her mother.

"I had never seen her so skinny before," Tomic said. "We were all so relieved to see each other and I was grateful nobody in my family died."

Tomic played on junior and senior national teams before moving to the United States because of a scholarship provided by the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. She was 23 years-old when she arrived to the United States and she learned English quickly due to classes and other unorthodox methods practiced in Europe.

"Luckily in Europe, we watch many American movies, and we read the subtitles," Tomic said.

After graduating from UALR in 1999 with a degree in health education, she was an assistant coach for six years at UALR, an assistant coach in Louisiana State University for two years until filling the head coaching job at FIU in 2005.

As head coach she needed an assistant, so she hired fellow Croatian and UALR alumna, Tanja Eckart. They were both teammates at UALR, but their friendship goes back to Croatia. 

Eckart had looked up to Tomic in Croatia as a player, and told her that she too wanted to go to the United States. Tomic promised she would call Eckart when she reached the United States. One year later, Tomic and Eckart were e-mailing each other consistently.

"She was my first mentor, sister and coach throughout college," Eckart said. "She keeps her word."

Tomic said experience at UALR shaped her into the coach she is today. UALR's volleyball head coach, Von Compton, was Tomic's first female coach. She had always been coached by men throughout her whole career. Tomic says Compton was also the first coach, who wanted her to graduate and who cared about her as a person.

"She helped me develop my coaching philosophy," Tomic said. As FIU's head coach, Tomic has made an effort to show her players that she does care about them. Setter Keila Oliveira's mother is suffering her second battle with cancer. 

Oliveira supports her mother, who lives in Brazil, financially. Aware of the problem, Tomic helped organize a volleyball tournament, that will help raise money for Oliveira's mother cancer treatment. The tournament is set to take place on April 14 at the Pharmed Arena.

"Last semester and this semester has been the most difficult time of my life and she has been a great support," Oliveira said. "She came up with the idea that she could talk to some administrators to see if we could do a tournament to raise some money."

Tomic had been trying to organize the tournament since last semester. She was not allowed to hold the tournament at first, but she persisted to seek administrators' approval.

"I encountered many people who didn't believe I would be successful in the next level," Tomic said. "There's no limit to what a person can do, if he or she has a passion for it."
