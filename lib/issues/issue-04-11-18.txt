Subheadline: "Appointed for life" supreme court rule has been overlooked far too long
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist remains seriously ill with thyroid cancer, and now, with the elections over, it is likely that the 80-year-old will step down, allowing what many speculate will be another strong conservative judge to be appointed to the court and a moderate conservative to take his place as chief justice. 

However, with the current average age of the supreme court at 70-years-old, there are concerns that the mental competency of the justices and relevance of the supreme court system may be fading.

For instance, while Rehnquist was never quoted as saying so, many hypothesized that he would refuse to step down until he knew the results of this past presidential election. Many also speculated that he would have chosen to remain chief justice even in his poor health and old age, if a democrat had been elected.

Had this occurred, it would have set a strange precedent on what should be a non-partisan, balanced final word in justice. It is inevitable that with age comes deterioration in mental and physical health, and because there are no standard tests for such conditions, it is plausible that the view of a completely competent and fair court could become tainted.

Perhaps it is a good time to review the antiquated "appointed for life" rule. There are many situations where this rule may not be useful anymore.

Headline: Men's soccer headed to NCAA tournament
Author: Nikolay Orekhov / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Two days after a brilliant performance and win against the No. 14 Hartwick, which enabled the Golden Panthers to clinch the conference title and earned the automatic bid into the NCAA tournament, FIU lost its season finale at South Carolina on Nov. 14.

The 3-1 loss snapped the team's five-game winning streak and improved the Gamecocks' all-time series record to 5-0-1 against the Panthers.

With the loss, the Golden Panthers finished the regular season with an 11-6-0 overall record. The Gamecocks improved to 12-6-1 for the season.

South Carolina took an early 1-0 lead in the sixth minute of the match and never looked back, going ahead 3-0, before FIU scored its lone goal of the game. 

Gamecocks' Freshman Sebastian Lingholm scored his sixth goal of the season in the winning effort; juniors Ryan Deter and Eric Szeszycki added a goal each to combine for the South Carolina score.

FIU senior Fernando Plentz scored his seventh goal of the season during the 71st minute to break up the shutout. Shawn Crowe of FIU and South Carolina's Brad Guzan each recorded three saves for the match.

Although, the outcome of this game had little effect on the Panthers' tournament hopes, it ended the longest winning streak of the season. 

At least the good news despite the loss, is that the Golden Panthers' new season goes into full swing Nov. 19, when their quest for the NCAA Championship gets underway. 

"We're thrilled to be back in the NCAA Tournament again," said head coach Karl Kremser.

The Golden Panthers will face a familiar opponent in the University of Central Florida this Friday at 7 p.m. The game will be at the FIU Soccer Stadium, and it is going be the third consecutive year that the two teams will square off against one another in the first round of the tournament. 

"It seems to be a tradition to play them in the first round,"  Kremser said.

The Golden Panthers won six straight versus UCF and hold a 23-6-3 all-time series advantage over the Golden Knights. 

"We got a win over them earlier this year, but we need to be ready to play them again," Kremser said.

Headline: Women's basketball look to rebound from losing season
Author: Andres Cordero / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Since its 1975-76 inaugural season, the FIU women's basketball program has established a winning tradition second to none in FIU athletics.  During the span of 29 years the Golden Panthers amassed 22 consecutive winning seasons, 17 20-win seasons and 13 postseason tournament appearances, while piling up 535 total wins along the way.  

Now, putting aside the disappointment of an atypical 11-16 campaign in 2003, head coach Cindy Russo and the women's basketball team are prepared to tip off the new season on Nov. 19.

Coach

The Golden Panthers have won 516 of 535 victories under head coach Russo. All of the team's 20-win seasons and 13 postseason appearances have come in the past 26 years: The Russo Era. 

The 13th winningest active coach in NCAA Division I women's basketball has high hopes for this year's squad and believes that this season will be an improvement over the last.

"We're going to do better than last year," said Russo. "We played some good basketball, but we didn't get enough wins. We have more home games this season, and we have a lot of players returning. They have grown and matured, and with a tough preseason, we will be ready."

Front Court

One of only two seniors returning from last year's team is forward/center Milena Tomova. The 6-foot-3 Bulgarian native received All-Sun Belt Conference honors after leading the Golden Panthers with an average of 16.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.2 blocks and 1.6 steals per game in 2003-04.

Tomova had a breakout season as a junior, earning a spot on the all-tournament team in all four of the tournaments in which FIU competed.

Her nine double-doubles were a team high, and she ranked second in the conference in free-throw percentage, third in blocks, fourth in points, fifth in rebounds and sixth in field goal percentage.

"[Milena] has gotten better over the summer," said coach Russo. "I'm looking for her to dominate in every statistic, both on the team and in the conference. She is going to be a player to contend with on everyone's scouting report."

Her athleticism and strong fundamentals allow her to play at both center and power forward. 

Both options can open up some playing time for the Latvian twosome of sophomore centers Lasma Jekabsone and Liene Bernsone.

At 6-foot-3 Jekabsone is one of the tallest players on the team. She has a good low post-game and can be one of the premiere post players in the conference, according to Russo. 

Bernsone saw action in 13 games last year and will play limited minutes behind her fellow natives of the former Soviet Bloc.

Newcomers Shantel Ragin and Jasmine Jenkins may both see some time at the forward position. Both freshmen were tri-athletes in their respective high schools, competing in basketball, volleyball and track & field. 

Jenkins stands 6-foot-2 and was a highly coveted recruit out of Augora High School in California. The 5-foot-7 Ragin played at Flannigan High and has the versatility to play guard as well forward.

Back Court

The other returning senior is 5-foot-8 guard, Deniz Boz who led the Golden Panthers to a Sun Belt Conference title in her sophomore year.  

When Ivelina Vrancheva graduated, the Turkish born Boz was expected to move back into the starting point guard position but an ACL injury has ended her season. The senior also missed the 2002-03 season due to a torn ACL.    

Before the injury, Russo was expecting Boz to lead the team.

"Deniz is one of our hardest-working players," said Russo. "We won the Sun Belt Conference when she was our starting point guard, and she wants to lead the team back there."

Junior Faeza Bouderra is expected to see more time on the hardwood than she did last year, when she averaged 15.9 minutes per game. Sophomores Asha Neal and Eva Makela will add depth at the guard spot. 

Meanwhile, second year freshman LaQuetta Furgason and newcomers Iva Ciglar and Ashley Painter will contribute to a team that ordinarily has had the luxury of setting the attainable goal of winning the Sun Belt Conference and advancing to post-season play.

This year the Golden Panthers will play 17 of the 27 regular season games at home where they hold a dominating 233-48 record over visiting opponents. 

The Golden Panthers will see their first action of the year  when they host the Traveler's Tournament, Nov. 19-20 at Pharmed Arena. The game can be heard live on Radio Golden Panther, 88.1 FM.

Headline: "Can't back down" mentality expected from center Burnett
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
With homecoming past us, Thanksgiving approaching, and football season coming to an end, there is only one thing left in the year: the start of basketball season. 

With a new coach, a new team outlook and a heavy schedule, this season appears to be one for the ages. The Beacon met with team leader and senior Byron Burnett and discussed a little bit of everything, from his career to the team's performance.  

Q: On your biography it states that you did not play basketball in high school. Did you play at all before attending Southern Union College? 

Kind of but not really. I played from time to time when I was younger. It was always kind of like one of those situations where I was the big guy around, so people would pick me to play. I basically started playing my freshman year [at Southern Union College].

Q: You were recruited out of junior college by the University of Mississippi, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and other programs. What made you decide on FIU?

I took a visit here, and I took a visit to Ole Miss, but I just wanted to be in a different situation. I like the environment down here the best and the diversity. That's why I chose to come down here. 

Q: What do you wish to accomplish personally during your final season? What about for the team?

Personally, just to be the best team player, do what I got to do, sacrifice for the team. Team wise, I would like to see a conference championship and hopefully go to the tournament if we play hard and work hard everyday. 

We have to take every game one at a time and not get ahead of ourselves. 

Q: You became a huge presence in the middle last year, leading the team in several defensive categories. What was the most important thing you learned during your junior season?

Never quit; we had a bad season last year, and we just have to keep going. A lot of guys wanted to quit. Never quit no matter what happens. Life is like a rollercoaster; it's going to go up and down. It's a journey and you can never quit no matter how much you lose. 

Q: What are the big games that stand out in your mind this season?

I feel as though every game is a big game. The conference games are the most important. The game against Miami is a big game for us. The game against University of Connecticut is a big game, and Florida State but the conference games are the most important, especially the ones leading up to the conference championships. 

Q: You play at defending champions UCONN at the end of the month. What are you looking to pull out of that game?

We have got to play our game. We can't back down. It doesn't matter whether they are number seven or eight in the nation. 

We have to play smart defense and rise to their level. We can't back down, because it will give us a lot of experience heading into our conference schedule. 

They are strong. They have the number one in the top 25, and it will give us experience playing against good players. Playing teams like UCONN and Florida State and good teams like Miami and George Washington, will only help us. 

Q: The team has been ranked fifth in the preseason conference poll. Do you think that position is justified or is there something lurking around that no one knows about?

That is because we came in last place last year. We only won one conference game. We don't really read [into] that. They are going to say what they are going to say. We have to come out and show them something. 

Hopefully, we will be better than last year. We are not reading that. They can say what they want to say. They don't really know what we have down here, but they will. 

Q: This is coach Sergio Rouco's first season. How have things changed since last season?

We have changed our attitude. We can't back down. We [have to] work hard and finish our job. Everybody is being on time. He is teaching guys for the long term situation in your life. Just be on time. Be strong, and be together. The team is more together. We are a more humble team, a kind of family situation. Everybody feels comfortable with each other. This is going to be a different story, a different situation for years to come.

Headline: Volleyball ends sour season on disappointing note
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers volleyball team ended its season in heartbreaking fashion with a 3-2 loss to the Trojans of Arkansas-Little Rock on  Nov. 14 at Pharmed Arena. 

FIU finished the season with a disappointing 3-23 overall record and was 2-12 in Sun Belt Conference play. 

The Golden Panthers were down 2-0 despite having a chance to win both those games. The team came together and took advantage of the Trojans mistakes to tie the match. Ultimately, however, they lost the decisive fifth game.

"We fought hard, as if we were trying to not let the season go," said captain Laura Vogel, referring to the effort put forth by the team in their final match of the season. "It's been rough for us, but we're always looking forward."

The match marks the last for seniors Danielle Dubetz, Jessica Jones and Myriam Rodney, who have all played valiantly this season despite all of the team's setbacks. 

Dubetz finished on a high note recording a career-high 10 kills and a season-high seven total blocks. Jones joined contributed with a season-high 11 digs.

Sophomore Oksana "The Iron Curtain" Zabalueva led FIU offensively with 16 kills, four aces and five blocks. Junior Laura "The Crane" Vogel added a double-double with 10 kills and 10 digs as well as seven total blocks.

Freshman Dyionna Smith also had her own double-double with 28 assists and 13 digs. Junior Anna Dmowska contributed with 13 kills and four blocks. Both women played in only four matches.

In a thrilling Game One, FIU had game-point with 29-27 lead but allowed four consecutive points to ultimately lose 31-29. 

Game Two featured an equally thrilling yet heartbreaking finish. In a game that featured 18 tie scores, FIU had a 28-25 lead but allowed four consecutive points again. The game became a seesaw battle, ending with a 34-32 win for the Trojan. Freshman Ruth Fleming led the way for FIU with six kills. Vogel and Dmowksa added five kills apiece. 

In game three, the Golden Panthers did not want to be swept. Despite having UALR score 10 consecutive points in the middle of the game, FIU clawed their way back to a 30-24 victory by scoring 11 of the last 12 points.

Game Four was much of the same for UALR, as they had 11 errors for the second consecutive game. FIU took advantage of them by taking a 12-11 lead and never looking back. For the game, Dmowska had four kills and Jones contributed with six digs.

In game five, FIU took an early 5-3 lead only to see it vanish off six straight points from the Lady Trojans. UALR managed to carry that momentum to a 15-10 win.

The Golden Panthers return all but three players next season and hope a veteran team will improve this season's record.

Headline: Women's cross country finishes strong at regional
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Another season is in the books for the FIU Cross Country team, with this year ending on a high note. 

Golden Panther sophomore Amanda Howard, who led the FIU ladies all year round, once again put in a solid performance in the final race of the season. 

By running a 22.25 during Saturday's six kilometer NCAA South Regional in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Howard posted the second best women's time in FIU history. 

Howard finished in 43rd place, eclipsing her best time in the 6K by 51 seconds - a personal record she set at the same meet last year. Her 43rd place finish is also the second best place any runner has achieved at the regional meet in the school's 32-year history. 

Freshman Deidra Witherspoon finished with a time of 23.51, the second best time ever in the 6K by an FIU freshman. Not to be outdone by her teammates, Paola Reategui continued the success of this year's squad by also adding her name to the record books, finishing with the third best time for a freshman at 24.11. 

Witherspoon and Reategui finished 109th and 119th, respectively, out of a field that featured 163 runners. 

Apryl Wall finished fourth on the team with a time of 25.07, good enough for 149th overall. 

The meet was dominated by two schools from the SEC, Tennessee and Georgia, who finished just two points apart. The lady Volunteers edged the lady Bulldogs 78-80. The University of Chattanooga edged out ACC front runner Florida State for third place. 

Sophomore Angela Homan of Auburn University won the meet with an overall 6K time of 20.25, less then two seconds in front of runner-up Shannon Wommack from the University of Chattanooga.  

On a high note for the Golden Panthers, all of the runners that were featured on this year's roster are either sophomores or freshmen. 

This means that unlike every other school in the Sun Belt Conference, all of their runners will return next season as they chase the Sun Belt crown.

Headline: RA's regulation demonstrates hypocrisy
Author: Jon Banke / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
While presidential campaigning was in full swing in Oct., my roommates and I decided to display a sign outside of our apartment supporting our candidate. 

Like many FIU students, we wanted our feelings to be known as to which candidate  we wanted in the Oval Office. For two days our sign was proudly displayed on our balcony railing. Others in the University Park Apartments  also displayed signs supporting their chosen candidate.

On the second night that our sign was displayed, Resident Advisors on a routine evening patrol came to our door and asked us to remove it. We asked why,  and they gave us two reasons. We completely disagreed with both but were forced to comply against our will. 

The first reason was that our railing had to be available for people to use. Who uses our railing except for us? It is directly outside our door on the second floor, and the actual handrail on the frame was completely clear of any obstructions, including signs.

 We had an even bigger issue with the RAs' second reason for having us remove the sign - the possibility of it becoming litter. We considered this to be  a double standard. Our sign was a problem, but our RA is allowed to post flyers, promotional leaflets and other information all over our building at will?

 Just days after being told that our heavy-duty, weatherproof sign was a litter problem, our RA posted over 50 flyers promoting an event to be held in our courtyard all over the outside of our building. 

Flyers were stapled to our courtyard table, pinned to our trees and laundry room walls and, of course, taped to our doors and balcony handrails. 

The over 50 residents in our building each received an invitation to the event on top of all of the promotional flyers outside the building.  Even with all of this information distributed to residents, attendance was mediocre at best.

Material is distributed every week around the apartments, encouraging residents to become active in campus life, reminding them of important deadlines and promoting events that the housing administration oversees. 

With all of the weather we can get at any time in South Florida, frail pieces of paper present no match for mother nature and are often found laying in the grass or around the courtyard. Every morning our poor custodial workers, already burdened with so much, face cleaning up more and more flyers and leaflets. Though they do a phenomenal job, they are not able to pick up every piece of trash scattered around the building.

Our problem is not with our RA or hosting events in housing facilities. We get along with our RA just fine and enjoy the multiple activities RAs plan for students who live on campus. 

The issue is that housing officials don't see loose-leaf promotional material and other such information as potential litter, while they snuff out a heavy-duty sign enticing individuals to be active in our flourishing political process as quickly as possible. 

When we questioned housing officials about their policies and reasons behind this decision, a simple shrug of the shoulders was the only answer we ever received. For the amount of money we pay to live on campus, a more complete and clear answer about posting signs and information and distributing flyers would seem to be the next obvious step. 

However, to this day, nothing has been said or done to ease the confusion.

Headline: University mourns death of couple
Author: Luis Nin / Illustrator
&nbsp;
From The Miami Herald to the Sun Sentinel and CNN, the death of two prominent FIU students-Pi Kappa Phi President Tony Perez and Phi Sigma Sigma member Janelle Bertot-became news that quickly spread around the country.

On the morning of Nov. 14, Perez and Bertot, a sophomore majoring in premedicine, were found dead in his 1993 Mercury Villager. A Broward County sheriff discovered the vehicle in a Weston mini-mall parking lot.

The Broward County Medical Examiner's Office declared their cause of death to be carbon monoxide intoxication. The odorless gas acted as a subtle and lethal poison.

Word of the discovery quickly made its way to FIU, where Greek Affairs held a meeting that afternoon to inform the Greek community of the deaths. Over 200 students attended the meeting, which consisted of an information session and a moment of prayer.

The department then cancelled the fraternity and sorority homecoming awards ceremony and  the week's intramural games.

Perez's and Bertot's friends and peers have spent time sharing their memories and accomplishments.

"They were both very amicable, very caring. They were heavily involved. They touched people," said Karen Katz, assistant director of Campus Life for Greek Affairs. 

Bertot was 19-years-old and an active member of Phi Sigma Sigma, FIU's first sorority. She was the Alumnae Chair of the organization's executive council. Among her many accomplishments, Bertot had submitted a proposal to President Maidique regarding the establishment of sorority houses on campus and served as a morale captain during FIU's all night Dance-a-Thon charity event.

"Janelle had such stature about her. She was someone everybody wanted to confide in, very mature for her age. She was so brilliant and full of potential. You could tell she was going to succeed in any area of life," Katz said.

Tony Perez was 25-years-old and scheduled to graduate in December. Known for his public support of Delta Lambda Phi, FIU's only gay fraternity, those who knew him remember him as a student full of conviction.

"When I think of Tony, I think of someone with integrity. He lived his values; he lived his life the way you should. He was a great man. He always had a smile," Katz said.

Memorial services were held on Nov. 15 for Perez and on Nov. 16 for Bertot. On Thursday, Nov. 18, there will be a candlelight vigil by the Graham Center Fountain at 7:30 p.m.

During the day, there will be two poster boards on display by the GC Pit on which students can post pictures or write messages. 

The greek organizations will present the posters to Perez's and Bertot's parents later that evening.

Headline: SPOTLIGHT ON UP SGA PRESIDENT
Subheadline: UP SGA President
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
Standing in front of his peers, University Park Student Government Association President, Jorge Rosario, raises a gavel and asks the council to have a seat. 

The council sits and watches as Rosario bangs the gavel and announces the commencement of the meeting. 

Mid-term into his presidency, Rosario heads each weekly meeting of council members, ready to present their organization's accomplishments. Rosario opens the meeting, looks up at the members in front of him and says, "Welcome my friends." And, that's how he likes it. 

"Motivation is a key ingredient in keeping the council ready and able to get the job done. The meetings help us focus on the task at hand," Rosario said.

Along with UP SGA Vice President, Malik Wilkes, students elected Rosario under a slew of controversy after his opponent, David Medina, heard speculations of Rosario's disqualification from the race. 

Rumors about Rosario, Wilkes and their campaign spread like wildfire all over UP. Medina insisted that a board of elections member had leaked confidential information stating that the Rosario, Wilkes campaign had broken election rules such as stealing signs and defaming opposing candidates. Although gossip and a two-hour sit-in before Patricia Telles-Irvin, the former Vice President of The Student Affairs Office, were the results of this election controversy, Rosario was not around to witness it all. 

Carried off by his fraternity brothers and thrown into the UP Apartment's lake - a traditional "winner's ceremony"- Rosario stood misty-eyed in front of his campaigners and thanked his FIU family for their support. 

"I want to thank all of you for helping me win this election. You are all like family to me," said Rosario, following his presidential win. "We did it together and I look forward to serving you in the upcoming year."

According to Rosario, the win proved that hard work pays off. He maintained that he made a conscious effort to enjoy himself and celebrate a victory that he felt he deserved.

"In every election there is always controversy and speculation about things that happened and didn't happen. I was fully aware of what my [campaigners] were doing and not doing," said the SGA president who became involved with the organization in 2001. 

Born into a working class family, Rosario related that his parents are an extraordinary pair whose constant commitment to the family has shown him what it takes to lead a successful life. His mother was born in Guam, a small U.S. territory in the Pacific Islands, and met his father, a Cuban-American Air Force soldier, when he was stationed on the island. After the birth of Rosario's older sister, the new family moved back to the continental U.S. Two years later, his parents had Jorge and his younger brother, Javier.

Loyal to his family, Rosario recounted having to leave school and work full-time to support them and put his younger brother through school.  

"It was a tough time, but I knew what I had to do. It was my turn to take some responsibility," Rosario said. "I grew up with a tight family bond, and I always held a respect for how much my parents worked for the family."

According to Rosario, this was a very trying time that made him realize the importance of family values and a strong work ethic. 

When he returned to school, Rosario said that his biggest challenges were trying to keep up and stay involved.  

"Personally, my challenge has always been allocating enough time to do this position. I am the typical FIU student in that I have always had to work full-time. I have always had to support myself," Rosario said.

Rosario's work ethic and family are not the only things that keep him going. According to Wilkes, Rosario can do anything he sets his mind to.

"With anything he does even outside of FIU, you know [by how he works] that he is doing it. When he puts his passion and drive into something...it comes out," Wilkes said. "You can tell that he cares, and he knows what he is doing. He gives off this energy that is unexplainable."

Now, six months into his presidency, the 24-year-old says that he has enjoyed his time as president and is still enthusiastic about what he has yet to accomplish. 

"I became a president because of my love for dealing with people. [Being president] is everything I thought it would be and more," Rosario said. "It is a lot of work and a lot of time, but it is a dream come true for me.  I am doing as much as I can each day."

During his presidential campaign in April 2004, Rosario  made promises to students and some say that he will keep them. 

"Each president comes with their own set of goals...some extremely ambitious and others want to chart new paths. Jorge is mot­­­­­­­ivated by making things better for students around him," said Vicky Owles, assistant director for Campus Life. "I know that he wants the FIU experience to be a positive one for his council and the students that he serves."

Rosario has also managed to keep conflicts with the Biscayne Bay Campus to a minimum - a feat few of his successors have been able to accomplish. 

"We have a great working relationship. Jorge and I are in constant contact with each other," said BBC SGA President Ruth-Allyson Webster.

Rosario credits open communication with SGA's success this year. 

"In the past, there was a borderline resentment between the presidents...this year Ruth and I got to know each other, and there isn't any animosity," Rosario commented happily. "There is no drama here. There has been a lot of interaction, and I hope to continue that."

Along with mending communication gaps with BBC, Rosario has been busy securing extra money for SGA in a payback plan through the Athletics Department. According to Rosario, this is sensible because some SGA programs fund athletics events.

Rosario feels that athletics should contribute to those programs' financial needs. In return, SGA would receive a monetary return from the Athletics Department that they could then divide with BBC and allocate to other areas. 

Rosario is also busy with what he calls his "brain child"- a technology enhancement project that would allow for increased laptops in the library and reduce or eliminate printing costs on campus. 

The project would also provide additional wireless access points throughout the UP campus. Although the plan is still in its early stages, SGA has put together an ad hoc committee to research student interest in the project and the sort of assistance the University Technology Services Department would have to provide.	

Despite leading one of the largest organizations at UP, Rosario manages to find time for music. He is especially fond of the Dave Matthews Band.

You may also catch him playing cards or dominoes with friends during his free time.

"Socially, [Rosario] has a love of dominoes and that helps him to relax after hours," Owles said.

Reading is also a favorite pastime for Rosario, who admits to liking "cheesy" self-help books and having a secret passion for food, especially steak.  

"I normally don't tell people, but anyone who knows me well is aware that I love to go out to eat," Rosario said, slightly ashamed. 

In the future, Rosario hopes to graduate FIU in the spring of 2005 with a psychology degree and a minor in English. Then it's off to law school and, if Rosario has his way, eventually back to the classroom.

"I want to teach because I love helping people and seeing them succeed," he said. "In the end, I can guarantee that I will end up in a classroom before I die."

While Rosario is still new to the presidency and has just begun to tackle some of his goals, some say he shouldn't be compared to his successors.

"Jorge is just himself. He doesn't pretend to be something he is not. He is true to himself and to others around him. He is well liked and respected by the people on the council," Owles said. "I wouldn't want him to be like the others before him. He is his own person, and that is what makes him unique."

Sgt. Marc Veen, a 24-year-old Chicagoan, worked his way across the roof of a house on Route Henry and located an insurgent sniper who had set up his own rooftop vantage point a third of a mile away.

Adjusting for the distance and a light south wind, Veen held his breath, tightened his right index finger on the trigger of an M-14 rifle named Lucille, and hit the crouching Iraqi with a shot to the stomach. Two more rounds and the insurgent stopped moving.

Veen's group, Cougar Company, was on the southern end of the city, where the remaining resistance was toughest. The northernmost group, Apache Company, exhausted from three days of fierce fighting, crawled overnight into a home on the quieter end of the 2-7's territory.

Soldiers found colorful mattresses leaning on a wall and spread them on a stone floor. Bulletproof vests leaned against walls as young men with far-off stares looked at nothing, or slept hard.

One of the few awake was Sgt. Charles Thornton, 23, a team leader from Norristown, Pa. He had been fighting since Thursday night. A good friend in another platoon was killed storming a house on Saturday.

"It hurts," Thornton said. "I can't really think about it because I have to look out for my guys."

Grief he pushed off. Rage he kept.

As his team slept, he used a marker to write "This is 4 my buddy" on a 40 mm grenade for his M203 launcher.

"His wife lives right across the street from my wife," he said softly. "I'm all about fighting."



Bush nominates Condoleezza Rice to be secretary of state

Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's mentor in foreign-policy matters and his choice as a new secretary of state, is far closer to Bush in her worldview than the departing Colin Powell was.

Rice, whom Bush nominated Tuesday, would become the first black woman to be secretary of state if the Senate confirms her appointment.

Many observers saw her nomination as a move by the president to tighten his control over the national security apparatus, which during his first term saw titanic policy battles between the State Department and the CIA on one hand, and the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney's office on the other.

During an appearance Tuesday in the Roosevelt Room, Bush also announced that Rice's deputy, Stephen Hadley, would replace her as national security adviser. Hadley, a Yale Law School graduate and studious behind-the-scenes player, is close to the neoconservatives in Cheney's office and the Defense Department, who favor an activist foreign policy backed by military force.

Rice's four-year tenure at the National Security Council has received mixed reviews. Senior administration officials and well-connected outsiders have complained about a chaotic foreign policy-making process in which disputes are never settled. U.S. policy toward Iran was paralyzed by interagency battling over whether to engage or isolate Tehran, and Bush is completing his first term without a formal policy on Iran.

Rice and Hadley were warned repeatedly about threats from al-Qaida in the spring and summer of 2001, but took insufficient action, according to the report by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Bush's top aides didn't have a formal meeting on the al-Qaida threat until Sept. 10, 2001.

Hadley told the panel that before Sept. 11 he and Rice didn't think it was their responsibility to coordinate domestic agencies such as the FBI and the Transportation Department.

Headline: Safety reforms in danger, some NASA managers say
Author: Michael Cabbage / The Orlando Sentinel
&nbsp;
Nearly two years after the Columbia disaster, some NASA managers fear that cost-cutting measures and pressure to resume shuttle launches are jeopardizing critical safety reforms.

Confidential interviews with shuttle officials, as well as internal NASA documents, portray a program rushing to fly again despite serious money problems and growing concerns about meeting an ambitious schedule.

In August 2003, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board made 29 recommendations to improve shuttle safety, including 15 designated as preconditions for returning to flight.

None of those preconditions is considered more important than the one explicitly stating that NASA "adopt and maintain a shuttle flight schedule that is consistent with available resources."

 An increasing number of shuttle managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are worried that isn't happening.

To help balance its books, for example, NASA is considering hundreds of layoffs at Kennedy Space Center even as workers prepare for shuttle Discovery's planned liftoff in May.

Internal schedules show that 6 1?2 months of processing work on Discovery remains, but the orbiter must be rolled out of its hangar in 4 1?2 months to make the May launch window.

 The CAIB and a commission that investigated the 1986 Challenger disaster found earlier budget and schedule pressures clearly contributed to both catastrophes.

"Schedules are a necessary management tool, but they can get out of control," said the CAIB chairman, retired Adm. Hal Gehman, who added that he is unaware of any new shuttle-budget and schedule problems. "We found schedule pressure to be a cause of the Columbia accident, and it could happen again."

Senior NASA officials insist the priority remains safety, not budgets and schedules, and that the shuttle will not launch until all necessary work is completed.

 "There is no unlimited schedule and no unlimited budget," said Bill Parsons, NASA's shuttle-program manager. "We have to have some target we're out there working toward. If we don't meet a certain milestone because of a technical challenge or some other reason, we'll move the milestone out, and we'll move the target date out."

However, shuttle managers speak bluntly in internal documents and e-mails about not being able to meet some recommendations before Discovery's launch. Many communications make it clear they are not nearly as convinced as O'Keefe and Parsons that there is time and money to do the job right.

In several e-mails, strategies are discussed not for raising the bar but for interpreting the CAIB recommendations as narrowly as possible to fulfill them more cheaply and quickly.

After debris fatally pierced Columbia's protective heat shielding during launch, the CAIB recommended that NASA develop a way to inspect and make emergency repairs "to the widest possible range of damage" before the shuttle's return to flight.

 Efforts to engineer a boom that will be used for inspections in orbit have run into technical problems. The work on developing repair techniques also has been slow and expensive, with projected costs topping $100 million, and millions more expected in additional overruns. 

One unlikely money-saving option put forward by the Orbiter Project Office at Johnson is to "terminate efforts and accept risk," leaving the shuttle with no repair kit and that crucial CAIB recommendation unmet.

 Senior NASA managers told reporters during an Oct. 29 teleconference that challenges remain, but significant progress has been made on emergency-repair techniques.

The agency plans to do testing during Discovery's upcoming flight.

Headline: Honors students attend national conference
Author: Katherine Beale / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Walking together through the chilly Louisiana weather, six female FIU students strode down the famed Bourbon Street of New Orleans on Nov. 13.

The students, members of the university's Honors College, ventured to the "Big Easy" this Veteran's Day Weekend to attend the 39th Annual National Collegiate Honors Council conference, an event in which students from all over the country participate in academic presentations and competitions.

Part of FIU's participation at the conference included a presentation by three students about their Honors College study abroad experiences. 

The session was moderated by Dr. Manuel J. Carvajal, director of the Honors College study abroad program to Spain and professor of economics. Juniors Annette Shumway and Shradha Ramchadani, along with senior Patricia Castillo, each discussed their study abroad experiences.

All three students fulfilled their fourth-year Honors College course requirements through their participation in the Honors study abroad program this past summer.

Juniors Ola Akache and Adriana Campos presented their research on Nov. 12 with a poster titled, "Making Waves: Women's Struggle for Recognition." The poster highlighted some of the accomplishments women have made in science and law.

Their glossy, burgundy poster attracted more than its fair share of attention in a room full of student presenters from honors programs around the country.

Akache and Campos answered questions from curious conference attendees, explaining the meaning of their research and the reasons why their topic held special significance for them.

"I'm premed and she's prelaw," Campos said, gesturing towards Akache. "We are women in science and law, so this was interesting to us."

Over the course of four days, the students and faculty attended a wide variety of conference sessions on everything from how to build a better Honors program to images of Islam in today's media.

Other FIU Honors College conference attendees included Ivelaw Griffith, dean of the Honors College and professor of political science, who gave a presentation on how to attract and reward superior honors professors, and Lesley Northup, associate dean and honors professor. Various other administrative and faculty members within the college also attended.

While the FIU students had their plane tickets, hotel rooms and conference fees paid for by the Honors College, many conference attendees from other colleges had to pay some or all of these expenses themselves.

"The students from [the University of] Puerto Rico had to pay over $2,000 each," Shumway said.

Several FIU students commented that had the college not sponsored their trip, they would not have been able to attend the conference.

"[This conference was] an investment in the students," Griffith stated. He mentioned that the important thing was not the budget, but the experiences the students received.

With the trip funded by the college, the students admitted to having more time to gain good experiences and memories.

 "I definitely appreciated the opportunity to go to the conference," Shumway said. "We learned so much, not only from the conference itself, but also from all of the people around us. It was such a wealth of knowledge."

Besides attending the various sessions, though, the students took advantage of the trip to have a good time.

They explored New Orleans, sampled the city's famous cuisine and just relaxed.

"It was a very worthwhile experience," Akache said. "It was a mixture of fun and academics, but more fun than anything else."

Aside from Castillo, who graduates this semester, all the students plan to submit proposals for next year's conference, to be held in St. Louis, Mo.

Headline: Bookstore's buyback policy irks students
Author: Allan Pichardo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Students might be familiar with the advertisment posted around FIU with a young woman holding a sign that reads:  "We want 50 percent back," in large boldface characters. This sign refers to the FIU Bookstore's approaching textbook buy-back season.

During finals week every semester, students gather their used books and stand in line at either the University Park or Biscayne Bay Campus bookstores, hoping to return them for some extra cash. Nevertheless, the consensus among students is that the bookstore is not keeping up their end of the bargain. 

"Don't tell me you are giving me 50 percent and then give me 10. I'm upset about that," said Natalie Diaz, a junior. Diaz is just one of the many students distraught over the store's advertisements, because, according to her, the bookstore does not pay students enough money for the books they buy back. 

"I plan on selling [the books] on Half.com," said David Nunez, a junior who majors in sports management, expressing his reluctance to give the FIU Bookstore another try. He is turning to online booksellers to get the extra pocket money he needs.

"Students feel robbed because we're not getting 20 percent of the full price half the time," Nunez said. 

Not all students, though, share the same enthusiasm when it comes to selling their school books online.

"I think it's too much of a hassle, but I know people that [sell their books online] and get more money back that way," Diaz said. 

Chris Quaintance, operations manager of the FIU Bookstore, expressed concerns that students might not be completely informed about the process that must occur before the bookstore can pay students half price for their used books.

"Some times [of the year] are better than others for selling back books," Quaintance explained, "but, the limiting factor is the timing of the book order." 

According to Quaintance, finals week is the peak time for selling back used books. However, in order for the bookstore to pay students half of what they originally paid for their books, it needs to receive instructors' book orders for the coming semester. These book orders are called adoptions.

When all the adoptions have been submitted, the bookstore is able to determine which used books they will need to meet next semester's demand. 

Quaintance, who is majoring in accounting, viewed the problem from a student's point of view.

"It costs students money if [instructors] don't turn in the orders," he said. He stated that the bookstore actually prefers to buy used books because they are 25 percent cheaper than new books and distributors might not always have the necessary texts available right away.

Quaintance recommended that students who are not sure if they should sell their books to the bookstore double-check with their professors to see if they have placed their adoptions for the next semester. If they have not submitted them, then it is unlikely that those students will receive half price for their books. Knowing this information before trying to sell them back, he said, may help to avoid disappointment.

Headline: Reality Check: Hype slows but some hits stay course
Author: Pamela Sitt / The Seattle Times
&nbsp;
It's been a tough fall for reality TV. And by that I mean both the season and the corresponding ratings tumble. 

While networks continue to roll out new reality shows at a mind-boggling tear, viewers finally seem to be saying, enough already! 

Recent premieres like FOX's "My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss" and NBC's "The $25 Million Hoax" tanked. Follow-ups to last season's breakout hits _ "The Apprentice," "The Swan" _ are stumbling. Former franchise hits like "The Bachelor" are so over it's not even funny, kinda like Tara Reid (although someone forgot to tell ABC, which is planning a seventh edition). 

There are bright spots. ABC has bona fide hits in "Wife Swap" and "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," and has just announced plans for an "Extreme Makeover: Wedding Edition." (Genius!) The kazillionth edition of CBS's "Survivor" is still going strong. Ratings machine "American Idol" returns to FOX in January. Tonight's 2-hour premiere of "The Amazing Race 6" (9 p.m., CBS) features, among others, a pair of married pro wrestlers, an ex-Playboy Playmate and a Mormon who is a former "striptease aerobics" instructor. 

And just because some of these tragic newbies actually make me nostalgic for Paris and Nicole, that dynamic duo will be back on FOX tomorrow night in a half-hour special, "The Simple Life 2: The Stuff We Weren't Allowed To Show You" (8:30 p.m., FOX). Yes, that's really what it's called. 

`THE BACHELOR 6' 

The series reached a new low when Byron used the word "irregardless." And speaking of meaningless words, can we ban the phrase "Everything happens for a reason" from reality dating shows, please? No one who says it ever means it _ like when someone breaks up with you but says "We can still be friends." (9 p.m. Wednesdays, ABC) 

SURVIVOR: VANUATU

I have to say I will miss Sarge and his one-liners, delivered in that mumbling Southern drawl. When a cute, spotted little piggy is delivered to the recently merged Alinta tribe and the survivors are instructed to feed the pig rather than eat it, Sarge responds: "It was about as big a letdown as when I found out Estrogen City was moving into Lopevi." Why is Eliza still here? (8 p.m. Thursdays, CBS) 

THE APPRENTICE 2 

The most fun part of this task _ organizing a bridal trunk show _ was watching the men try to help women find wedding dresses. One customer says she's looking for a sleeveless gown. Bumbling Wes' agreeable response: "Who likes sleeves?" Incompetent Maria continues to be so by forgetting to include a phone number on a mass e-mail to New York brides, which also happens to be Mosaic's main marketing effort. 

But Mosaic, whose not-so-secret weapon is bridal-shop owner Sandy, still wins by a landslide and Bleeping Chris of bleeping Long Island, as Apex's project manager, is fired. (9 p.m. Thursdays, NBC)

AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL 3 

Diva Eva has a mini-meltdown when faced with a photo shoot involving tarantulas. Ann continues to take bad pictures. Toccara can't pronounce "Jean Paul Gaultier" and gets bounced. This week: Actor (and former model) Taye Diggs shows up and will likely out-pretty the girls. (8 p.m. Wednesdays, UPN) 

THE SWAN 2

You know, after watching the stories on "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," it's hard to get excited about people getting makeovers just because they got fat. (9 p.m. Mondays, FOX) 

MY BIG FAT OBNOXIOUS BOSS

The clueless contestants have to sell hot soup on the street on a sweltering July day in Chicago. They're actually not bad at it, either. We also are introduced to the fake boss's fake trophy wife and fake daughter, who is described as a "not-so-bright cousin of Paris Hilton." Yowza. (9 p.m. Sundays, FOX) 

THE SURREAL LIFE

VH1 has announced the cast of its upcoming fourth installment of "The Surreal Life," which cemented its place in pop-culture history with this season's unlikely romance between Flavor Flav and Brigitte Nielsen. 

The new motley crew includes Verne Troyer (aka Mini-Me), Adrianne Curry ("America's Next Top Model"), Marcus Schenkenberg (male supermodel, Pamela Anderson's ex), Christopher Knight ("The Brady Bunch"), Jane Wiedlin (former Go-Go, not Belinda Carlisle), Chyna Doll (former WWE wrestler) and Da Brat (rapper, starred in "Glitter" with Mariah Carey). The show is in production now and premieres Jan. 9.

Headline: These are the best scams colleges can devise?
Author: Rick Morrissey / Chicago Tribune
&nbsp;
The best bogus job ever devised was the one the University of Iowa allegedly came up with for basketball star Connie Hawkins in the summer of 1960. 

They handed him the heavy responsibility of ridding the football stadium of seaweed.

As much as Hawkins might have wanted to keep a constant vigil, there wasn't much work to do, seeing as how the nearest ocean was about 1,000 miles away.

Say what you want about the dishonesty of the job but please don't skimp when handing out points for creativity. 

It was all for naught, though, because Hawkins eventually was kicked out of Iowa after being linked to a gambling and point-shaving scandal. And he didn't even have any kelp to show for it.

Former Ohio State running back and current I'll-say-anything guy Maurice Clarett recently made some sensational accusations against his old school: that boosters gave him thousands of dollars; that academic advisers steered him toward classes he could pass without attending; that coach Jim Tressel arranged loaner cars for him; and that Tressel's brother set up lucrative jobs that didn't involve work.

Other than that, everything was on the up and up.

If these charges are true, it means that, while technology keeps marching along and advances are made in almost every other field, cheating in college sports hasn't evolved much in the past 50 years.

I don't want to be perceived as a guy who condones deceit, but ... can't they do better than this? Isn't there a more interesting job market for pampered football players? 

According to Clarett, Dick Tressel, a Buckeyes assistant, got the running back well-paying landscaping jobs. These were the best kind of well-paying landscaping jobs, the kind that apparently don't require a landscaper to show up.

Let's assume for a moment that Clarett is telling the truth, with the full understanding that the guy has the approximate credibility of a convicted felon/police informant. I would feel much better if the landscaping job involved growing AstroTurf. Something creative, folks. 

If you're going to cheat, have a sense of humor about it.

I would feel much better if a school went on probation for, say, giving athletes telemarketing jobs that didn't involve talking on the telephone. If you're going to cheat, help make the world a nicer place.

Another problem area is the automobile. Whenever you see a college athlete riding around in a new SUV, it automatically should raise eyebrows, if not red flags.

It's such an old way of cheating that, if Red Grange had shown up at Illinois with a new horse and buggy, people would have started looking for his street agent.

"I love transfers because their cars are already paid for," Jerry Tarkanian once said.

Giving 18-year-old kids money or cars and expecting them to be low-key about it is unrealistic. You would have a better chance of getting rich in Las Vegas than of getting a college athlete to be shy about his ill-gotten gains. (On the other hand, your odds of getting rich at UNLV . . . )

So, yeah, the car thing is a cliche. But schools continue to use it as a carrot. If I were a coach, this is what I would say to a player: "I know that in your very limited life experience, a car means everything to you. 

You can't think of anything more desirable than a nice ride, unless it's a nice ride that comes with the standard-feature hot-looking tutor. But I'm here to tell you that the first place NCAA investigators and snoopy reporters go when looking for infractions is the team parking lot. Two words: Free moped.''

We also are seeing the same academic fraud we were seeing 40 years ago. A few years back, Minnesota went on probation when a tutor admitted to writing papers for basketball players. 

If you're going to cheat, think big. Get somebody to write a doctoral dissertation for your freshman power forward on "Designing Recombinant Hemoglobins.''

All of this - the cars, the phony jobs, the academic shenanigans - cries out for football and basketball going to a minor-league system in which the athletes are paid and the inducements are legal. But what fun would that be? In Dan Jenkins' novel "Way Out of Bounds; Life Its Own Self," a Texas Christian booster suggests buying a recruit his own 7-Eleven "so he can rob it anytime he wants to.''

Ridiculous, but it's a start.

Headline: A bite with Carlos
Subheadline: La Nonna offers quality service
Author: Carlos C. Olaechea / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Sometimes, when I'm really hungry, I don't want to eat anything exotic or hard to pronounce. Dishes like lobster salad with green tomato gel and avocado sorbet seem unappetizing when there's a rumble in my tummy. During such times, there's only one cuisine that will satisfy me: Italian. Unfortunately, Italian cuisine in Miami has gone on the South Beach diet.  Instead of ordering hearty portions of beefy, cheesy lasagna, I'm confronted with menus that read like a dietician prepared them:  arrugula salad with a light vinagrette, pappardelle lightly dressed with a light tomato and garlic broth, lightly seared veal chop with capers and a light balsamic glaze. All of this new and "improved" Italian cuisine comes, of course, with practically no seasoning and the standard hefty price tag.  Where are my dependable Italian-American restaurants?

Fortunately, we have a nice mom-and-pop style Italian restaurant right by FIU. This great restaurant is known as La Nonna,  which means "the grandmother" in Italian. The funny thing is that the restaurant actually has an Italian grandmother, and she is responsible for inspiring the no-frills Italian fare served in there. 

The first time I ate there , I went with two friends who suggested we try it.  The ambiance is very cozy and is reminiscent of one of those old-school Italian restaurants in New York that you always see in movies. The walls are partially covered with wood paneling and overhead are dark wooden beams, making the restaurant look as if you're in someone's house back in the old country. The service is courteous and prompt. 

The most remarkable thing about this restaurant, however, is the menu. Dishes average about $8 and most are under $10. All come with salad, and meat dishes come with a side of pasta.  The selection was quite impressive. All of the standard items were there, as well as a few lesser known but classic dishes, like chicken florentine, a sumptuous combination of chicken topped with spinach, prosciutto and mozzarella cheese.

My dining partners ordered baked ziti and eggplant parmesana with a side of fettuccine alfredo. I ordered chicken parmesana with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The garlic bread that comes standard with every dish was your basic buttered and toasted French bread with garlic, dry parsley and grated parmesan cheese. The complementary salads were pretty basic and consisted of small plates of romaine lettuce, carrot strips and tomatoes with a creamy Italian dressing. When the main courses arrived, however, we were all impressed. The portions were big and the food looked very appetizing. The baked ziti was good and dependable - anything but light, with no surprises, just what you want from a plate of baked ziti. The eggplant parmesana was equally good and well portioned. 

My chicken parmesana  was satisfyingly crispy, with a good, tangy tomato sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese. The fettuccine alfredo that came as a side with the eggplant and chicken parmesana was perhaps one of the best that I have ever tried. Its butter cream sauce was of a perfect consistency and creaminess. 

Dessert selections were equally good. They included a house made ricotta cheesecake, Italian ices and tartuffos, which are balls of ice cream dipped in chocolate or nuts. We ordered the amaretto tartuffo and shared it. The ice cream had a very pleasant almond flavor and was coated in toasted pecans.
