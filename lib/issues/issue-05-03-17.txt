&nbsp;
Paris looks like a huge open-air museum to me. It seems that on every corner you turn, there's an ancient castle or monument staring you in the face. It's an imposing and breath-taking city, indeed, but one that's also uncannily easy to "conquer."

Transportation

Getting around Paris is no mystery. The transportation system is well-integrated. Train stations like Montparnasse lead down to metros (subway stations), which are practically on every corner. There's also the RER, a breed between a subway and a train, which gives you a high and low view of the city so you don't need to pay for those red sightseeing cars. One of the RER drop-offs is at the nearby city of Versailles, where the beautiful Louis XIV palace is located. 

For 30 euros, you get the best deal in town - a single pass that lets you use any kind of transportation in and around Paris for a whole week. 

Almost every morning, I took the train alone from the town of La Falaise (with a floating population of 621 and no commerce), to Paris's Montparnasse station, an hour away. I was staying with acquaintances I had only met over the phone - a Brazilian lady and her French husband. 

Delicacies

We carried whole conversations in Portuguese, and I inserted half a sentence in French. They fixed me exotic dishes every night when I came home for dinner, such as escargot, couscous, foie gras (goose liver) and duck legs. 

Sometimes I ate chocolate crepes in Paris throughout the day and chocolate crepes again for dessert at the house back in the village. Good stuff. 

But the husband was somewhat of a hermit and didn't like the big city, and the lady often wanted to keep him company. So she only accompanied me to Paris a couple of times to get me used to it. After that, I was on my own. 

There are tourists and lines everywhere in Paris, even when it's as cold. I visited the Eiffel Tower and waited a couple of hours to get to the tower in a shaky, little elevator. I felt uneasy, but the panorama was worth any shivers from fear or cold, and any crowds.

Montmatre

Another highlight of Paris was the neighborhood of Montmatre. After climbing a hill with the ancient Catholic chapel of Sacre-Cour on top, there was an overlook  of a "village of sin." 

After climbing down the other side of the hill, there were artists everywhere painting portraits of tourists in the middle of the street, which is no sin except a sin of the pocket. But when you get to the bottom, you are taken aback by the number of sex shops and cabarets. 

The mildest one seemed to be the Moulin Rouge, now more like a circus. 

In fact, in Paris, the duality of Catholicism and sex is quite an interesting recurring theme. I re encountered this sensuousness in a more artistic way at the Museum d'Orsee. 

Walking in, there was a  sculpture of a woman writhing after having been attacked by a "snake." On the right side of the hall, there was a huge painting of a Roman orgy, titled  something like "The Decadents of Rome." 

Near the world-famous impressionist works by Monet and Van Gogh, there was a painting by Courbet that showed a vagina titled,  "The Origin of the World." 

The Louvre Museum has more classical art, although its Greco-Roman aisle presents sculptures of men in questionable actions.    

But I redeemed myself. I went to Sacre-Cour, Notre Dame and about 10 other churches or basilicas in Paris. I unintentionally  witnessed Mass in French in a little chapel among the expensive shops of the Galeries Lafayette and understood none of it.

Prices

Paris is not cheap, and prices are disproportionate. The price of tickets for attractions like the Eiffel Tower is on average 10 euros. Meanwhile, the price of a cup of coffee is a little under half of that, at four euros. 

The coffee was only worth it for me because I sat in a Paris café and imagined that Ernest Hemingway must have done the same thing when he lived there. So I felt like a Bohemian novelist for half an hour. But in Hemingway's time, there was no such thing as the euro, which is worth about 33 percent more than the dollar.

Entertainment

At some point during the two weeks I spent in France, I was invited to sing at an Irish Pub named Corcoran's, in the trendy Paris neighborhood of St. Germain-des-Pres. My payment was free food at the pub and free board for one night at one of the cheapest Paris hotels; the nightly rate was 80 euros. 

Lost and Found

After spending the whole day worshipping the Eiffel Tower, I got to the Montparnasse station and, not looking at any signs and assuming I knew where to go, I took the wrong train. 

I ended up in a town in the middle of nowhere, in the complete dark, and thought I'd spend the midnight hour alone in a desolate train station. 

To me, French rudeness is a false myth. It was French Samaritans who saved me and directed me to another train that took me to another station where I took yet another train back to La Falaise that night. 

The trip back lasted three hours instead of one. 

I arrived at 7:15 p.m. and the lady with whom I was staying drove me to a new train station and deposited me inside my fifth train of the day, so I could meet up with a couple of French girls I barely knew and proceed to the soiree (party) somewhere near Paris. 

Party Time

It was a house party spiced up with lots of toast with caviar, sangria and champagne, American hip-hop, me trying to speak French to people and people trying to speak English to me. Well, at least I made some new acquaintances. I took about 200 pictures and, in spite of the transportation system, walked about 200 miles. But I wanted to walk. 

I had an exhilarating sense of freedom strolling by myself along the Seine River and the Place de la Concorde, through the Arc de Triomphe and across bridges held up by sculptures of golden angels. I also felt safe. 

You do run a serious risk, however, of wanting to stay there indefinitely.

Headline: The Shallow Seas
Subheadline: Spring Break Destinations: The Bahamas
Author: Mailyn Mederos / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A wonderful destination for Spring Break is the Bahamas. 

The Bahamas or Baja Mar in Spanish, meaning "shallow seas," was discovered in 1492 by Europeans. It is comprised of over 700 islands and 2,000 cays.  

The islands' tropical weather and reefs attract many tourists for outdoor activities such as fishing, snorkeling, sea-kayaking, sailing, swimming, windsurfing, diving, biking, hiking, horseback riding and bird watching.

Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, is located across the dock of the major cruise lines in the Rawson Square area on Bay St. Tourists, government workers, hawkers and musicians populate the area.  

Toward the west and north of the square, Bahamian women can be found braiding hair for about $1 a strand. 

The center of the Bahamian government and buildings from the 1800s, including the Opposition Building and House of Assembly and Senate can be found in the south region. 

The Straw Market is within walking distance toward the west. 

There are about 150 vendors selling all types of things from beads, designer purses and t-shirts to shark-tooth necklaces and hand-carved wooden artifacts. 

 West of the Straw Market is the Pompey Museum, which houses a collection  detailing the history of Bahamian slavery.

The shops are ordinarily open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Banks are open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  

For travelers, there is not much of a need for Bahamian dollars. Credit cards are accepted throughout the island, and there are numerous ATMs as well. 

The Exuma Land and Sea Park is over 22 miles long and eight miles wide. On the east side there are the deep waters of Exuma Sound, and on the west side there are the shallow reefs and sandbars of Great Bahama Bank. 

The park was established in 1958 and has no commercial developments, resorts or restaurants.  

Its main office is in the middle and has displays of the Exumas, assorted maps, information sheets and reference books.  

Seven miles of marked hiking trails criss-cross the Exuma land through groves of palm and silver buttonwood, limestone sink holes, a tidal creek-bed with lookout points and loyalist plantation ruins. Various beaches can be found on secluded coves on the leeward side.

Motel-style lodges in the downtown areas of major cities have a double-room charge averaging $95 to $125 per night, while luxury resorts charge up to 25 percent more.  

There are "out island" lodges, which are less expensive, but the cost of food and transportation is greater because everything is imported.  

Most resorts and hotels offer all-inclusive packages or three-day and seven-day packages.

The Atlantis resort has 2,119 rooms, 230 suites, 21 eateries, 17 bars, seven swimming pools with slides and rides, four beaches, a casino and an outdoor aquarium with snorkeling. Prices start at $250.  

The Comfort Suites is a three-story hotel with 320 junior suites, a pool and a spa. Rates are from $160 to $200 per person per night.  

The Howelton Rose House is an old Georgian home with four rooms. Breakfast is served on the front porch. Rates range from $100 to $130 per night. 

According to Travelocity, a roundtrip flight from Miami to Nassau from March 21 through March 25 costs $199 plus hotel and food expenses.  

A three-night cruise on the Royal Carribbean departing March 18 costs $484. Carnival Cruise Lines charges $349.

Jackie Buigas, a student majoring in biology, said, "One of the stops for a cruise that I took was  to the Bahamas. The best thing I did was visit the Atlantis Paradise Island Hotel with its beautiful aquarium, pools and casino."

Headline: "Constantine" proves Reeves needs a career change
Author: Leoncio Alvarez / Life! Editor
&nbsp;
Hollywood needs to stop casting pretty-faced actors in roles that require talent. 

Keanu Reeves, who did a horrible job in "The Matrix" trilogy, outdoes himself in "Constantine." 

As John Constantine, a cigarette-addicted exorcist who is trying to buy himself into heaven because he attempted suicide as a teen, Reeves  tries to take a demon out of a little girl's body. 

The girl is strapped to a bed while family members and a priest repeatedly recite lines from the Bible. Sound a bit familiar? 

I thought I was having yet another "Exorcist" flashback.

While the story may not be the most original, the special effects were a positive factor in this film. 

When Reeves visits the director's idea of hell, fiery images of demons surround the screen, making it look all too real. 

Francis Lawrences's fine first attempt at film directing must be mentioned. 

After a career of directing Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson music videos, Lawrence has traveled into the film industry with an attitude that strives for realism instead of anything over the top.

However, right when the viewer thinks he or she is in the middle of a decent scene, Reeves destroys the possibility with his so-called acting. 

The plot is very imaginative and creative, but the acting is just horrendous. 

Perhaps the film would be better if the role of Constantine had been given to an actor and not a degraded surf reject who is getting too old to handle his own career. 

Reeves has been type-casted as the emotionless black leather-wearing man who has absolutely no grasp on reality or the imaginary anymore. 

When will we see Reeves in a role holding Kirsten Dunst's hand and walking down the beach? When he realizes he has a terminal disease and is going to die?

The best acting honors, in my opinion, would go to Tilda Swinton as the angel Gabrielle, and Lucifer's main henchman Balthazar, played by Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale. 

Even though they are not major characters in the film and don't own names known to many, their careers are promising and they provide exactly what the film is missing - talent.

The overall concept of "Constantine" is an imaginative one, even though the creativity is taken from the Alan Moore's DC comic book, "Hellblazer." 

A fair attempt at recreating the comic strip was made. 

Now, if only the cast would have been better chosen, then maybe the film would have met at least the average viewer's expectations.

Response to Melissa Rodriguez's "Boogie fights"

On March 14, 2005 The Beacon ran an opinion article titled, "Women are the life of the party, should get perks." 

I am deeply disappointed that a university-run newspaper would print such immature, obviously sexist and stereotypical writing. Rodriguez's arguments for giving women preferential treatment at clubs are shallow and downright absurd. 

Her subtle implication that "club perks" are some form of retribution to women who have been "treated as second class citizens, demoralized and practically made outcasts of society" is severely short-sighted. 

The women who fought hard for equality in the 1960s and 70s hardly benefit at all from these so-called "perks." Rodriguez also fails to acknowledge the more disturbing implications of these "perks." 

Such policies (1) effectively exploit women (2) perpetuate sexism, gender inequality and gender stereotypes and (3) frequently put women in awkward situations. 

The sexist nature of Rodriguez's article is obvious - from her choice of words (e.g. "whoring it up") to her claim that "men are nothing but trouble when they drink" while women are perfectly well behaved when drunk. 

Overall, her argument is very weak. The current policies nightclubs have for women are not only unfair, but also a dangerous, different, subtler form of using women as tools of capitalism.

Response to Melissa Quincosa's "Students to discuss Iraq at Café Hillel"

I am writing in response to the article that was written in Monday's paper about the Café Hillel campaign that took place on Tuesday, March 15 at the University Park campus and on Wednesday, March 16 at the Biscayne Bay Campus. 

The Café Hillel campaign was designed by the Jewish Student Union in conjunction with Hillel Second Generation to promote and encourage conversation and communication among Jewish and non-Jewish students by creating an environment in which Israel was the resource and "a cup of coffee" was the excuse.  

Café Hillel is a famous coffee shop in Israel, in which people of all nationalities and religions gather to speak their mind over a cup of coffee everyday.  

Therefore, the Café Hillel campaign was a program designed to invite you to have a free cup of coffee Café Hillel style and to converse with us. We wanted to inform you about all of the technological and medical advancements that are happening in Israel today, as well as to show you a beautiful exhibition of Israel's landmarks.    

The program did not intend to create controversy on campus or to speak about political matters.  It was not created as an open forum to speak about the war in Iraq.  

However, you have the right to voice your opinion and it was welcomed there, but that was not the nature of the event as the article titled "Students to discuss Iraq at Café Hillel" suggested.  

We want to let you know that the technology for AOL Instant Messenger was developed in 1996 by four young Israelis and that Israeli scientists developed the first fully computerized, no-radiation, diagnostic instrument for breast cancer. 

Also, you should know that voicemail technology was developed in Israel.  You can find more of these fun facts on www.israel21c.org.  

Israel is a flourishing country with a true melting pot of people of all religions and nationalities.  

It is a developing country in which, although small in size, is immense in its contributions to the world at large.  Stay informed and keep talking. You never know what you may find out.

Headline: Stage parents obsess over child star's road to Hollywood success
Author: Dara Bramson / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
In Miami, one of the main hubs of the entertainment industry, children are often subjected to the intensity of the business. Children are unable to put themselves into the business anymore than a chicken can ask to be baked or fried. 

Behind the smiling face of a child in an Old Navy ad or an abandoned adolescent who lost a parent in a TRUTH commercial there is something you do not see- the parent, the driving force behind it all. 

Unfortunately, it seems many parents have difficulty distinguishing the difference between what their child wants and their own personal dream.

Most children develop a recreational hobby. Sometimes they are even good at it. Some parents will take this and run with it. 

A knack develops into a gift, and that gift is then turned into a full-blown career. Eventually, there are no inhibitions; these talents must be shared with the world.

Discrediting children who genuinely love performing is not my objective. There are oodles of talented kids who are not being brainwashed by neurotic parents. 

However, there is no need for a child to reach puberty at age eight, and the makeup and gym can wait until at least middle school. The last thing we need is Christina Aguilera's "Dirty" music video to be an inspiration for five-year-old girls.

A guest on Dr. Phil's show even put braces on her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter because she had a crooked tooth. Understandably, going through preschool with an imperfection to that extent could be very detrimental to a child's future.

The term "stage parent" is a label often given to parents who obsessively reinforce their child's talent. Bonnie, a guest on Dr. Phil, subliminally displayed the selfish motives of these types of parents. 

It became evident throughout the interview that Regan, her four-year-old daughter, had minimal input regarding her own passion, or lack thereof, for beauty pageants. 

"If we don't come and sit in this chair, someone else will be here talking about pageants," Bonnie said.

Far too often, you may hear these parents using the word "we." "We shot a commercial last month." We? Were you in it too? The child is the one who auditioned, attended rehearsals and learned the lines.

While being a stage parent may be a full-time job for which parents are not being compensated, nobody is forcing them to make this commitment. 

These are parents, who, in all likelihood, failed miserably in accomplishing their dream of becoming an "American Idol." Now they take solace in living vicariously through their children. 

The cover of the most recent issue of Pop Star magazine is crammed with pictures of the younger siblings of every pop star: Jamie-Lynn Spears, Aaron Carter and at least three 12-year-olds who could be Eminem's offspring. 

It is likely that most stage parents would forfeit their American Express black card if their child could appear among the youthful pin-ups. 

Regardless of whose dream is being pursued, these parents need to take their child's safety into consideration. Regan's mother, Bonnie, the guest on Dr. Phil, seemed to be in denial that there was a safety issue. 

"If the threats continue, I would quit in a heartbeat. But we haven't actually received threats," said Bonnie, defending herself. "You had a dead cat on your porch with a crown on its head," said Dr. Phil. 

For those of you who disagree with me about overbearing stage parents ... I rest my case.

Subheadline: Parking situation worsens with the fair's arrival in Miami
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
Everyday, students and faculty bare the never-ending battle of parking at FIU. Whether it is fighting your peers for the perfect spot or following a defenseless book- carrying student across a whole parking lot to her car and then giving her a ride because she forgot she is actually in the garage by the gym, the parking situation is incredibly tedious.

If students thought parking was a hassle before, the Miami-Dade County Youth Fair and Exposition is coming to town, which means that available parking spots will be at an all-time low. Noticeably, the Youth Fair property borders along FIU, but that's not a problem until the fair is in session. 

Then, Lot Six by the Wertheim Performing Arts Center becomes completely out of bounds for the FIU community, leaving the music, dance and theatre students without close-to-home parking spaces. Also, the Office of Parking and Transportation has recently closed off Lot Five to make room for carnival attendants. 

Now, only residential students may park there; any others will be fined or will find a boot on their car. Where are students supposed to park? Garages? No, in every garage the first two stories are only for faculty and staff, leaving us even less space for parking.

On most days, being late to class is inevitable because of the terrible parking situation. You could spend up to half an hour searching for a parking space. When you do find a space, it is most likely so far away from the building that you might as well have walked there from your house. 

With the fair taking up so much parking, it will be even more difficult for FIU students to find a decent parking space, especially with a recent agreement between FIU and the fair that will allow fair-goers to park in FIU's parking garages after 9 p.m. 

In order to avoid having a nervous breakdown during the time the fair is in town, try to arrive at FIU 30 minutes or more before your first class, wear comfortable shoes for the long trek to class, stay on campus for the majority of the day to avoid having to find parking again. Most of all, keep yourself from thinking about how unfair it is that carnies have better parking spots than you.

Headline: The Band
Subheadline: FIU pitchers create dugout band and credit themselves for creating energy and offense
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Baseball has been famously known as a game in which pitchers rely on the position players for run production, defensive support and, sometimes, even moral encouragement. 

But for three games this season, the FIU pitchers decided to give something back to the teammates who gave them support in more ways than one.

La Bateria (Spanish for "The Battery"), FIU's dugout-based band, energized the team's offensive firepower and terrorized opposing teams.

The band, composed solely of pitchers, claims to have been a vital part of the in victories on March 7 and 8 against Wagner and LaSalle, respectively, and the main force behind coach Danny Price's historic 1000th win on March 10 against Quinnipiac.

Senior left-handed pitcher David Asher is the manager of the band and credits himself for its creation.

"Coach [Price] said we needed more energy in the dugout," said Asher. "So I told these guys to put something together."

And put something together they did, as six pitchers combined to form what they call the "greatest dugout-band in the history of the Eastern United States." Every time a Golden Panther got on base, the hip-shaking rhythms of the band soon followed to hype up their batter and intimidate opposing pitchers.

Senior right-hander and band leader Ammer Cabrera got the beat going by playing his conga drum, which gives the biggest impact of all the instruments.

Junior reliever Frank Gonzalez kept the tempo by playing the cowbell.

"When Nick Cadena hit a homerun, he pointed to us and said it was because of us," said Gonzalez. "We said, 'Yeah, we know.' He doesn't need to tell us that."

Freshman right-hander Elih Villanueva is the lead clapper. His job is to get other players in the dugout (mainly non-pitchers) to start clapping along with the beat.

"Every time we start it up, the teams come alive and we get runs on the board," said Villanueva. "Pitchers are not only contributing on the mound, but off the mound as well."

Freshman right-hander Les Rodriguez plays lead maraca with a 20 oz. Gatorade bottle filled with rocks which he shakes. Senior closer Danny Hernandez plays backup maracas - mini-maracas not much bigger than a pair of blow pops.

"I go home. I fall asleep and I still have the rhythm in my head," said Hernandez. "There's no way the other team can play under that pressure."

Junior lefty Denny Hernandez plays the bass by hitting a bat against the dugout garbage can, creating a loud thumping sound.

Junior right-hander Matt Rainey plays the guiro by scraping his cleats on the drain of the dugout. He is the only non-Hispanic band member. Rainey, whom other band members refer to as the "token white guy", says he brings a little Texas flavor to the band despite being rhythmically challenged.

"We're unstoppable," said Rainey. "The teams from up north [have] never heard music like that before, and they just can't take it."

How do the other players feel about the band? 

"It brings flavor, helps the hitter [and] it helps motivate us. It's fun to be around while we're hitting in the dugout and it helps keep the team focused. Everybody likes it, good rhythm,"  said senior center fielder Dennis Diaz.

"The band is great, man. The band comes up with great beats and is definitely a rally-starter. It works every time," said junior right fielder Yahmed Yema.

"It brings a lot of energy and positive feeling in the dugout and gets the team rolling in the right direction. It seems that the band knows when to kick in that extra spark when the team needs it," said senior left-handed pitcher Jon Banke.

Some players say that are sometimes so focused on the game that they forget the band is there and can't explain why they did so well.

"I like the band," said freshman left fielder James McOwen. "I don't really listen to them that much, but the fact that they're doing it, I respect that."

Unfortunately, after just three games of action, the band was put to rest for undisclosed reasons. The announcement came as a shock to the team and some band members are not taking it lightly.

"I think that it's a blow to our team's ego," said Cabrera.

And it could be a blow to the team's offensive production as well. The Golden Panthers averaged 11.3 runs in the games in which the band played. Without it, they average 6.5 runs.

"It was a great idea," said freshman catcher Danny Marquez. "It pumped up the team and it always seemed to work."

The band remains optimistic for the future, despite the loss of their dugout venue, and is not ruling out any plans.

"We need a good marketing department," Cabrera said laughingly. "We're definitely thinking of taking [the band] on the road."

Headline: Baseball wins two of three over Rutgers
Author: Xavier Villamarzo / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Golden Panthers showed no signs of slowing down after coach Danny Price's 1000th win, by winning two games of a three-game series against the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers University, (6-5), March 11-13 at the Baseball Stadium at University Park. 

FIU raised their season record to 16-6 in a series that featured a combined total of 49 runs, 73 hits and 10 homeruns. The offense-oriented series raised the Golden Panther's team batting average to .307 and their team ERA to 2.97, the highest they've been this season.

FIU 9, Rutgers 7

Ammer "Friday Night" Cabrera (3-1) was the first FIU pitcher to face the hot bats of the Scarlet Knights. In seven and one-third innings of work, Cabrera allowed six runs (five earned), six hits, walked four and struck out another four batters to earn the win.

"I started bad right out of the trenches," said Cabrera. "Then, I settled down. Coach helped me get my head back in the game, and my team supporting me with the runs [also helped]."

Senior Dennis Diaz went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and a stolen base.

However, the player of the game was junior Nick Cadena. With the game tied at five in the bottom of the seventh inning, the third baseman hit a towering two-run homerun over the left field wall to give FIU a 7-5 lead they would never relinquish.

It was the second night in a row in which Cadena hit a two-run homerun in the bottom of the seventh inning. The first came against against Quinnipiac in the historic 1000th win for Price.

"I stuck with the same approach I had [in the previous game]," said Cadena. "I was just looking for a pitch to hit, put my best swing on it and [produced] the same result."

Senior Danny "The Vulture" Hernandez pitched the final one and two-third innings to earn his fourth save of the season.

FIU 10, Rutgers 14

A grand slam by junior Yahmed Yema wasn't enough as the FIU pitching staff struggled against Rutgers hitters and allowed five homeruns for the game. Rutgers scored in all but one inning (the fifth) in the game.

"I was disappointed we lost," said Price. "[In this game] you had to out-slug the other team. We weren't going to out-pitch them."  

Starting pitcher David Asher went five innings, allowed five runs, 10 hits, walked three and struck out five batters.

FIU took a 10-7 lead after it scored six runs in the bottom of the sixth - an inning that included the aforementioned grand slam. However, FIU pitching let up and FIU bats went cold as the Scarlet Knights scored seven unanswered runs in the final three innings of the game.

Junior relief pitcher Matt Rainey was saddled with his fourth loss of the season. 

The Texas native pitched two and one-third innings, allowed six runs, seven hits, two homeruns and struck out one batter.

FIU 9, Rutgers 0

In the final game of the series the Rutgers bats finally burned out, mainly due to an outstanding pitching performance from Elih Villanueva and a little help from the defense as well.

The freshman phenom pitched the first complete-game shutout of his young FIU career, struck out a career-high 13 batters and allowed only four hits.

"[In the first two games] they hit the ball away good," said Villanueva. "So I kept pitching inside and didn't let them hang over the plate to hit the ball [to the opposite field]."

Villanueva's outing did not stop FIU batters from producing as seven of their runs came off three homeruns. 

"This was the best game we've played so far this season," Price said. "[Rutgers] is a good ball club. They've beat some good teams."

Sophomore Cody Jacobs went 3-for-4 with two homeruns and five RBIs, his second two-homerun game of the season.

Junior Nick Cadena gave the Golden Panthers an early 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning, with his third two-run homerun in four games.

Jacobs had a three-run homerun in the fourth and a two-run homerun in the fifth.

The Golden Panthers reached the tournament's championship game for the fourth time this season, but came up just short of winning it all.

FIU reached the title game of the Blue & Gold Coca Cola Classic on March 13, but the team was not able to get past FAU, losing 3-2 in a 10-inning marathon. 

The game was the second longest in the all-time series between the Golden Panthers and the Owls. FAU won an 11-inning affair 2-1, back on April 21, 2000. Ten of the last 14 contests between the two teams have been decided by only one run. FIU also set a season record for at bats with 33 in the game.

"We had our chances against FAU. I'm very proud of the team effort, and I really had a great time coaching that game," said coach Kim Gwydir. 

For the tournament, FIU finished with a 3-3 record and improved to 18-12 overall. 

Tiffany Ore, Tabitha Embry and Ashley Falk were named to the all-tournament team for the Golden Panthers.

FAU 3, FIU 2

The winning run for the Owls came as Jessica Sachs reached on an error in the 10th, enabling Lauren Crandall to score from third, as FAU defeated the Golden Panthers 3-2 to claim the tournament title on March 13.

Ore took the loss for FIU after coming in to pitch in relief in the 10th inning. The loss drops Ore's record to 6-4 on the season. 

"The effort was there. Enthusiasm was there. It just didn't go our way. It's just one of those funny things," Gwydir said.

Megan Doonan picked up the win for FAU in her two innings of relief, as she improved her record to 4-6.

Amanda Nealer gave up two unearned runs and no walks while striking out six in nine innings of work for FIU, while Candice Freel allowed one run and struck out seven for the Owls.

FIU 2, Tulsa 1

The Golden Panthers added some extra excitement to their semi-final victory against Tulsa on March 13.

Embry came to the plate in the top of the seventh with the game tied at 1-1 and blasted an opposite field homerun. The homerun was Embry's second for the season, as it provided the game-winning run and placed the Golden Panthers in the championship game.

"I'm very impressed with how our team pulled together and came back against a good Tulsa team," Gwydir said.

Ore picked up her sixth win, as she improved to 6-3 on the season after pitching four scoreless innings of relief. She allowed just one hit while striking out six. 

Lindsay Dyer picked up the loss, falling to 5-2 for the year, after giving up two runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings.

FIU 9, Manhattan 0

After suffering a tough defeat against Tulsa in the afternoon game on March 12, the Golden Panthers came back to pound Manhattan 9-0.

FIU crushed the Jaspers in a five-inning mercy rule to advance to the semi-finals where the team got a rematch against Tulsa.

Nealer picked up the win for FIU as she improved her record to 8-6 for the season. Her nine strikeouts helped the Golden Panthers pick up their second one-hit shutout of the tournament.

The Golden Panthers scored two runs in the second inning, four in the third and capped off the win with a pinch-hit three-run blast from Ashley Falk.

Tulsa 1, FIU 0

Tiffany Ore got the start for the Golden Panthers and produced a solid pitching performance. She went six innings and allowed three hits, while striking out 11 in a losing effort. Ore fell to 5-3 for the season. 

"Unfortunately there's a bit of luck involved in with hitting and we're not getting much of it right now," Gwydir said.

The lone run of the game came in the second inning when Stephanie Sliepen smacked a solo home run over the left field wall.

The Golden Panthers left four runners stranded and had a runner caught trying to steal third on two separate occasions.

FIU 3, Quinnipiac 0

The Golden Panthers and Tiffany Ore had an overall stellar performance against Quinnipiac on March 11. Ore recorded a career-high 14 strikeouts, and the FIU team picked up a one-hit shutout, including a pair of homeruns.

The win improved Ore's record to 5-2 on the season, while Kim Norman fell to 1-1 with the loss for the Bobcats.

Brooke Ruiz went 4-for-6 with three runs batted in and a two-run homerun in the bottom of the first. The home run gives Ruiz two on the season.

Ore pitched a no-hitter through 5 2/3 innings, but Colleen Conlin reached on an infield single for the Bobcats only hit of the game.

FAU 3, FIU 2

The Owls capped off a seventh inning rally as Jessica Braggins hit a single to right with the bases loaded and two outs, scoring two runs and lifting FAU over the Golden Panthers 3-2.

FIU jumped out in front early in the first inning on Ruiz's RBI single, but was not able to hold on to the lead, losing the final game of the evening on March 11.

"Pitching is doing its job. We just need to improve our hitting in clutch situations," Gwydir said.

Meghan Doonan picked up the win for FAU, as they improved to 10-19, scattering two runs on five hits while striking out five in seven innings of work. Amanda Nealer struck out 11 batters in the loss, falling 7-6 on the season. Nealer's effort marked her fourth double-digit strikeout performance of the year.

Subheadline: A GROWING EPIDEMIC
Author: Jamie Blanco / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
I stood there with deflated fervor as I watched the retreating back of a fellow student, contemplating his last statement to me. 

"If it were for kids in another country or something I would do it," said the student, concerning the raffle tickets I was selling (the proceeds of which would aid homeless shelters in South Florida). 

"Why should I give my money to bums who aren't going to get a job anyways?" he added.

 Perhaps it's because 1,800 of those "bums" last year were children - thousands of American children living in extreme poverty, fighting hunger and the exposure of street life. 

Of these children, most have simply had the misfortune of being born into poverty or abusive homes. 

They have little or no education, health care, support system or hope for a better future. They are hardly ever recognized as substantial parts of the homeless community, thus prevailing stereotypes fail to see them and their needs.

The Miami-Dade County website reports that 80 percent of all people in the county are just two paychecks away from being homeless. This condition is due to drug addictions, alcoholism and domestic abuse, as well as unfortunate circumstances such as disease or the loss of a main household provider. 

Eighty percent may sound like an inflated number, but step back and imagine how a total lack of income for two months would put anyone hopelessly behind on payments for homes, cars, insurance etc, especially if one enjoys a high standard of living. 

According to the U.S. Mayors Conference report in 2002, "It is remarkable that over the last decade the percent of the homeless population consisting of families with children has climbed from 32 percent to more than 40 percent. 

Two thirds of the United States homeless population consists of families with children or single women and unaccompanied youth. More than one in five of the homeless work, many at full time jobs that do not pay enough to rent an apartment.

"Sometimes we didn't have the money or time to buy little things like toothpaste," recalls a freshman, who prefers to remain nameless, about his family being on welfare after a brief time of homelessness, "I remember going to school one, day we had to brush our teeth with soap," he added.

In president Bush's proposed budget, he provides $200 million for selected homeless programs but cuts four billion dollars from the Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 

These cuts are poised to debilitate programs that target people living below the federal poverty threshold. 

It will also severely harm programs that provide affordable, safe housing to disabled people, AIDs patients, immigrants, Native Americans and poverty-stricken individuals and families.

Bush says he aims to end "chronic homelessness," yet this label overemphasizes a 10 percent portion of the homeless population that will remain homeless for many years. 

It contributes to the prevailing stereotypes about "bums" while leaving those who try to move out of their situations with fewer options.

In 2002, the waiting list for public housing in Los Angeles was three years, while here in Miami it was an astonishing seven-year wait. With affordable housing programs being slashed even further, it leaves many families in desperate situations with no other alternative than to live on the street.

These cuts are only a small part of the $413 billion cut in domestic spending requested by the president, while he simultaneously promotes a $1.3 trillion extension of his tax breaks that benefit mainly the most wealthy individuals and businesses in the nation. 

The community needs to know that every dollar donated to reputable organizations does bring good. The local Homeless Voice Newspaper, for example, has a distribution of 70,000 papers, and with a donation of at least $1 for each, they are able to run their shelter month by month.

Other programs are taking people off the streets and into jobs. In 2003, the Homeless Assistance Program helped 4,539 people find work and residential placement while the Miami Rescue Mission placed 174 people. That's about as large as my entire graduating class.

There are several ways the public can effectively aid the fight against homelessness. 

Some organizations suggest that instead of giving handouts or food, which can actually enable the homeless to remain in their current position, it is better to offer them an opportunity. 

An opportunity can be anything from handing them a job listing or paying them to carry your groceries.

If you decide to do something about it, every effort can do some good in the life of a man, woman or child. Let's not silence the voices of the American children in need; they deserve to be recognized, to have every chance to live the American dream.

Subheadline: Fair to affect availability of parking at uP
Author: Harry Coleman / Editor in Chief
&nbsp;
Students at the University Park campus will experience an increase in traffic and a limit in available parking spots March 17 through April 3. This is because the Miami-Dade County Youth Fair and Exposition will be taking place at the neighboring Tamiami Park, which has been home to the fair for 54 years.

In a memorandum sent to all FIU departments, Michael H. Wright, acting director for the Department of Public Safety, stated that there will be certain times when fair patrons will be utilizing a majority of the parking areas at FIU.

According to the Miami-Dade County Fair Expo Center website, the fair is a major supporter of FIU. The fair not only contributed two million dollars to the FIU community, but it also donated $1.4 million toward the Wertheim Performing Arts Center at the UP campus. 

The fair has partnered with the county and FIU to design and organize shared parking and the development of a Metro Dade bus terminal. The terminal, which has allowed for additional student parking, will be closed during the fair.

"Parking Lot Five, located just east of the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, will be closed and used for staging/preparation by the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition [throughout the duration of the event]," Wright said in the memorandum.

Not only will Parking Lot Five be closed for the 18-day event, but students who park in the Blue and Gold Garages might have a hard time finding parking after 9 p.m.

"My understanding is that [fair visitors] are going to use the Blue and Gold garage, and they are only going to be used after nine o'clock at night. That is what [fair officials] told us," said Parking and Traffic department coordinator, Lazaro E. Rodriguez.

Despite the rise in visitors that will be using the garages closest to the fair grounds, Parking Lot Six, located on the west side of the WPAC, has been designated exclusively as a residential housing parking lot.

"Lot Six is not going to be used at all [by fair visitors]. It is going to be used exclusively by housing students," Rodriguez said. "As a matter of fact, we are going to post a couple patrollers on that site to prevent people from parking in there. We will go out of our way to prevent any guests for the Youth Fair to park in Lot Six from 5 to 10 p.m."

Some students see the changes in parking during the fair and the use of the garages by fair patrons as unfair.

"I think that it is inconsiderate for the students [who need to park in the garages] especially for those who are coming to class at night," said junior Gary Vasquez.

Although students may be concerned about parking in the garages, they should not be worried about being ticketed.

"Will we give out tickets during the Youth Fair? Most likely it's not going got happen. But it depends on the violation," Rodriguez said. "We ticket until 7 p.m. when it comes to the garages, but under the guidelines of the rules and regulations that we have, it depends on the violation. There are violations that are enforced 24 hours a day."

As of press time and despite several attempts to reach officials of the Department of Public Safety, no information could be gathered as to how the added traffic will flow through or around FIU.

The Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition is a not-for-profit organization that raises funds that support youth and adult achievement programs. Privately owned and operated by the Not-for-Profit Corporation and governed by a volunteer board of directors, the fair awards over $500,000 each year in scholarships, awards and premiums. 

Last year over 800,000 guests attended the fair.

FIU to train intelligence analysts

A consortium of intelligence-gathering agencies in Washington, D.C., has selected FIU to lead the development of academic programs that will produce well-trained and more diverse intelligence analysts.

The grant FIU received as part of an initiative seeking to diversify the ranks of its different agencies awarded by the U.S. Intelligence Community to the Jack D. Gordon Institute for Policy and Citizenship Studies at FIU's Center for Transnational and Comparative Studies (TCS).

"What we proposed is not very different from classes already offered here and at every university," said Ralph Clem, TCS's director and a professor of international relations. "The program would coordinate all these subjects and add others to produce graduates who are competitive for jobs in Washington, D.C."

The grant gives FIU $750,000 for the 18-month pilot program, which could then be renewed over four years for up to $3 million. 

Mark B. Rosenberg, FIU's provost and vice president for academic affairs, added that the new initiative will also provide substantial scholarship funds, which will be awarded on a competitive basis. Those scholarships would support advanced language and other academic training.

Music education requirements to change

Students enrolled in the FIU music education program have been voicing complaints after the Florida Legislature asked for an increase in requirements for all students majoring in education across the state.

According to the students' complaints, the new rule, enforced by the Florida Department of Education, will add extra credit requirements to their already full course load.

Students majoring in music education already take credit hours to satisfy the university core curriculum, as well as classes within the School of Music and the necessary required credits needed to enter the program.

With the new rule in place, students will be required to take an additional 24 credits, rounding out their total undergraduate credits to 120.

"When all the requirements that must be met by music majors for [the National Association of Schools of [Music] and those mandated by the Florida Department of Education for education are added together, the number of credits for completion of a degree in music education becomes exorbitant," said Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at the College of Education, Adriana McEachern, through e-mail.

Though McEachern said she has been discussing the problem with Donna Gollnick, senior vice president for National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education - the organization which accredited the College of Education - "in the hopes that something could be done to alleviate the burden for our music majors," nothing has been resolved so far.

Administrators within the College of Arts and Sciences and members of the music education program would not comment on the situation.

Not one FIU student attended Catholic Mass Feb. 24 in the Biscayne Bay Campus Wolfe University Center. 

Student Alan Castillo, a sophomore majoring in journalism, arrived after Mass was already over. 

"During the fall term, I frequently attended Mass. I don't think I missed Mass on Thursdays, but since I have another job during the morning on Thursdays and I ride the bus, I don't get to Mass [on time]," said Castillo. 

Castillo is a member of the Catholic Student Association, which organizes BBC's Mass every Thursday at 12:30 p.m. The Mass is the association's only regular meeting at FIU. 

The club members also volunteer at the Pines Nursing Home one Saturday a month, where they sing and play games like Hangman and Trivia, with patients. On Good Friday, March 25, they will meet at the Miami-based Missionaries of Charity.

On Feb. 24, however, Sister Kayjoy Cooper was the only person who attended the on-campus Mass. She is from the Convent of the Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in North Miami.

Cooper sat alone diligently in the front, listening to Youth Minister Brandon Bach.  

"I have many choices of where to go to Mass on any particular day. You know, there are half a dozen parishes around here with different mass times," said Cooper. "But I like very much to celebrate the Eucharist with the people our campus minister Brandon Bach gathers together - young adults and a priest leader."

According to Cooper, young college students have dedicated much of their time to secular education and may have misconceptions about religion. Cooper said she and other members of her congregation go to places like FIU and invite young people into their convent to be a Catholic presence for them.

"It's very valuable for our next world leaders ... to break through malformed ideas [toward] an image of the true God, a loving and freeing God," she said.

However, even the priest leader, Father Christian Plancher - who's pursuing a graduate degree at FIU - didn't make it to Mass, because he was away at a retreat. He met for the first time with members of the Catholic Student Association at a barbecue last summer and agreed to give Mass on campus every Thursday, which is usually his day off. 

The Eucharist - the consecration of bread and wine into Christ's flesh and blood - was not given that Thursday, because only priests can perform the rites. Instead, Bach, the layperson minister, invited Cooper to read a passage from the Bible at the podium.

He asked for a moment of prayer. Sister Cooper then offered a lone prayer for college students.

Bach cited some explanations for the attendance problems such as FIU only allowing flyers to stay up for about a week, people having too many flyers to look at already and students not taking enough interest in the campus ministry because they go home or to their jobs after classes. 

Castillo said setting up informational tables around campus and more entertainment might also increase attendance at Mass. Bach agreed and said he could also bring some music ministers to campus.

On Feb. 17, Reverend Felipe J. Estevez from the Archdiocese of Miami, was brought in as a special guest to perform Mass at FIU. Only about 10 people attended.   

Bach sees the Catholic Student Association as a community to help students get through college and into adulthood, giving them "support and strength in a Catholic way." 

On Feb. 24, Bach stood by himself before a banner trying to convince students to attend Mass. When he asked a student if she was going to attend, she shook her head indifferently and walked away.
