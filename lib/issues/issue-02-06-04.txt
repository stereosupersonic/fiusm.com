Headline: Apathetic students lack spirit of protest, awareness
Author: Vanessa Lopez / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
I'm sure we've all heard the stories, if not from our parents then from some other source: the Hippie generation of the sixties made their voices heard, took to the streets in protest, actively standing up for the issues that moved them. College campuses at the time were a hotbed for civil rights protests and active discussion. 

Nowadays, take a walk around FIU, and it's hard to imagine something like that ever happening.

Initially, I figured that the mind-numbing apathy that plagues so many was not just contained to just FIU, and it in the grand scheme of things it isn't. The majority of American citizens nowadays find it difficult to work up the motivation to vote. 

After visiting many other college campuses, however, I've realized that FIU really does have a certain level of apathy that seems almost unparalleled. It's almost as if this campus is asleep – the biggest things that seem to move us are frat scandals, and even those don't seem to spark our interest as much as they used to. 

Perhaps one of the reasons for it is the fact that FIU is for the most part a commuter school, and students just don't get involved as much as they otherwise might. 

To me though, that still doesn't explain the total obvious I've encountered. I've spoken to people who looked at me in disbelief when I mentioned Miami has a film festival, got upset that "The Vagina Monologues" had the audacity to show the word "vagina" in public (kind of hard not to considering it's in the title), and after hearing about certain important social issues have actually remarked to our professor, "well, I like being dumb and happy." 

FIU aside, it's hard to pinpoint exactly why our generation in general is so apathetic.  Many have expressed that the Hippie generations simply were in the midst of a revolution; Vietnam, drugs and the sexual revolution fueled their fire. 

But it is not like there are not plenty of important issues to go around. 

Right in our own backyard there is a frightening movement to repeal Miami's Human Rights Ordinance, an act that prevents discrimination based on sexual orientation. Important social issues are brewing all around us, it's all a matter of caring –  of being involved in the world around you.  

Every now and then, I notice groups of people who seem so oblivious to the real world it's almost as if they exist apart from it, living in a place where ignorance is bliss. I always wonder what it is that they talk about amongst themselves. I think one of my friends put it best when he said, "The talk to their cell phones, not each other."

Headline: In Our View: FIU sports teams need student support to gain media attention
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
With the success of the women's basketball team and, more recently, the men's baseball team, it's reasonable to think FIU sports would gain some much-deserved recognition. 

Unfortunately, with UM just around the corner, Golden Panthers usually get overshadowed in the local media.  

Despite FIU's many successes, it seems the Hurricanes draw the most media attention and support. This year, the FIU men's baseball team beat the Hurricanes two out of their three games and managed to enter the regionals as the number two seed, while UM came in at third.  

Yet somehow, the focus of many local newspapers and sports shows was blatantly centered around the Hurricanes.  

The baseball team is not the only FIU sports team to suffer from lack of support and representation from the media.  The women's basketball team was doubly overshadowed for being not only FIU team, but also a women's team.

College sports and athletes depend on a fanbase that includes the citizens of their hometowns for the much-needed support and enthusiasm that spurs their programs on. What's it going to take for Miami to notice FIU?  

With the thousands of colleges in the US, sports teams are a good way to get a school's name out to the general public. For this to happen, however, a team must have more than just a high number in the win column. 

FIU teams like men's baseball and women's basketball have had much success, and yet still haven't gained proper recognition.  

Loyal fan support is an important element – support that creates the necessary energy and excitement that draws the attention of others. 

Unfortunately, if most students can't muster enthusiasm for their own teams and school, then we can't really expect the media and the rest of Miami to take notice.

Headline: Cold war mentality stifles American-Cuban relations
Subheadline: Carter's trip to Cuba demonstrates need for more open discussion of issues
Author: Jason Andreasen
&nbsp;
Due to the large and ever-growing exile population in Miami, discussion of Cuba always starts tempers boiling. In fact the population has grown so much that the exile community's view is all but seen as the view of Miami and all of its citizens. 

However, there are more and more voices being raised from Miami calling for at least the debate and discussion of American-Cuban relations.

It is time for all of the people of Miami, exile or not, to open their minds to real discussion of the issues.

Recently, former President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba to address the United States' approach to dealing with the communist nation. Many would not exactly cite President Carter as one of the most effective leaders the U.S. has ever seen; however, as a statesman, Carter has made a considerable name for himself. 

Also, to those who think that Carter might be ignorant to the plight of the Cuban people or the Cuban exiles, it is important to note that he was instrumental in allowing the Mariel Boat-lift, which allowed thousands of Cuban people to immigrate to the United States. 

As President Carter's recent trip to the communist nation revealed, our relations with Cuba have reached a stalemate. We have maintained a Cold War mentality towards Cuba, one that has become severely outdated. The embargo that has riddled the island nation with poverty has helped lead to economic disparity throughout the country. 

Meanwhile, the average American who might wish to travel to the once popular tourist spot is prohibited from doing so without a having to weed through a mountain of red tape and take the risk of engaging in a possibly illegal action. In many ways, we pay little diplomatic attention to Cuba, making Carter the first president to have visited the country since Castro came to power. 

By no means do I contend that Fidel Castro is anything less than an authoritative dictator who has hurt Cuba. 

His communist ways are not favored by the U.S., and posed an extremely dangerous and volatile situation during the Cold War. 

Of course, the Cold War is over. What has become painfully obvious is that our policy towards Cuba has not crippled the communist government in the way we had anticipated. Instead, it has simply assisted Castro in oppressing the Cuban people. 

As Carter pointed out during his recent trip, the people of Cuba need economic help more than they need political reform. 

President Carter, wearing a guayabera (a popular type of shirt in Cuba), spoke out about changing our relations with Cuba. While he was calling for a reevaluation of American policies toward Cuba, he was also denouncing the Cuban government for all its wrongs over the years. Without any censorship, Carter denounced Castro's government for human rights violations and called for democracy on the island nation. 

He publicly endorsed the increasingly popular Project Varela, a movement towards freedom of expression and the right to change laws peacefully. 

This kind of speech struck the Cuban people. Rarely do they hear such critical talk of the government on such a large scale.

In reaction to Carter's speech from Cuba, President Bush traveled to Miami to make a speech affirming his stance on the state of affairs between the U.S. and Cuba. 

He spoke before a number of Cuban exiles and Representatives like Rep. Diaz-Balart and Rep. Ros-Lehtinen. 

However, instead of listening to the recommendations of President Carter, Bush decided it would be more prudent to come to South Florida and pander to the Hispanic vote by shouting "¡Cuba Libre!," and telling them that he would not sign off on an end to the forty-year old embargo. 

And of course, I'm sure that this has nothing to do with the upcoming congressional elections in which two Republican seats are up for grabs. 

 What does this say about our President?

The way that we act towards our nation's dealings with Cuba needs to change, not only throughout the country, but especially in South Florida. 

No matter how one feels about the U.S.'s approach towards Cuba, it would seem that the least we could hope for, and expect, would be an open-minded discussion instead of a steel-trapped Cold War mindset.

Headline: Exciting "Sum" adds up to fun
Author: Jorge Montes / Production Manager
&nbsp;
Right about here, 90 per cent of critics would go into a diatribe about the movie "The Sum of All Fears" and the events of 9/11. This diatribe would have one of the following opinions: (a) It's too soon. (b) What was once fiction now seems real and scary. (c) Blah, blah, terrorists, blah, blah, bombs, blah, blah, Hollywood, blah, blah, escape from reality.
I say screw all that. Let's review the film.

The essential story is about a missing nuclear bomb and how it is used to turn the United States and Russia against each other by some Neo-Nazi Russians with a grudge against the current government. But really what the story is about is one Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck), a naïve, somewhat cocky but never to the point of annoying CIA analyst who gets caught up in a world-wide political thriller all because he wrote some report that accurately guessed who was next in line for the Russian Presidency.

For about half the movie, we watch as Ryan learns from CIA Director Bill Cabot (Morgan Freeman) about the real nitty-gritty of the CIA. Cabot and apparently everyone else in the movie, takes a liking to the doe-eyed "aww, shucks" façade Ryan hides his brains under, particularly when Ryan tries to show of his intelligence and it ends up promptly putting his foot directly into his mouth, which results in more Affleck "aww, shucks"ing. For this reason (or maybe he just sees something in Ryan we can't), Cabot takes Ryan under his wing.

Thankfully, Affleck seems to have finally gotten rid of that: "Gee, I'm making a movie" face he normally dons through most of his flicks. The only time he does have it is during his romantic scenes with Ryan's girlfriend, Cathy (Bridget Moynahan). Though he's still light-years away from ever becoming a great actor, at least audiences no longer have to fear bad acting right out of "Armageddon," "Pearl Harbor" or, God forbid, "Bounce." He's got past "barely tolerable" and even "tolerable" and into "competent." He's come of age, so to speak.

Even more thankfully, and more importantly, director Phil Alden Robinson manages to make Ryan's "induction" into his new life in the CIA riveting. We, the audience, get pulled along into the plot because we ourselves feel like Ryan, looking around the Kremlin like: "This is so cool that I get to see this." The political thriller aspect of the story manages to stay interesting at the same time, with only one or two rough spots early on, where audiences are left trying to understand what political hog-wash a movie politician is spewing next. Yes, folks: In Hollywood, politicians can't keep quiet either, even the Neo-Nazi Russian ones. 

Unfortunately, the film falls under the throng of "Bruckheimer syndrome" for quite a bit of the third act. Everything the film's been working for in style and substance is chucked out the window for a sudden burst of an absolutely bland excuse for action. During the moments before the climax, Ryan escapes death approximately three times. Once from a fat, bald guy with chains who appears out of nowhere; once from something that managed to kill just about everyone else and absolutely no one at the same time; and once because the dumb-ass rather read a palm pilot than keep his eyes on the damned road.

Also to note during this third act: Somehow, in what appears to be a timeframe of thirty minutes (it could be forty, they weren't specific), Ryan travels from the outskirts of Baltimore to just about every friggin' location IN Baltimore, including, but not limited to, a fire station, two hospitals (technically, one appears to be an instaclinic, the kind that pops out of tents with the push of a button), the docks, the front window of a convenience store, a radiation laboratory (actually, I have reason to believe this lab was from the makers of instaclinic) and the Pentagon. Now, I realize Affleck is playing Daredevil in an upcoming movie, but did he have to turn Jack Ryan into The Flash?

Thankfully, during the climax of the movie, Robinson remembered he was making a political thriller and not "Die Hard Lite" and gives audiences a resolution that safisfies quite nicely. It's not any nifty surprise twist (right before Ryan comes up with his brilliant plan, I was thinking "I bet he…"), but it still manages to come off as clever, daring and, dare I say it, cool.

Of course, what really helps the development of the story, which can be very talky, is a supporting cast that you really want to listen to. From Philip Baker Hall to James Cromwell as the President of the United States, everyone who isn't Jack Ryan or Bill Cabot manages to add heft and intrigue to their characters without actually having to flesh them out. 
The only misfire casting: Liev Schreiber as John Clark. His commando character is a very bland and generic role that needs a unique actor to pull off the part convincingly. Anyone could've told Hollywood that Schreiber is not unique. He's as bland as they come. 

Speaking of bad casting, there's something I forgot at the beginning of this review: (d) Ben Affleck is completely wrong for Jack Ryan. Most critics say this because they are uptight little film brats who can't get over Affleck playing the young version of a character once played by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford, while keeping the film in modern times. They can't come to grips with the fact that this film can be based on the exact same character in many different Clancy novels, while completely being independent of other Clancy films. They're not even critiquing his acting. To them, I simply say: "Grow up."

Headline: "Undercover Brother" trades on racial stereotypes
Author: Andrew Plummer
&nbsp;
Contrived and altogether monotonous tripe completely devoid of intelligent humor or even laughable antics: this is "Undercover Brother." Filling every frame with the maximum amount of exhausted stereotypes and hackneyed racial humor, the film is more suitable for an illiterate mob of chimpanzees than a theatre filled with people wishing to maintain some standard of intellectual dignity when viewing comedy.

 The film is based on an Internet comic series and certainly should have remained as such. Undercover Brother, played by Eddie Griffin, is a modern day "Robin Hood from the hood" who capers about in ridiculous 70's garb, which gets progressively more irritating as the film proceeds and he causes more and more generic mischief for the exploiters of the oppressed. Predictably, the character becomes involved with an underground faction known as B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., an organization focused on foiling the bigoted plots of their archenemy The Man (Robert Trumbull), and proceeds to bungle his way through several clichéd "secret agent" backdrops.

 The members of B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D prove to be just as, if not more, disturbing than Griffin's ever-present swarthy smirk. With a supporting cast that includes Dave Chappelle (Conspiracy Brother) and Denise Richards (Penelope Snow/ White She- Devil) what can be expected but an annoyingly high pitched squeal of histrionic drivel spouted from a lackluster comedian clinging to an exhausted trick voice that attempts, but patently fails, to pass as comedy, and a tragically ill-cast, dimwitted poster girl more suitable for giving away free advice at a Clinique counter than giving an honest effort at a performance in a Hollywood movie. 

As the film progresses Griffin's physical comedy grows as tiresome as the presence of underdeveloped characters that receive little to no screen time. Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan) and The Man comprise the collusion of evil in the film. However, their screen time is limited to whenever Griffin finishes cavorting about in his bewildering attempt at humor. 

The tortuous tandem conspires to create a mind control serum and distribute it throughout the African American community in doses hidden in buckets of fried chicken. Billy D. Williams plays General Boutwell, a parody of Colin Powell, who, under the influence of the mind control serum, founds the fast food chain that will distribute the psychedelic chicken. 

Perhaps if the box office administered the psychedelic serum to the audience members, the film would have been slightly more entertaining. The comedy suddenly concludes as a tragedy as the careers of Kattan, Williams, and up-and-coming actress Aunjanue Ellis (Sistah Girl) will indubitably be forever marred by their appearances in this cinematic catastrophe. The only thing worse than Chappelle's and Griffin's caterwauling is the failure of the intentional stereotypes to intelligently or humorously comment on any current social issue concerning the marginalizing of any race. As for comedy, the rehashing and regurgitation of somewhat sanctified black-power films is hardly a sound source. If moviegoers wish to be subjected to an hour and a half of comedic detritus, this is the film of choice.

Headline: Latin rock legends Mana prepare new album
Author: Lena Hansen
&nbsp;
Maná, the Mexican band currently eulogized as the greatest Latin Rock band, emerged from the streets of Guadalajara in the late 70s, when disco music monopolized the airwaves and people were too busy "boogie-oogie-ooging" to value their distinctive sound. The band's original 'founding fathers' were Fernando (Fher), Abraham, Juan and his brother Ulises. Before they were Maná, they called themselves The Green Hat Spies and performed rookie renditions of classics from Led Zepellin, Peter Frampton, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones at local birthday parties, graduations, bohemian bars and clubs.

 Their albums didn't always fly off the racks; their first three productions Sombrero Verde, A Ritmo de Rock, and Maná got very little recognition and sold well under 50,000 copies each. Abraham got discouraged and decided to leave the band, which time proved to be the wrong choice.
In 1985, Alejandro González (Alex), a drummer with a Colombian-Cuban background, joined the band and proved to be the secret ingredient to cook up the group's greatest hits. In 1986, the band finally changed their name to Maná, a term that was taken from a biblical passage and literally means "the bread that falls from the sky."

 Their name and their fate were not the only things that changed. They sprinkled their rock sound with Latin spices and added hints of Salsa, Calypso, Pop, Reggae and Afro-Cuban seasoning to their mouth-watering recipe. In 1989, the prestigious record label Warner Music Mexico skeptically signed the band, and Maná recorded their first successful album. Falta Amor sold over 75,000 copies and conquered the airwaves with hits like "Rayando el Sol" and "Perdido en un Barco," which later became classics. Among other recognitions, Falta Amor won them ten gold and five platinum discs. It was also selected by Billboard magazine as the Best Album, crowning Maná as the Best Pop Rock Band. 

In 1992, the group recorded their second record-breaking album ¿Dónde Jugarán los Niños? (Where Will the Children Play?) which sold over 5 million copies. It contained an array of memorable themes like "Oye mi amor," "Vivir sin Aire," "Te Lloré Todo un Río" and "Me Vale." "Vivir sin Aire," a heart-breaking ballad that suggests love as a physiological and essential element for human growth, touched millions of listeners with its sincere pleading. 

It asked: "How could a fish swim without water?/ How could a bird fly without wings?/ How could a flower grow without soil?/ If only I could live without you." "Vivir Sin Aire" won the MTV Latino award for Best Music Video. 

That same year Ulises Calleros left the stage to become the group's manager. Maná was now a trio, and they were desperately searching for their missing piece. Guitarist Sergio Vallín was the answer to their prayers, and fit perfectly into their rare puzzle. In 1995, Maná collaborated in the soundtrack for the movie "My Family" with the theme "Celoso," a classic they borrowed from Los Panchos. Their fame never jeopardized their concern for social issues. Their poetic lyrics always speak in favor of human rights and environmental causes. 

In 1995, they founded the charity organization Selva Negra (Black Jungle), destined to raise funds for the preservation of our flora and fauna. 

In 1996 the band was honored with a Grammy nomination in the category of "Best Latin Pop Album" for their masterpiece Cuando los Angeles Lloran (When Angels Cry), which sold over 1,500,000 copies the year it was released. This nomination opened the doors of the Anglo market to the Mexican band, and placed them within the "Spanish Rock" genre. They shocked the world after winning six Billboard awards in only three years. 

In 1997 the band recorded the album Sueños Líquidos (Liquid Dreams), which some consider their best work to date. Sueños Líquidos was simultaneously released in 26 countries, and sold over 300,000 copies just 10 days after its debut. Although it was in Spanish, the album was number 67 on Billboard's top 200 hits in the US, and was number one on Billboard's 50 Hot Latin Tracks. Their concert tour was the most extensive tour ever conducted by a Latin artist throughout the US. 
After stumbling upon this milestone in their career, Maná continued to dazzle their fans. They performed at "Hard Rock Live" in Guadalajara in 1998, recorded the album "Maná Unplugged" in collaboration with MTV in 1999 and worked with the master of Latin cross-over music, Carlos Santana, on the making of his amazing CD Supernatural. 

After four years away from the recording studios, Maná will release a new album in October. Fher recently stated that this new production "will be very risky, preserving Maná's essence, but containing different musical fusions that will be manifested in the 12 or 14 themes the album will include." It is still in the works, but Maná's fans will surely be pleased with the news. 

The unique sensibility and poetic quality of its lyrics and the authenticity of its sound, make this Mexican band a rare avis in the world of pop music.

Headline: Creepy "Insomnia" battles sleep
Author: Amanda Healy
&nbsp;
It seems that lately, suspense-filled murder mysteries are following a new trend of allowing all sides to have flaws – even the good guys. These are not just tiny faults either. No, now it is getting harder and harder to tell the heroes from the villains. "Insomnia" is no exception. 
Usually our champions' imperfections are easy to overlook because of some redeeming factor they possess or some convincing explanation for their bad decisions. However, "Insomnia" just allows the protagonist to dig himself deeper and deeper into the blackness of a messed-up life. For the hero of "Insomnia," once you start down the wrong path there is no turning back. This is a very upsetting lesson indeed, one that may be a little too heavy for most movie audiences.  

"Insomnia" is the latest work from Christopher Nolan, the same director as the mind-bending thriller "Memento." Christopher Nolan once again demonstrates his unique style with this film. There is something about Nolan's syncopated cinematography that adds a sense of fear and desperation to the mood – an atmosphere that works very well for reeling the audience in. The sudden flashes of images that occasionally interrupt the film's regular flow take any viewer right into the mind of the character on screen. This is a great technique for projecting, and evoking, suspense and urgency. 

Al Pacino plays Detective Will Dormer, a veteran policeman who has quite a few job-related skeletons in his closet. Regardless of this fact, it is obvious that Dormer at least wants justice to be served. Dormer operates on the belief that the end justifies the means, and it is because of this that Dormer is ironically, on the verge of seeing a jail cell from the inside out. Dormer's past is about to catch up with him because Internal Affairs is cracking down on his department, digging up all of the muck. This is the point that Dormer is at when he's assigned to fly out to Alaska in order to investigate a small-town murder. Here is where the insomnia aspect comes in, for Alaska is in the midst of everlasting day, midnight sun – the time of year when the sun never sets. It is that environmental factor, joined with Dormer's many worries and fears, that keeps him awake for the duration of the film.

Robin Williams plays Pacino's antagonist, Walter Finch; though it is not an easy job deciding who is the better man. In an intriguing turn of events, the film's villain is turned into Dormer's accomplice as the detective is forced to cooperate with the very man he is supposed to be arresting. Hilary Swank plays a local detective, Ellie Burr, whose sole purpose in the movie is to inject a bit of hope into the film's resolution. Unfortunately, this angle is not too effective by the time it is put into play because the movie is already too bleak and intense to allow the audience to leave unshaken. 

Thus, the hope that Burr is attempting to inject into the tale is doomed to insignificance when placed among the rest of the story's events. She is a silent observer, calmly and deliberately solving the crime on her own, with just as much success as Dormer himself. The point here is that Burr is a very promising officer – she, obviously, is just as good as Dormer and represents the upcoming generation of detectives. The point of her character is to answer the question of whether or not the police force will follow along the same path as Dormer. 

Swank's character was also an attempt at giving Pacino's character some moral support, but this aspect was also underdeveloped as their relationship is suddenly halted. 

The majority of the plot is focused upon the interaction between Williams and Pacino, forcing the rest of the cast into the sidelines. Not to say that the two screen legends were unimpressive in their performances, it just seemed that the whole movie would have been as complete had it only told of their cat-and-mouse chase.

Williams wandered into new territory when taking this role and he does very well. His trademark childlike persona adds much to a wicked character, because it only makes him seem all the more insane. His well-known persona worked perfectly and even brought a few chills down many an audience-member's spine. Pacino also, once again, dazzled the screen with his lofty presence. But then, is it even possible to see Pacino on the silver screen without automatically feeling admiration and respect? 

The cast of "Insomnia" was basically all-around decent, only the movie itself was very dark – ironic, considering the film's setting. No doubt, the film was well-made and the story excellent, as far as murder mysteries go. A viewer just needs to be ready for a lot of suspense and a large dose of reality – there is nothing sugarcoated about this film.

Headline: "Spirit" thrills young at heart
Author: Heather Brummer
&nbsp;
He's no Mr. Ed, but Spirit is galloping his way into young viewers' hearts this week. DreamWorks celebrated Memorial Day with the release of their newest feature film, "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," this past weekend. 

This beautiful film is one of several animated successes that have been released over the past few years, and seems to be indicative of many to come. DreamWorks already plans to release five new animated features within the next three years.

"Spirit" is a movie about a horse that has grown up in the wild. He is kind and gentle, but also free and the leader of the herd. Set in the wild west some time during the 1800's, Spirit is caught amidst the chaos of cowboys and Indians and the fighting that surrounds him. 

Naïve to the possibility of ever knowing anything but freedom, Spirit is caught by the Cavalry in an attempt to break him.

The film follows Spirit's courageous and admirable journey as he escapes the obstacles before him, making a few good friends along the way. 
Young audiences seem to have fallen in love with "Spirit," as is evident in seeing and hearing their reactions to key moments in the film. The lessons, however, will be worth seeing for both children and adults alike. 
"Spirit" teaches us about the power of kindness and the courage to fight for what is right. It is encouraging to see a film about horses (and animals in general, for that matter) that do not speak. "Spirit" does not talk in the film but conveys his emotions to the audience through facial expressions and sounds that real animals make. 

Studios, take note: We understood each and every moment that horse was experiencing and not once did he have to break into song to maintain our attention.

Though the plot may be somewhat predictable for us older folks, there is most certainly going to be at least one or two aspects of the film that will keep us watching. 

Of particular focus should be the animation, which is first class. Anyone who has ever attempted to draw a horse knows that it is not an easy task, but the animators obviously took their work to heart this time. Each scene is so beautifully drawn, it can only be described as breathtaking. 
Finally, although this is considered to be a family film, it is not devoid of reality. The situations between the cowboys and Indians aren't candy-coated and life is portrayed very close to what actually took place in the time "Spirit" was set. Don't go in with high hopes of seeing a big-hug-and-forgive-all scene at the end of the film because if this is the case, you will be disappointed. 

If, however, you are looking for the story of a horse with an unbreakable spirit, this is a great choice. One way or another, "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is sure to be a hit for both the young and the young at heart.
