Headline: Popular student facilities get relocated: Wellness center, Campus Life, Cafeteria, shuffle around
Author: Christina Lemus / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a year of planning, the Biscayne Bay Campus' Wellness Center and Campus Life will move to the third floor of the Wolfe University Center. 

"Improvement of student access necessitated the move." Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education, said. "Students will have greater access to many of the Wellness Center services that they do not take advantage of because the center is not in the mainstream, If it is raining, students can't go. So we hope this move into the Wolfe University Center will create more synergy and more access for students."

The idea to relocate the Wellness center came about a year ago when the Fitness Center was planning its move to the first floor of the Wolfe University Center. Jones plans to meet with the directors of the Wellness Center and Campus Life to discuss the needs for each department and allocating them amongst the 3,000 square ft. previously occupied by the old fitness center. The space will likely be divided into two separate offices to accomodate both departments.

"Students will benefit from a new Wellness Center because the current one is as old as the Biscayne Bay Campus and is in need of extensive repairs," Greg Olson, senior director of Student Affairs, said.

Currently, the Wellness Center is located in a module on one side of the BBC library, It offers student services such as health and nutrition presentations, acupuncture, massages, yoga, and free HIV testing. The departments of Campus Life, which includes SGA and Student Programming Council, however, are crowded into one office on the first floor of WUC. 

According to Katiana Saintable, BBC's Student Government Association President, the remaining departments of Campus Life will have more space in their current office at WUC 150. Yet, a timeline is still needed to determine the moving process.

"We still need the demographics of the available space to decide which [part] of Campus Life will best fit the available space in the Wellness Center," Saintable said. "Then FIU has to plan a design with an architect and then eventually start the construction.

According to Cathy Akens, assistant vice president of Student Affairs, the cost of moving the Wellness Center to the third floor has not been determined by facilities management.

Also on the horizon is the induction of a new cafeteria, projected to open in late spring. Akens said there is a possibility that the space it leaves behind will be divided into two separate entities: a student lounge and a large multi-purpose space. 

According to Saintable, when SGA heard about the building of a new food court last year they began taking student surveys on what students would like to see in that space. 

"Students have addressed through surveys that they would like to see more lounges where they can hang out," said Saintable. "Many students feel there is not enough space available for students to relax on campus."

Jones says the possible student lounge and multi-purpose space is only an idea right now being discussed amongst staff and faculty. 

"Students always want a place to read, watch television, or relax, A place for students to congregate is really to have students spend more time on campus. When students spend more time on campus they are more likely to participate in activities, to retain and meet their goals, and to meet other students." Jones said.

The food court space will be large enough to accommodate both needs in one space once the cafeteria moves to the first floor. The current space is 9,000 square feet - about the size of a major league baseball diamond.

 "We want to make the Biscayne Bay Campus a more inviting place," Jones said. "We're hoping that this new construction will help create more opportunities for students to come together, enjoy the campus and have [a] positive impact on the students."

Headline: Student Government election winners revealed
Author: Lucy Orozco / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Winners for Biscayne Bay Campus' Student Government Elections, held from Oct. 16-17, were announced on Oct. 18 at the Wolfe University's Panther Square. 

The positions to be filled included representatives at-large, lower division representatives, representatives of Journalism and Mass Communications, Housing Representative and Broward Pines Center representatives. 

Students had the opportunity to vote via Panthersoft.

In voting for each representative, only one student ran for each position. 

Katiana Saintable, president of BBC SGA, said that even if a student is running unopposed, it is their duty to campaign and let the student body know, that they are available to meet student concerns. 

"We want to do away with the attitude that says campaigning is unnecessary for running unopposed because candidates will win anyway," Saintable said. "It is important for these candidates to let the students know what their platforms are."  

Three representative at-large positions were available and three candidates ran: Yvette Casseide, Judene Tulloch and Alina Devitchinskaya. The lower division candidate was Krystal Omeir. 

Other candidates included Rashida Cohen for housing representative, Evonnia Dominguez for representative of journalism and mass communication and Summia Chaudhry for Broward Pines Center representative. 

Evonnia Dominguez, the new representative for the Department of Journalism and Mass Communications, is a 21-year-old junior majoring in Journalism. 

"Now, that I am in office," said Dominguez, "I plan to set up meetings concerning issues to enhance the school and the program."

Yvette Casseide, the second of the three representatives at-large, said that her busy schedule did not allow her to campaign. 

"I'm taking 18 credits this semester, and I'm working 32-40 hours outside of school," Casseide said. "Therefore, running unopposed was an advantage for me.

"Even though it is necessary to campaign, so the students can get to know me, my busy schedule did not allow me to campaign as much, and I did not have to loose my position."	

However, she said she will find other ways to make herself known.   

"I plan to get make my self visible as a representative in my classes, doing my satellite hours and through Facebook online," said Casseide. "My goals this year as a representative at-large are to make certain that the students' voices are heard. I will do my best to build a strong relationship involving students and SGA members. I will do my best to facilitate students in helping them do better academically by promoting helpful services that are available to them, such as the learning center, Multicultural Programs and Services (MPAS), Career Services, and Campus Life. I will also encourage students to get involved."

A salary of $1,100 a year is given to whoever fills these positions, according to Gabriel Labrador, SGA Elections Commissioner. The money for the salaries comes out of the activities and services fees that students pay each semester, according to the SGA budget reports. 

The representatives' purpose is to attend to the needs of the students involved with their particular constituency, representatives at-large adhering to the concerns of the entire student body. 

Representatives must also log five office hours a week and one satellite hour a week where they must walk around and introduce themselves to the students.  

To encourage voting, SGA held the elections in Academic One with boxes of Papa Johns Pizza, cookies and an assortment of drinks according to Labrador.

For the 2007 to 2008 academic school year, SGA was given $5,000 of student money to go towards the election budget. $500 of those dollars went towards this event.

Headline: Students still tan despite wrinkles, cancer risks
Author: Rocio Blanco Garcia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There are consequences for those who have a little too much fun in the sun. 

An increased risk of cancer and wrinkled skin are among the top worries that more than 28 million Americans who tan at the beach or use tanning beds face, according to The Skin Cancer Foundation. 

Protection against the sometimes harsh sun is essential for some, but Cristina Torras, a senior, said that even though she is aware of the potentially dangerous effects of tanning, she barely uses sun protection.

"My skin isn't that white, so I don't need to use that much protection," she said. 

Torras isn't alone in using little protection for the sun. Senior Patrick Aubone is a triathlete and often goes to the beach to train. 

He is aware that excessive sun exposure can cause skin cancer and sunspots but said that his skin still looks like it always has despite constantly tanning it.   

The effects of excessive sun exposure, however, might not be seen until melanomas - growths that range in color - start to appear on the body and the immune system becomes weaker, resulting in skin cancer. 

One million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States. 

Research has shown that in the past melanomas mostly affected people in their 50s and older, but now dermatologists have patients in their early 20s and younger with this type of cancer. 

Yeslyn Greson, an employee at Tan Solaire Body Spa in Miami, said that the side effects of tanning are the last thing her customers think about, adding that people come into her spa looking for a darker skin tone to make themselves feel more appealing to others. 

"Nowadays, tanning is a symbol of beauty," Greson said.

Greson also said that the UV rays emitted by tanning booths make people feel happier. Her customers claim to feel better about themselves after they receive their weekly session in the spa, and some of them have used tanning booths as a tool to fight seasonal affective disorder, also known as seasonal depression, which typically happens in the fall and is believed to be related to the amount of sunlight a person receives, according to health web site medicinenet.com.

"While before everyone wanted to have a light skin color, now everyone wants to be tanned," Greson said.  

Although skin cancer and sun spots are potential effects of staying out in the sun too long, proper precautions can reduce the risks. 

Greson mentioned the use of glasses to protect the eyes and lotion for protection from sunburn. 

She added, however, that regardless of how much protection one uses, there are no safe UV rays and people should not spend too much time tanning.

"Everything in excess is bad," she said. "Even those things which are supposed to be healthy can [harm] you when you use them without control."

Headline: IN the BIZ: Class watches music videos, hosts CD release party
Author: Kassandra Pool / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
It's 7:50 p.m. on a Tuesday night, and as students walk into a Green Library classroom, a music video plays loudly on two screens. 

This is how Professor Oswaldo Rossi begins his combined business of music class, MUM 4301 & MUM 5705, every day with the intentions of mentally stimulating and engaging his students for the lecture ahead. 

Rossi is the director of legal and business affairs for EMI Televisa Music, where he negotiates, structures and drafts agreements for the Spanish language division of Capitol Records. He began teaching three semesters ago at the University of Miami before moving to FIU in the Fall 2006. 

"I've lived vicariously through the artists and record company I represent, but when I'm in the classroom, I'm the artist," he said. "All eyes are on me - it's my stage. I enjoy it for that reason among others [and] I really enjoy helping the students who are motivated to learn about the music industry."

Throughout the semester the students engage in a project where the class acts as a mock record company and conducts all the tasks necessary to produce a multi-artist compilation album. 

The students scout talent, evaluate the artists for inclusion in the CD and compile the repertoire through a voting process that is determined by the class. 

"[Rossi] divides the class into different sections that will be in the real world record label, so in essence we are the record label in a class setting," said Erik Deluca, a graduate student. "He acts as our boss and we have to respond to him."

Graduate student Michelle Gonzalez added that the collaboration among students will play an important part in the project's future.

"I believe our mock record label will be a success by the fact that before the semester's over, we will have learned how to work effectively with each other," said Gonzalez said.

In addition to being artist and repertoire representatives, each student is assigned a different task that is crucial in the process of producing the album within the record company, such as marketing, press and publicity, compiling label copy, securing licenses and creating production-ready artwork. 

Once the album is complete and has been manufactured, the class will host a CD release party, which is scheduled for Nov. 30 at Flavour Night Club in Coconut Grove.  

Attending the event will be various music executives who Rossi works with on a daily basis. About 20 to 30 music industry executives have attended the past three CD release parties. Attendees have included representatives from each of the four major record companies and music publishing companies agents including William Morris Agency, producers from Estefan Enterprises, managers and lawyers.  

Another important component of the class is the various guest speakers Rossi integrates into his lectures. This semester some guest speakers have included Cyrus Bolooki, drummer for New Found Glory; Eric Mendelson, manager for Capitol Records recording artist MIMS and nine-time Grammy Award winning producer Sebastian Krys.

When Bolooki spoke to the class, he said that it is important to always know what is going on around you in the music industry. ? 

"We signed a contract in 1998 and for nine years we were bound by an agreement which we signed when we were 19-years-old," said Bolooki. "We learned our lesson about contracts; in particular, we learned that we needed to be informed about things." 

According to Rossi, anyone who is interested in working in the music industry should be prepared to "engage in unpaid internships, be fully committed and have tough skin."

Headline: Unusual beverages featured at cafe
Author: Elyse Coleman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Upon walking into Lollicup, customers are greeted by a modern d&eacute;cor. A blue carpeted platform houses two red and brown couches. 

A series of nearby shelves contain board games and stacks of magazines. 

A TV hanging next to the counter might be displaying music videos, movies or a rerun depending on the time of day. 

Located across from the 16th Street entrance of the University Park Campus, this coffee and tea shop has been using student discounts and exotic teas to attract customers since undergoing management changes earlier this year.

"We bought the franchise in March and re-opened [after renovation] in April," said Khabeer Mustapha, owner of the Miami Lollicup. "I feel like we've done a lot to try and get people's attention."

The first Lollicup opened in 2000 under the name Lollicup TeaZone in San Gabriel Valley, Calif. Today, Lollicup has franchised into more than 80 locations in more than 11 states; four of these locations are in Florida.

What separates Lollicup from other cafes is the variety of boba teas. Boba is a chewy black pearls made out of tapioca that are layered at the bottom of the beverage. Boba tea is Taiwanese in origin and has a number of aliases, including bubble tea and pearl tea.

"I first heard about it at a Japan Club meetings," said Tom Morris, a junior. "One of the members showed up drinking boba tea. I absolutely love the taro tea and wish my schedule allowed me more time to sit and enjoy the atmosphere instead of having to drink and run."

 The tea selection includes traditional flavors such as chocolate and strawberry as well as jasmine and lavender teas. 

According to Lollicup's Web site www.lollicup.com, drinks are served in "specially designed closed-sealed-to-go cups," designed to prevent spilling.

Mustapha is trying to expand the menu to include more international fare.

"We're going to start selling more Asian pastries," he said. "Cuban pastries haven't been selling too well since you can get them anywhere." 

The current top sellers are the boba and taro milk teas, strawberry banana slush and protein smoothies. Temporary holiday flavors are being released to coincide with the upcoming holiday season. 

Pumpkin chai for Halloween and plans for eggnog and peppermint flavors around Christmas are all planned to sell.

Some students such as Donovan Hobbs, however, are drawn to the location by the atmosphere. 

There is free wi-fi and Mustapha is pushing to have a series of personal computers set up for free use. 

"I had heard of [Lollicup] a year ago, but did not try it until I was some invited by some friends," said Hobbs, while playing Connect Four and drinking a milk tea. "I really like the almond and taro milk teas."

In addition to franchises, Lollicup also has an online store, www.lollicupstore.com, where consumers as well as franchise owners can buy ingredients and equipment for making menu items. 

The Web site also provides recipes and more information on the company.

Headline: Female student victim of sexual battery
Author: Ben F. Badger Jr. / Asst News Director
&nbsp;
A female FIU student was victim of a sexual assault crime last weekend in a South Beach hotel.

Gary Zerola, a former Boston, Mass., defense attorney, was arrested by Miami Beach police for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting a young female student Oct. 23. 

He has been charged with sexual battery.

According to a police report obtained by The Miami Herald, Zerola and his female companion Jheri Leigh Burch met the FIU student at club Mansion on 1235 Washington Ave. 

According to The Miami Herald, surveillance video shows Zerola entering the Catalina Hotel, 1756 Collins Ave, at 3:03 a.m. with both women. The police report states that Burch did not like the fact that Zerola brought another woman to the hotel room, leading her to leave the room and rent another in the same hotel.

According to the police report, Zerola held the victim's face in his hands and forced her to take an unknown amount of pills with an unknown liquid.

After the alleged sexual assault took place, the FIU student woke up naked and bloodied next to Zerola. She then called the police from her cellphone.  

"I never had sex with her," Zerola said spontaneously when Miami Beach police arrived, according to the report.

Zerola is already awaiting trial in Boston for two sexual assault charges. 

This latest incident has prompted Mass. prosecutors to request that Zerola's bail be revoked. 

"Traditionally, college-age students are at higher risk for sexual assault," said Sherry Aaron, director of FIU's Victim Advocacy Center. 

With 350 attempted and/or succeeded rapes per 10,000 college students per year and only 37 percent of those victimized actually reporting to the police, when prevention is too late, there are tips and procedures that can be followed to bring justice and peace to the criminals and victims, respectively.

"The most important thing after the fact is to get medical care," Aaron said. 

Those who wish to press charges against their attacker should also have a rape kit performed. 

It also important not eat, drink or bath if possible before the kit is performed. This is to preserve any biological evidence that may have been left behind by the attacker from being destroyed. 

Aaron also said it is vital to put any clothes a sexual assault victim was wearing into a paper bag to preserve biological evidence. Plastic bags can degrade the quality of the evidence. 

Time can also be a factor, as the State of Florida requires all physical evidence to be collected within 72 hours. 

Aaron said that while rape is never the fault of the victim, some dangerous situations could be avoided. 

Aaron commented that if you feel like you have been drugged, it is imperative you do not go to an isolated area with any one person, as it is possible this is the person who drugged you.

"Do not go outside or away from the group if you feel like you've been drugged," Aaron said. "Students should look out for other students."

 The VAC has a 24-hour hotline for anyone with questions or concerns about assault, sexual assault, battery or anything likewise in nature. In an emergency situation, however, calling 9-1-1 is the first number to dial,  Aaron said. 

"We are here to support students and help them recover," Aaron said.

Appointments can be made to speak with an advocate, but walk-ins are welcome. The center is open nights and weekends for emergency situations. 

If you have been or are a victim of sexual assault or related crimes, you can contact the VAC hotline at (305)348-3000.

The VAC is located in the University Health Services building suite 210 and open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the University Park campus. 

The VAC's Biscayne Bay Campus office is located at Academics Two, room number 246-C. 

Call 305-348-1215 for appointents.

Headline: Club brings Chinese culture to University
Author: Michael Dutter /Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Ni hao - Chinese for hello - is what members of the newly formed Chinese Club are hoping to say to potential club members. 

Founded for those interested in the culture and language of China, the club was established last summer and already reached 77 members, although the club is not the first to explore Chinese culture. 

The Asian Student Union, a club that promotes Asian culture at FIU, also explores aspects of China. 

But according to Natasha Fern&aacute;ndez, the Chinese club president, that was not enough. 

"We created the club because we needed to have an organization whose only emphasis was on the Chinese culture," Fern&aacute;ndez said. 

Fern&aacute;ndez became involved with the creation of the Chinese club after meeting her Chinese II professor, Audrey Qian. 

Qian felt the need to create a place outside of the classroom for students to learn and speak Chinese with other students and give them more exposure to the  Chinese culture. 

She pitched the idea to Fern&aacute;ndez who quickly began bringing the club to fruition.

Before she was done filling out the forms, she would meet her future co-president Antonia Simone during the first Chinese Speech Competition in Spring 2007.

Both students worked diligently on the paperwork required by the Student Organizations Council to form their club and, before they were done, decided to be the co-presidents for the Chinese Club.

Audrey Qian, has since left FIU but professor Ma Li, a Chinese instructor, has taken over as the club's first official advisor.

"I think the club is doing great," Ma Li said. "Everyone is very involved ... As long as I'm here, I will [give] the club my support."  

Dennis Aranzazu, the event coordinator of the club, has been actively setting up Chinese movie nights at least twice week as well as group meetings for those wanting to practice speaking Chinese. 

Though the language aspect of the club may seem daunting for those who are unfamiliar with it, they can take a sigh of relief.

"It doesn't matter if you don't speak Chinese, the club is open to all," Aranzazu said.  

For more information on the Chinese Club see www.fiu.edu/~soc or email them at fiuchinese@gmail.com.

Headline: Computer Science: Grant provides opportunities, funding
Author: Jessica Ariste / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
A recent $2.3 million grant awarded to FIU's Computer Science Department will allow students and faculty to participate in a worldwide effort to fix problems like health care, disaster mitigation and life sciences by improving technological communications.

FIU announced Oct. 15 the award by the National Science Foundation's Partnership for International Research and Education.

 Besides FIU, 19 other universities out of more than 500 proposals submitted received the award, which  will be paid over the next five years.

"This grant will have tremendous impact to the career development of our students," said Yi Deng, dean and professor at  FIU's Computer Science Department. 

The grant's main purpose is to solve the social problems faced today by improving the use of cyber-infrastructure.

Titled  "A Global Living Laboratory for Cyber-infrastructure Application Enablement," the grant will allow computer science students and faculty to participate in a worldwide effort to work with the leaders of research and development around the world and give them the opportunity to experience in first hand the global economy, Deng said. 

Cyber-infrastructure is a way to enhance research efficiency and remove existing barriers by using "very large networks and getting us ready for the next generation of computers to come," said Scott Graham, research coordinator of the School of Computing and Information.

One way in which improving cyber-infrastructure will enhance the quality of health care is by allowing doctors to communicate with each other and their patients faster and more easily than ever before, Deng said. 

This will improve health care because it will make it easier for doctors to distribute the latest information, share new solutions to health problems and much more.

South Florida's affinity for hurricanes is a major problem that the improvement of cyber-infrastructure will help alleviate. Currently, meteorologists give a statewide prediction of what will occur but more advanced information technology will allow for quicker, local forecasts. 

According to Deng, people want to know what is happening in their area as well as their property, but we can only achieve this by using all the computer resources available, and that is part of the research the grant will allow.

This grant will give FIU students the opportunity to work in IBM International Research Labs in countries like China, India, Japan, France and others, as well as working with different universities and technological institutes in Mexico, Argentina and Spain. 

"What makes this grant so unique is that it is designed to give students exposure in [information technology] and gives them the ability to further their careers internationally," said Steven Luis, director of IT business relations.

Students will have to meet certain requirements to be part of the project but the criteria are different for graduate and undergraduate students. 

Overall, graduate students must show how they can contribute to a research team and undergraduate students should have good communication skills and be top students, Luis said. 

Others involved in the project involve Florida Atlantic University and the Latin American Grid Consortium, co-founded by IBM and FIU. 

The NSF is a federal agency that provides about 20 percent of the funding given to colleges and universities throughout the United States to conduct scientific research.

"Generally the way it works is that you write a proposal describing what you want to do and how students will benefit and the proposal is viewed by a panel of experts and those who come in the top are the ones that are funded," said Masoud Milani, associate dean of the School of Computing and Information. "It's a very competitive process."

"It represents a wonderful opportunity to enhance FIU's connection to the international research, education and business community, and increase the University's visibility around the globe and to forge global partnerships in the critical areas of computer science and information technology," Deng said.

Headline: Razorbacks hand Golden Panthers 20th consecutive loss
Author: Chris Martinez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Saturday afternoon played out like many expected it to in Northwest Arkansas as the Razorbacks (5-3) ravaged Florida International University (0-8) 58-10. 

	The formidable duo of Heisman contender running backs Darren McFadden and Felix Jones contributed their part to the blowout, scoring five touchdowns between the two, often untouched.

	It was the Golden Panthers who ensured that they would have no opportunity to succeed in this game, however, setting the tone early by fumbling on the second play of their first possession after a completion which would result in a Razorback field goal.

	Following a three and out, Arkansas marched down the field, culminating in an 18-yard dash by Jones and McFadden running directly through two FIU defenders for the score, pushing the lead to 10 and initiating the rout.

	On the ensuing possession, Golden Panthers running back Julian Reams fumbled the ball inside the FIU 25 yard line, making it two turnovers in three drives and giving the game a similar feeling to the beat down in Happy Valley against the Nittany Lions. 

	Disaster was averted as cornerback Anthony Gaitor made a fine play in the end zone, intercepting the ball and giving FIU a chance at redemption.

	Six plays later, quarterback Wayne Younger took his turn at the turnover table, throwing a pick that would lead to another Razorback score and putting the deficit at 17.

	Another short drive followed, and the Golden Panthers' defense made one last gasp at keeping the game competitive by hitting Arkansas quarterback Casey Dick as he was throwing to a wide open Razorback receiver and knocking the pass awry. 

	An injury to Dick led to backup quarterback Nathan Emert taking the field, and after marching the offense down the field, finished off the drive with a handoff to McFadden, who by that point had established himself as far and away the best player on the field any time he was in the game.

	The Golden Panthers finally responded with some authority, as Younger took off for a 35-yard gain on the first play of the possession and finishing it off on fourth down with a beautiful pass on a streak down the side of the field to freshman wide receiver Greg Ellingson, who is developing some impressive chemistry with Wayne every game. 

	FIU got the ball back after a McFadden fumble, but promptly turned it over after another interception, leading to another touchdown for Arkansas.

	Leading to the end of the half, Younger drove down to the Razorback 18-yard line and put up a field goal, making the score 31-10 but being the last points FIU would score all game.

	Both teams effectively went through all the motions during the second half, with the Golden Panthers continuing to turn the ball over and Arkansas continuing to capitalize on it and put points up on the scoreboard.

	The statistics were by no means gaudy for Arkansas despite scoring 58 points. The Razorbacks were continually gift-wrapped the ball and presented with it often times in FIU territory, simply needing a few first downs to score.

	Despite throwing a school record five interceptions, quarterback Younger is the one position for the Golden Panthers that seems to be sewn up for the coming years. With the exception of one bad decision, all the picks came off of tipped balls that should have been caught and mistakes by the receivers. Younger also set an FIU record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a game, picking up 137.

	With the final out of conference game of the season over, the team has the opportunity to finish strong and give recruits and fans a reason to believe next season. While the team has certainly performed poorly, the ensuing schedule composes of winnable games and an opportunity to put this gut wrenching losing streak to an end.

Headline: Students abuse lax parking enforcement: Missing decals,  insufficient spaces create inconveniences for complying individuals
Author: Eric Feldman / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
All commuter students know how difficult it is to find parking, especially in the afternoon. If you go into any of the garages on campus, you will find cars parked outside of the stairwells waiting for a departing student.

It seems, though, that the problem is not just a lack of facilities that causes this headache, but also a lack of enforcement. After noticing that many cars parked in all four parking garages do not have decals, 28 vehicles counted on just one floor of the Panther Garage were out of compliance; this was in addition to cars that were parked in no-parking areas and cars with student decals parked in faculty and administration spaces.

Paula Cabrera, a sophomore majoring in math education said that she parked in the Blue and Gold garages for a whole year and never received a ticket until she parked in the Graham Center lot.

Cabrera said that she thinks the parking problems would be solved if the school "built a parking garage on all of the existing lots."

It is impossible to tell how many of the violators are students who simply do not wish to place the decal on their vehicle and how many are actually not supposed to be taking up the spaces but it is clear that the violations are unfair to compliant students.

"I have to make sure to arrive on campus 30 minutes before my class begins because it takes so long to find a spot," said Arlene Javier, a freshman majoring in occupational health. She also said that she notices many cars without decals while looking for a spot.

Another common occurrence is students who make extra spots out of the end of rows in the garages, where parking is not permitted.

Students are not the only ones who experience parking problems. The Beacon has published letters from faculty who are as equally  frustrated about headstrong student commuters who take up their spots.

Gordon E. Finley, a professor of psychology, told The Beacon that parking enforcement is "terrible to non-existent" specifically in the lots near student housing and the Public Safety building. Specific statistics on how many Parking and Transportation employees are assigned enforcement duties on a regular basis and how many tickets are given out weekly were not made available to The Beacon despite multiple attempts to reach 	Bill  Foster, the director of Parking and Transportation. Employees and supervisors for Parking and Transportation and supervisors were not allowed to comment on the issue.

The Parking and Transportation Web site, parking.fiu.edu, states that cars with student decals may park in spots with "plain white or unmarked bumper blocks" and that if a student is not driving a car with a decal, they must obtain a temporary parking permit.

It's not to say that finding parking at FIU isn't somewhat educational in itself. It's an exciting challenge that provides us with skills that we may find useful if ever stranded in the wilderness and having to stalk down prey for food. Unfortunately, when students are running late to class or an exam and we deserve better enforcement of parking rules to make our lives a little easier.

Finley offers some advice to officers on how to help find the students who are parked in faculty spots: "look for cars backed into spaces and decals with big words on them, like - student."

Headline: Recycling at FIU poorly executed
Author: Veronica Trueba / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
FIU calls itself an environmentally friendly University. Too bad the recycling bins that are supposed to be in all classroms and next to all vending machines are playing hide and seek.  Either that or they just aren't there.  

Freshman Beatrice Jourdain fails to notice them as well. "No, I  haven't really noticed them". 

It is really hard to blame her, since these bins aren't always particularly noticeable, or aren't there at all. Take for instance, one of the vending areas in Academic I at the Biscayne Bay Campus. There are two vending machines next to a big blue container that seems to contain recyclable material. But after closer examination, one notices that it is only a large bin containing a plethora of garbage, except for cans.

This is bit ironic since the FIU Web site on environmental responsibility, http://www.fiu.edu/~ehs/Env_Compl/Recycle.html, claims that bins are located by the vending areas and the loading zones.

 "We are going to increase paper collection including the amount of collection in classrooms and open areas such as hallways and lobbies," claims the 2006 Facilities Management Recycling Report.

When asked whether she had found paper collection bins in classrooms, senior Liv Carvalho answers, "No I have not. If I did, I'd use them." She is one of the many who either haven't noticed there are recycling bins in their classrooms or have discovered they don't exist at all.

But the most shocking fact is how FIU prides itself on recycling procedures that students don't even know about and thus can never contribute to. Out of several students that were questioned, not one seemed to know that the University recycles car batteries, oil, tires and oil rags.

The same is true when students were asked about the recycling of alkaline batteries, another service advertised by the Facilities Management Recycling Report. "No I don't use this service", claims sophomore Juan Prado. "I don't even know where I can go to recycle batteries."

The fact that these neat  recycling programs exist at FIU is completely useless if the University does not take the time to inform students.

So it seems that despite the fact that FIU's Environmental Responsibility Web site claims to have a significant amount of effective and diverse recycling programs, few of them appear to be carried out consistently. There are no recycling bins in all vending areas, paper collections systems seem to be invisible in many classrooms, and there are alternate recycling services that students wouldn't have guessed existed.

If it weren't enough, the 2006 Facilities Management Recycling Report announces some "immediate future plans," like the construction of recycling collection points at new buildings, most of which are supposed to be ready by now. But there is no way of knowing, since it's practically impossible to contact anyone that can provide information on FIU's recycling program.

The only contact information provided on the Environmental Responsibility Web site consists of two e-mail addresses. An e-mail of inquiry was written to both but as of right now they have yet to respond. 

When, the Department of Risk Management & Environmental Health & Safety, which is the closest link to the recycling Web site, was contacted they redirected the call to Custodial. Then Custodial forwarded the call to Diana Diaz Administrative Assistant of Facilties Operations. But after two calls and a message left in her line, there is still yet to be an answer.

So for students who are interested in improving FIU's recycling program and/or finding out which services it actually provides, a lot of patience and even some detective skills are advised, because they will  find themselves trapped in a beaurecratic labyrinth.

Headline: Letter to the Editor: Hispanic Heritage disregarded
Author: Melissa Fernandez / Junior / International Business Major
&nbsp;
Doesn't anyone wonder where Hispanic Heritage is this year? In the past we have had weeks of events designed to teach students about Hispanic culture as well as celebrate it. 

During this time, students, faculty, and staff all flock together and enjoy the events, regardless of their backgrounds. GC is buzzing with music and entertainment; students dance, laugh, learn and eat some of our Hispanic delicacies. But where are these events this year? Where are the decorations in GC proudly showcasing that it is time to celebrate Hispanic Heritage? 

It seems as though the FIU UP Campus has forgotten to adequately honor the largest student demographic on campus. 

FIU is 69 percent Hispanic. There have been a few little events here and there, which are barely advertised. They seem to be simply an afterthought. Hispanic Heritage has been proudly celebrated at FIU for many, many years. 

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15th to October 15th, but did anyone notice? It saddens me to see there is no unity or spirit with regard to Hispanic Heritage. Why is it that in 2007, with a bigger campus, a bigger Hispanic student population, and a bigger budget, we are reducing the value of celebrating this culture?

Headline: Volleyball: BACK ON TRACK...Team recovers from four-game losing streak with sweep
Author: Renaldo Smith / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
After a season-long, nine-game winning streak, the women's volleyball team was in a danger of extending a four-game losing skid, the team's longest in three years. 

Even with the dark side of the history books looming, the team looked nothing short of domiant in a pair of 3-0 wins over Sun  Belt Conference opponents Arkansas State (30-28, 30-25, 30-13) and Arkansas-Little Rock (30-23, 30-17, 30-25) Oct. 19 and 20, respectively,  at the Pharmed Arena. 

The reigning Sun Belt Conference Player of the Week, sophomore All-American Yarimar Rosa, was ecstatic about ending the losing streak.

"I am really proud of my team and this is the best feeling ever," Rosa said. "We stopped that losing rally and now we just have to keep winning."



FIU 3, ASU 0



The Golden Panthers were in disarray early against Arkansas State, as a series of service errors and miscommunications allowed the Lady Indians to open game one with a 10-3 lead. 

However, after a quick timeout, the Golden Panthers responded. Sophomore Olga Vergun led the charge with her aggressive net play and Rosa and the rest of the team followed suit. 

After fighting an up-hill battle throughout the set, the arena erupted when Rosa pounded a kill from the left side of the floor to tie the game at 28. 

Minutes later, the crowd got reason to get even louder as Rosa delivered a powerful kill past the fingertips of ASU's Christin Baker to secure set. For the rest of the match, the Golden Panthers were overwhelming. 

Despite the occasional strong spike from Robin Aaron and Mafo Joelle, the Lady Indians faded into obscurity as the game progressed. 

Rosa finished with eight digs and a match-high 21 kills and Vergun delivered a 16-kill, 10-dig performance. Senior setter Keila Oliveira led the offense with 41 assists in the win. No Lady Indian had double digit kills, with Aaron pounding a team-high seven. Joelle was one behind with six in the losing effort.



FIU 3, UALR 0



Against UALR, the Golden Panthers used the same formula from a day before to defeat the Trojans. Rosa had 21 kills on a strong .472 hitting percentage to lead the charge. 

Oliveira orchestrated the offense to the tune of a match-high 43 assists. Caught in a tight knit opening set, it took nine kills from Rosa and five from Vergun to pull away from the Trojans. 

In the second game, the Golden Panthers went on a 19-5 run sparked by freshman Ines Medved. 

With momentum on their side, the Golden Panthers put up the first eight points in the thrid and final set, digging a hole too deep to climb out of for the Trojans. 

Katie McCutheon and Amila Barakovic put up seven kills a piece for the Trojans in the loss. The win moved the Golden Panthers ahead of the Trojans in the SBC standings. 

The Golden Panthers will look to avenge early season losses to conference powerhouses Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee - both tied for the SBC East Division lead - with rematches Oct. 26 and 27, respectively, on the road. Both teams had their way with the Golden Panthers at Pharmed Arena and Rosa says its time to return the favor.

"I think that everybody is real excited because they beat us at home," Rosa said. "What they did to us we want to do them. Everybody is confident that we can beat them and I think that it will be easier to play there. We want to have fun and make them look bad in front of their fans."

Headline: Notebook: Golden Panthers face Heisman candidate McFadden
Author: Darren Collette / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Coming off its 19th consecutive loss dating back to last season, 0-7 FIU heads into Fayetvilla, Ark., Oct. 27 to face one of its strongest opponents yet - the Arkansas Razorbacks. 

The Golden Panthers were downed 28-14 against Louisiana-Monroe and, despite the loss, it was the closest game this season. FIU finally showed some strength in a road game, held the lead in the beginning and was within one possession of tying the score for most of the game. 

Freshman quarterback Wayne Younger was FIU's offensive stand-out with over 200 total yards. Cornerback Lionell Singleton was once again put in to return kicks after some fumble problems early in the season. 

Singleton gained 170 total return yards on five kickoff returns and one punt return. Wide receiver Jeremy Dickens had six catches for 87 yards, the most yards gained by a FIU receiver this season.

  Arkansas is 4-3 this season with all its losses coming to teams that have been ranked at some point this season. The Razorback are led by junior running back Darren McFadden, last years Heisman Trophy runner-up, who has rushed for 932 yards and seven touchdowns this season. 

McFadden will pose problems for the Golden Panthers run defense, which has allowed over 200 rushing yards per game. The team has also allowed 20 rushing touchdowns this season, good for last in the Sun Belt Conference. 

If the missed tackles that have plagued the Golden Panthers defense all season show up on against Arkansas, then McFadden will boost his campaign for this year's Heisman Trophy.

FIU will be up against the wall heading into Arkansas. However, it does give the Golden Panthers a chance to make a statement in their last non-conference game this season. Just keeping McFadden below 100 rushing yards would be an accomplishment in what looks to be another David vs. Goliath match-up. 

Following Arkansas, FIU will play four more games, all against Sun Belt Conference teams. FIU will once again travel to Arkansas Nov. 3 to take on 3-4 Arkansas State and then get one more bye week before starting a three-game home stand at the Orange Bowl to close out the season.

Men's Soccer:

The Golden Panthers fell to 2-9-2 and 2-3 in conference play against No. 6 ranked Southern Methodist University, losing 2-0 in Dallas.

In the 20th minute, junior goalkeeper Kyle Thomas bumped into the Mustang's Bruno Guarda. Following the brief collision, Guarda lightly tapped the ball in for the first score of the game.

Golden Panthers were not getting any opportunities to score. SMU limited FIU to a mere two shots on goal.

In the 59th minute, Thomas was relieved by junior goalkeeper Matias Wilson. He allowed a goal in the last minute of regulation to seal the victory for SMU.

Sophomore Juan Guerra, FIU's best offensive threat, finished with three shots to no avail. 



Women's Soccer



A goalless weekend led to a winless weekend for the FIU Golden Panthers. The team's offensive struggles continued on the road versus the Troy Trojans and the South Alabama Jaguars. The team's Sun Belt Conference record fell to 0-6-2 and 2-8-2 overall. The club has not won a game since Sept. 23.



TROY 2 FIU 0



The Golden Panthers fell early as they have in most of their losses this season. In the 29th minute, Troy's Cecil Martinec tacked on a goal thanks to teammate Evelyn Keith's assist. The Trojan defense held the Golden Panthers at bay for the entire game, leading to numerous spoiled scoring opportunities. They out-shot the Trojans 13-4 in the second half.

In addition, FIU missed a penalty kick and a four-yard shot that would've given the Golden Panthers two goals to work with.

Freshman Claudia Cardenas led FIU with four total shots and two shots on goal.



USA 1 FIU 0



Another wasted defensive effort by the Golden Panthers led to the team's eighth loss of the season. Goalkeeper Madeline Gannon tied her season-high with 10 saves.

The majority of the contest was a defensive struggle.  FIU's best chance came when junior Maria Gauldron escaped the defense and blasted a shot that hit off the goalpost.

Three minutes into overtime, the Jaguars' Sam Slover shot a corner kick headed by Carly Williams for the game-winning score.

FIU hosts Arkansas State Oct. 26 at University Park as the team's hopes of entering the conference tournament are slim.



Swimming and Diving

Junior Lindsey Juman won the 500 in 5:28.26 with freshmen Tabina Chuk (5:29.12) and Victoria Dorante (5:41.16).

The Golden Panthers return to competition Oct. 26 and 27 at the Houston Invitational.
