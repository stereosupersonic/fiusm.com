Headline: Pi Kappa Alpha sign stolen from house
Author: Jenni Mesa / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Pi Kappa Alpha member Danny Denis was checking his MySpace account on the evening of Feb. 19 when he saw a friend request from a profile titled "The Pike Sign," followed by an unhappy face.

He viewed the webpage, although he did not accept the request. The page was dedicated to a stolen sign from the Pike fraternity house.

"It would have been a bigger deal if it had our [Greeks] letters on it, but it didn't," Denis said, the Fundraising Chair and Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) delegate for Pike.  

The wooden sign was about three feet tall and spelled out the word "Pike" in the fraternity's colors of garnet and old gold.

"There were all of these pictures of the sign in someone else's shower, kitchen, bedroom…at first I thought it was at a dorm room, but the walls were painted so I knew it had to be someone's house," Denis said. 

Denis claims that the photo came with a caption. 

"It also said that I used to be on top of the Pike stairs but I've been kidnapped and taken away from my home," he said.

Denis then gathered his other Pike members in the house to come to his room and showed them the page.  After seeing the page, the students checked their MySpace accounts and found that they had all received friend requests from the sign as well. "We couldn't believe it…I just thought, 'Damn, they got us good,' Denis said.

"We know that being only the second fraternity to have a house on campus makes us a target for acts of immaturity, whether it be from other fraternity men or non-Greek members of the FIU community," said Kenny Gelok, vice president of external affairs for Pike.

If the sign displayed the Greek letters for Pi Kappa Alpha, this theft would have become much more personal for the Pike members. This is because every Greek organization's letters mean something different, and these meanings are usually learned after a sacred initiation pledging process, in which, only members are permitted to wear, write or possess the letters of an organization.  

Even though the sign did not display the fraternity's letters, some Pike members still took the theft seriously. One anonymous member filed a police report with Public Safety. He also e-mailed MySpace officials to inform them of the webpage.  

Within a few days the page was removed from the MySpace site. However, it is unknown whether MySpace officials or the makers of the page are responsible for taking it down. My Space has agreed to work with the police and Sgt Rick Torres is currently investigating the case. 

"It would be really easy for them to find who made the MySpace account and who stole our sign," Denis said. "But I doubt that [Myspace] will." 

However, in addition to legal implications, the guilty party can face many other consequences as well. For example, stealing violates FIU's Student Code of Standards as a theft under offenses. Someone stealing a private sign from the front of a home would classify under the "removal or use of the property or services of another person or of the University without prior or written consent or authorization."

"Our office does not investigate alleged incidents," said Karen Dlhosh, director of the Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution department. However, "once our office receives reports from Public safety we would review the information and determine whether or not to file charges in regard to our Student Code of Conduct," Dlhosh said.

If another fraternity is guilty of this crime, further consequences are in store from IFC, in conjunction with Campus Life and the Office of Student Conduct, who can facilitate a judicial hearing. Inter-fraternity discrepancies are strictly handled on a case by case basis, according to Bobby Borgmann, IFC President.  

However, a hearing has not yet been initiated because neither the president nor vice president of Pike has formally notified either Borgmann or the Campus Life department, which is necessary in order to proceed with the formal processes of a hearing.  Both Borgmann and Andrea Gaspardino, associate director of Campus Life said that they have heard about the incident from Pike through informal conversations. Eddy Suarez, vice president of internal affairs for Pike, said that he plans to properly notify them if another fraternity is charged by Public Safety.

"It is disappointing to know that items were stolen from one of this institution's fraternities and I hope that the sign is returned," Borgmann said.

Headline: Linton wants to accomplish unfinished goals
Author: Betsy Martinez & C. Joel Marino / Beacon Staff
&nbsp;
After serving as vice president and as president of the Biscayne Bay Campus Student Government Association, Lemar Linton has decided to run for president again in the upcoming elections taking place April 5 and 6. 

The Beacon recently interviewed Linton about his qualifications for the position, the future of BBC and his goals for the upcoming semesters. 

Q: What student leadership experience qualifies you to serve the students as a member of the SGA? 

Being in SGA for the past year has exposed me to several networking opportunities, which I believe give me the experience and contacts to effectively serve the students of the Biscayne Bay community. 

At FIU I have also served on several committees as a voting member alongside many of FIU's esteemed leaders. I have served, and currently serve, on such committees as the BBC Leadership Team headed by Vice Provost Moncarz, the University Fee Committee, Disaster Resistant University Advisory Committee, Commencement Committee and FIU's Board of Directors, just to name a few. 

Q: What makes you the best candidate for the job? 

I would never boast of being the best candidate for the job of President of SGA. What I would say is that I am extremely passionate about my University and my campus and I am here to serve the constituents that I represent at BBC. 

I know the concerns of BBC. I know what the students want and need and I have the vision, the dedication, the passion, the goals and the desire to see BBC students get their needs met. 

My primary reason for running for office again is that SGA has unfinished goals from this past administrative year and I don't want to leave SGA or FIU until I see these goals accomplished.

Q: What are some of your objectives for the coming year? 

My top goals are really a continuation of goals that I set last year during my term in office. I will continue to work very closely with the Vice Provost's office to bring more classes to [BBC]. 

I also went to Tallahassee recently to lobby for state dollars so that we can have more programs at BBC. 

I will work as hard as I can to ensure that fee increases and tuition increases are kept to an absolute minimum. 

One of the things I was able to do as current president is to meet with and lobby Gov. Jeb Bush to get him to decrease his 5 percent proposed tuition increase. 

I will continue to work with BBC's food service director to see an improvement in cafeteria services. SGA is a strong supporter of Aramark and in return we are challenging Aramark to support our community through improved service. 

I will continue to fight to have FIU involved in university-wide activities and issues. I have also worked to increase the visibility of the SGA at BBC by having SGA members, along with myself,  participate in community service around Miami. 

I [will] also conduct my weekly SGA meetings in different locations across campus and at the Pines Center to promote SGA and make it more visible.

Q: What areas of improvements will you be working towards? Are there any additions (such as special programs for students) that you plan on following? 

In all honesty, FIU does not lack in the area of programming and, with the approval of the medical school, we have everything here at FIU that we need. My main focus is to bring more of these programs, specifically to BBC, and improve on services University-wide. 

We still have a long way to go and this is what I will be working on. Building on my success of having these programs offered and getting more to be offered at BBC. 

We must continue to strengthen our student services and see improvement in the appearance of our buildings. This year, SGA has begun a beautification project and if I am elected, I will make sure that it continues.

Q: How do you plan on improving ties with University Park's SGA?

One of the things I would say is that [Alfie Leon] who would be the new president at UP is very supportive of BBC. We have worked together in the past and share common ideas for how we want to see FIU progress. Of course, we all have our own goals to enhance, but I believe that in the coming year we'll see some greater cooperation between the campuses 

Q: You mentioned how you've participated in past events to represent BBC. What type of work would you do outside the SGA office to further BBC's reach?

Any efforts that the university plans on doing, I'll attend. 

I don't think there has been appropriate representation of BBC, which is something I've worked in the past to fix and will continue to fix. 

For this coming year, I'll make sure BBC is included in whatever event FIU is trying to participate in. 

I've personally spoken to [Rosa Jones, vice president of student affairs] to include us in certain activities, and I believe my attempts were successful. 

Whether it be lobbying for money, going back to the Board of Governors - even though I don't think we'll be doing that again soon - or lobbying the State Legislature for funds, any activity that they're doing I'll be there.

FIU:
School of Medicine to be celebrated

The University will celebrate the approval of the School of Medicine March 30 at 1 p.m. in the Graham Center Pit at University Park. The approval took place March 23 in Tallahassee on a 15 to 1 decision.

University top 10 of entrepreneurial programs

Fortune Small Business magazine named FIU one of the top 10 "cool" universities for entrepreneurial programs and research. According to the magazine the University's Eugenio Pino and Family Global Entrepreneurship Center serves the largest minority population out of all higher education institutions in the country.

"South Florida's location and ties to Latin America make our center unique," said Interim Provost Ronald Berkman in a press release. "This allows our center to work with small and emerging businesses that have international links."

Aside from all theory classes, the program allows students to design small business plans for farmers in Central America. The center is one of eight Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation's centers in the nation and it conducts research such as the 2004 U.S. Entrepreneurial Assessment.



Student selected for scholars program



Charlilyn Gaviria was picked to participate in the Distinguished Scholars program, given by the National Society of Collegiate Scholars which consists of an internship in Washington, D.C. for eight weeks. 

This internship gives students the ability to work at a place that matches their career choice; for example, in past years students have worked at Knight-Ridder, U.S. Department of Commerce and the Smithsonian Institution. 

This program includes an evening class at Georgetown University called Contemporary City which will give students a chance to meet with community leaders, social entrepreneurs and learn about issues concerning AIDS, poverty and education. 

NSCS is the only interdisciplinary honors organization for first and second year college students in the nation, membership is by invitation only and is based on grade point average and class standing.

Headline: Empathy: The ultimate method of violence prevention
Author: Amy Sherman / KRT Campus
&nbsp;
It's one of the most basic human traits: We care about others.

Even newborns may have empathy: They react to the distress of their peers by joining in their cries. As we get older we feel angry with others at times, but our inhibitions stop most of us from lashing out violently. One psychologist says there's no such thing as a person who is completely devoid of empathy.

How then can we explain how three Florida teenagers allegedly beat three homeless men, killing one of them?

Psychologists say they can't speculate about the behavior of these particular teens.

But, in general, scientists know some factors do make it easier for people to act without empathy. Among them: Do the attackers see the victims as part of a lesser, different group? Are the attackers acting in a group rather than as individuals? Were they themselves victims of bullying or abuse? Were drugs involved? 

Every time the answer is yes, it gets easier for the attackers to overcome the basic inhibitions against hurting others.

The public will likely learn more about the lives of three defendants during court proceedings in the next several months. Billy Ammons and Brian Hooks, both 18, and Tom Daugherty, 17, have been charged with first-degree murder in the Jan. 12 beating. 

Norris Gaynor, who died from his injuries, was bludgeoned so severely _ his head swollen to three times its normal size _ that his father could not recognize him. A surveillance video that aired nationwide showed two of the teens repeatedly swinging baseball bats at the head of a man curled up the ground in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Psychologists generally define empathy as the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes. 

It's easy for people to lack empathy for those they perceive as unlike themselves. 

"Members of the KKK have concern for others, it's just their concern for others is limited to others whom they perceive as like themselves," said Gene Cash, a school psychologist at Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Fla.

It's not surprising to psychologists that the teenagers would prey on the homeless, just as some serial killers have preyed on prostitutes.

"You can convince yourself these people don't matter," said N.G. Berrill, a New York forensic psychologist and expert on violent behavior. "They are not attached to anything. It's like shooting rats in a junkyard."

Race may have also allowed the teenagers to view the homeless men as different from themselves.

The teenagers, who traveled to the scene of their violent spree in an SUV, are white and middle class. Their homeless victims were black, Haitian and Dominican.

"I can tell you unequivocally it's entirely possible they have empathy for people like themselves and lack empathy for people unlike themselves," Cash said.

Adolescent males are particularly prone to group behavior, where they egg each other on to be daring and aggressive, said Berrill. 

Acting in a group, teenagers might act in ways they wouldn't as individuals. 

"They feel their personal identity is so tied to the group it would be disastrous to them at a psychological level" to not follow the will of the group, Cash said.

Adults are also susceptible to group behavior. For example, Cash says, the American guards at Abu Ghraib in Iraq never would have abused the Iraqi prisoners if they were acting alone.

But psychologists say teenagers who are leading healthy, happy lives and are connected to school wouldn't lash out violently. Committing acts of unprovoked violence is strongly correlated with being a victim of violence or bullying.

Children who bully often come from homes where they learn aggression is the way to get what they want, said Joan Cole Duffell, director of partnership development at the Committee for Children in Seattle.

Using baseball bats "suggests a level of rage that ordinarily comes directly from being exposed to violence oneself," Cash said.

And drugs and alcohol could have lowered their inhibitions. The teenagers were known to smoke pot, drink alcohol and take Xanax, classmates and neighbors said.

If perceiving some people as inferiors prevents empathy, getting them to see the homeless as real people can promote it. Face-to-face interaction is particularly important in an area where many teenagers live in gated communities and have little contact with those who aren't middle or upper class.

Gaynor's death has prompted schools and groups to organize programs to teach students empathy for the homeless. Officials in Florida are talking about creating a speakers' bureau to bring current and formerly homeless people into schools.

At least one school in Broward County already offers students a chance to meet those less fortunate than themselves. At Archbishop Edward McCarthy High School in Southwest Ranches, Fla., teenagers learn empathy by meeting people living with AIDS, migrant workers and the homeless. 

"Yes, they know there are poor people, but they most likely never had a firsthand encounter with them," said Frank Castillo, theology department chair.

After Gaynor's slaying, students distributed blankets and socks to the homeless.

"It was `I'm worried about David. I'm worried about Sandra.' They are real homeless people with names," Castillo said. "The fact that they want to do it again tells me they have a genuine concern."

Laurie Devaney, an Archbishop McCarthy senior, said she was surprised that the homeless were generous, though they had little. They limited how many supplies they took and left some for others. 

"They were considerate of other people," she said. 

Devaney said the experience opened her eyes to the lives of homeless people.

"I was able to see they're really not that different from most people," Devaney said. "They're just like us, except less fortunate. They are still people; they have goals and dreams. They just don't have a lot of materials."

Headline: Chinese restaurant offers flavorful cuisines, variety of dim sum delicacies
Author: Lalinda De La Fuente / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
It's no wonder Tropical Chinese was named most popular Chinese restaurant in Miami by the Zagat Survey in 2005. The combination of their authentic dishes and delectable dim sum make this inconspicuous locale not only a beloved Miami culinary institution but a place to frequent when you want flavorful Chinese cooking.

Tropical Chinese may sit hidden in a Westchester strip mall but their food is anything but ordinary. For those familiar with the Chinese tradition of dim sum, it's easy to understand how one can become hooked on the bite-sized fare. 

What is traditionally meant to be a light meal eaten anywhere from the late morning to lunchtime can easily transform itself into a complete chow down enjoyed at any time of the day.

The high traffic times at this Chinese favorite are generally between 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. During these times one can expect to wait for a table for as long as a half-hour.  Usually, the wait time is shorter.  Once inside, you can enjoy your meal among a variety of Chinese décor and large paper lanterns. Via a viewing window, patrons may also observe the cooks at work in their kitchen diligently turning out hot batches of their cornerstone: dim sum.

Dim sum is not merely bite-sized foods from dumplings to desserts. Half of dim sum's charm stems from the practice of bringing it to you via special carts. Few foods can boast that they come to you the minute you take a seat. The constant flow of food being brought to your side serves for an interesting experience coupled with the tendency to overindulge.

Now that you're seated and the food is continually being brought to you, the question is: which dishes are the right ones for me? Dim sum offers a variety of different meats from chicken to pork to beef and all the seafood in between. Other dishes are purely vegetarian making this restaurant universally customer friendly. Dim sum can also be prepared steamed, fried or sauteed.

The correlation between every dim sum house in the country is the variety of dumplings they offer. Tropical Chinese's dumplings present flavorful stuffing prepared either steamed to fried. 

Their shumai are a universal favorite among dim sum patrons. These petite steamed dumplings are stuffed with a moist pork or shrimp filling and are enveloped in a thin, soft shell.

The baked and steamed barbecue pork buns are also a must-try at Tropical. These buns consist of pork barbequed in a sweet sauce and stuffed inside a soft, doughy, steamed bun or a sweet, bread-like, baked one.

For those who thrive on trying one-of-a-kind dishes, Tropical Chinese serves a delicious sliced octopus. This simple dish offers moist, fresh and savory meat. Their shrimp stuffed mushrooms are a treat for any mushroom lover. They are served in a gravy-style sauce that serves to accentuate the flavor of the shrimp and mushroom combination.

Dim sum does not stop feeding you after your main course. The fare extends straight to dessert.  Their egg custards present a sweet and creamy custard nestled inside a flaky crust. Another must try is their sesame balls. These ooey-gooey balls are coated in sesame seeds and contain a sweet, rich red bean center. These are a perfect way to end your dim sum experience.

These dishes, unlike the dim sum, aren't what makes Tropical Chinese a must-try in Asian cuisine;  nonetheless, they are still authentic tasting and flavorful dishes for those who long for some basic Chinese dishes. 

Tropical is the perfect place to fall into some quality Chinese fare at prices that won't break the bank.

Headline: Program provides opportunity to aid community youth
Author: Laura Catherine Jokisch / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
"Big Brothers Big Sisters is a beautiful program," said sophomore Tania Babienko, a student active in the University's school-based program. "Sadly, there are not enough volunteers. My little brother was enrolled for a big [brother] when he was in Kindergarten, and he didn't get anyone until the end of second grade."

In its annual survey of 200 large charities, Forbes Magazine selected Big Brothers Big Sisters as one of its top 10. The magazine rated non-profits in three categories: charitable commitment, fundraising efficiency and donor dependency. 

Based on the considered criteria, BBBS made the publication's gold star list of charities worthy of donor consideration.

In 1997, retired General and Secretary of State Colin Powell founded America's Promise with the goals of providing caring mentors, safe environments, and effective education to improve the wellbeing of the next generation - as well as an opportunity to enrich the lives of young volunteers through community service. Today, the resulting Alliance for Youth is supported by business, education and government leaders and organizations along with hundreds of communities across the nation. 

The lead agency in Miami-Dade County for America's Promise is BBBS, a nonprofit organization that matches 'Littles,' at-risk children ages five to 16, with "Bigs," volunteers who provide support, friendship and guidance through casual one-on-one interaction.

"[It involves] just picking them up and hanging out at home or inviting them to family gatherings," said Deborah Calderon, president of the University chapter. "You meet with them after school, talk to them, play with them, help them with their homework, things of that sort. It means a lot to the kids just to know someone is making time for them."

Free events such as trips to museums or bowling alleys are organized for the community-based program, but the majority of involved FIU students are enrolled in the school-based program. Transportation provided by the University shuttles Big Brothers and Sisters to their Littles' school, where they help with homework or eat lunch together two or three times a week. 

"Usually, only 10 people show up for our events. Most students prefer the school-based program because they earn community service hours - but we're working on it," said Calderon, who has been paired with a Little Brother due to a lack of male student involvement. 

BBBS also has impressive statistics to back up its efforts. According to Public/Private Ventures, Little Brothers and Sisters are half as likely to begin using illegal drugs or skipping class than children without mentors. Studies also found increased confidence in school performance and greater ease in family relationships. 

"I'm so grateful for the Big Brother in my kid's life," said one parent according to the testimonial section of wementor.org. "Since Courtney has been in my son's life, I've seen so many changes in him. Oh ... the excitement in my son's eyes when Courtney comes to pick him up. I'm so overwhelmed."

And in the words of its volunteers, the benefit is mutual. 

"We are given a chance to make a difference in a child's life," Calderon said. "We are given a chance to make a new friend."

"I'm partially responsible for helping my Little to develop his full potential," Babienko said. "That is a nice feeling. It makes a person feel good; to do something you are not obligated to do, but bring a smile to a child's face … I really love the program."

In short, BBBS is both professional and personal, offering flexibility, varying levels of commitment to its volunteers and a valuable opportunity to make a difference and a friend.

Subheadline: Forget rides and shows, the Fair is all about the food
Author: Geoffrey Anderson Jr. / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The Miami-Dade County Youth Fair and Exposition has returned to Tamiami Park and provided a welcoming diversion for FIU students. While many people are attending the fair to ride the attractions or win prizes at the carnival games, others are going just for the assortment of available food. 

With nearly 200 food booths located throughout the fair, patrons can find all sorts of items to satisfy their hunger. Here are some of the more popular foods bought at the fair every year:



Elephant Ear

$4.00



For freshman Kevin Toovey, elephant ears are the only reason for attending the fair.

"Every year I go to the fair and get myself some elephant ears," Toovey said. "I can't find elephant ears anywhere else, so I have to go to the fair to get some of them. Even though they might be expensive, all my regrets fade after taking a bite." 

The pastry is a fried dough that resembles an elephant's ear. The food gets its irregular shape as a result of the frying process. At the fair, elephant ears are available with a variety of toppings such as powdered sugar and chocolate syrup. Funnel cakes, a variation of the elephant ear, are also sold at the fair. Unlike an elephant ear, a funnel cake gets its shape from being poured through a funnel. 

Bloomin' Onion

$6.00



Another popular snack among fairgoers is the bloomin' onion. Cut to look like a flower in bloom, the bloomin' onion is deep fried and has a crispy exterior. 

Sophomore Johnny Garcia thinks the bloomin' onion is a great deal for anyone attending the fair.

"The blooming onion is a great snack for a group of people," Garcia said.  "It's really big and has the appearance of a flower so it looks really cool. The dipping sauce in the middle makes it look even cooler. For six bucks, it's a steal compared to all the other expensive food at the fair." 



Corn on the Cob

$2.50 



Although commonly found outside of the fair, corn on the cob is an essential food choice for some attendees. Some students consider it a healthy alternative to other food available on the fairgrounds.

"The fair is filled with tons of unhealthy food like elephant ears and sundaes," said sophomore Edith Lacuyo. "It's hard to find something healthy there, so I always go for the corn on the cob. Compared to the other stuff sold at the fair, I think it's one of the healthier options." 

Other attendees love the corn on the cob because of its size. Fairgoers get a reasonably large cob with flag leaves, and they can add all sorts of flavoring to it.

"The corn on the cob is absolutely delicious," said junior Christina Santa Cruz. "It's pretty big and tastes awesome if you put salt and pepper on it. Corn on a cob beats corn in a can any day."



Corn Dog

$3.00-$5.00



Aside from treats like elephant ears and corn on the cob, corn dogs are a favorite delight for several fairgoers. This year, foot-long corn dogs are selling for five dollars to hungry visitors. Patrons can eat the corn dogs plain or add condiments such as relish and mayonnaise for flavoring. 

"The best corn dogs ever [are] from the fair," said senior Dalgys Eftrabao. "It brings back memories from my childhood with my grandfather."

The Fair will take place through April 2. Adult tickets are $8.

Headline: Baseball takes two of three at ASU
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
Redshirt junior Bryan Pullin had his hitting streak come to an end as the baseball team took two out of three games from Sun Belt Conference foes Arkansas State March 24-26 in Jonesboro, Ark.

Pullin, who recorded hits in the first two games of the series, failed to record a hit in the series finale. Pullin's streak ends at 34 games, one hit shy of the 17-year old school record held by Anthony Hicks.

"It would have been cool to get," Pullin said, "but it's not something I was striving for. I was just trying to have good at bats, hit the ball and help the team win."

The Golden Panthers raised their record to 20-10 (2-1 SBC) in their first series of conference play in 2006. Arkansas State stands at 13-12 (1-2 SBC).

FIU continues conference play March 31- April 2 with a three-game home stand against New Orleans.



FIU 8, ASU 4



Two homeruns in the seventh innings led FIU to victory in its first game of conference play. 

Following a three-run homerun by junior Cody Jacobs, which tied the game, Pullin hit his first homerun of the season to give FIU a 5-4 lead it would never relinquish.

FIU starter Walker Whitley pitched a complete game, allowed four runs (three earned), struck out 11 batters and walked no one.

Outfielders Chris Dunn and James McOwen each recorded two hits to lead FIU's eight-hit attack. Third baseman Nick Cadena recorded two RBI.

After ASU scored a run in the bottom of first inning, FIU answered back with a run of its own the very next inning. Dunn hit a fly ball to right field that was misplayed, allowing Cadena to score from second.

A three-run homerun in the fifth gave the Indians a 4-1 lead until the aforementioned seventh inning in which FIU scored four runs and took the lead for good.

"[My team] helped me out," Whitley said. "I got us behind a little bit and Cody and Pullin were able to step up and put a couple of runs on the board."

FIU added three more runs in the top of the ninth.



FIU 11, ASU 6



Nine Golden Panthers contributed to the 12-hit attack - three coming off the bat of Pullin, who went 3-for-6 with a homerun, two RBI and a run scored. 

Reliever Frank Gonzalez earned the win in relief of starter Kyle Preshong - both of whom pitched four and one-third innings.

Gonzalez allowed two runs, struck out five batters and walked two. Preshong allowed four runs (three earned), struck out two and walked three.

Corey Lozano and Luis Bautista recorded two RBI each. Cadena went 2-for-5 with a run scored.

Pullin started the game with a solo homerun and added two more runs in the second inning to take a 3-0 lead.

FIU made the score 4-0 in the fifth inning off back-to-back doubles from Pullin and Michael Lopez, but the Indians tied the game in the bottom half of the inning with four runs of their own.

The very next inning, FIU took the lead again, scoring four runs on three hits and two ASU errors - highlight by a bases loaded walk to Luis Bautista to make the score 8-4.

The closest ASU got was 8-6 after a solo homerun in the eighth, but left two men on base to end the Indian's threat.

 FIU scored three insurance runs in the top of a ninth inning.

Eric Horstmann pitched the final one-third inning of the game.



ASU 7, FIU 4



Pullin's streak came to an end on the same day Arkansas State thwarted FIU's attempt at a sweep.

ASU shortstop Brett Kinning, who was selected as the pre-season Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year, hit two home runs to lead his team to victory.

FIU starter Chris Siebenaler went six two-third innings in a losing cause. Siebenaler drops to 1-4 on the season as he allowed five hits and five runs.

Freshman Alex Alfonso, Lopez and Lozano recorded two hits a piece and Cadena added two RBI to lead the Golden Panthers offensively.

FIU took a brief 4-3 lead after scoring two runs in the fifth and sixth inning, respectively, highlighted by an RBI single from Alfonso that scored James McOwen, who advanced to third on an errant pickoff attempt.

ASU took the lead for good the very next inning, scoring two runs.

The Golden Panthers put the tying run on second base with one out in the eighth; however, the Indians got out of the jam with a strike out and a pop out.

ORLANDO, Fla. _ Money has always been plentiful for NFL owners. 

But the kind of money that was being talked about this month at an airport hotel outside Dallas had a lot of wealthy men (and two women) in sour moods. 

Behind the desk at his Alltel Stadium office last week, Jacksonville Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver described those meetings as "very cordial." 

He had trouble keeping a straight face. 

"Well, OK, maybe not cordial," Weaver corrected, with a smile. "How `bout we say they were civil." 

Good word. That would be "civil" as in "civil war."

That's pretty much what the negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players association came down to. The biggest sticking point in the talks wasn't between the league and its union, but rather a battle over revenue sharing between large- and small-market owners.

Ultimately, the two sides found common ground and avoided the kind of events that would have threatened an unprecedented run of prosperity and parity for the nation's No.  1 sport. 

"You've got 32 (owners) who are very professional," Weaver said. "We all have our own agendas. We are an eclectic group of people. We are all businessmen.

"But we also understand that in any business negotiations, there's got to be give and take. It just came down to us saying, `OK, let's get this deal done, shake hands and go home.'''

By agreeing to the union's proposal for a six-year CBA extension by a 30-2 vote, league owners bridged their chasm and assured what will be nearly a quarter-century of labor peace (at least) by the time the agreement expires after the 2011 season. 

"There is still a chasm and always will be a chasm, which is why the owners are to be commended," said Atlanta Falcons President/General Manager Rich McKay, who co-chairs the league's competition committee. "There is a common understanding in that fraternity to do what's in the best interest of the game, and ultimately that's what their decisions and votes come down to. It's no different than it ever was.

"There are always going to be differences, whether it's with television or shared or unshared revenues. This time probably was more visible than ever before; it also dealt with much, much more money than ever before."



COMMISSIONER SEARCH



Now with that mega-roadblock behind them, NFL owners arrived in town on Sunday for four days of meetings at the Hyatt Grand Cypress that will focus on less-combative - albeit crucial    issues. The hot-button item of the week will be launching the search to find a successor to Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who last week announced his resignation effective in July.

Though each owner will have a thought on the subject, it's not expected to be nearly as contentious _ correction: civil - as the CBA negotiations that placed several owners on polar opposite sides.

Weaver and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, for example, were said to be among the most vocal for the small and large markets, respectively. 

Jones made no secret of his displeasure with the deal when it was finalized March 8 as the third and final deadline for an extension loomed.

"I don't want to look disingenuous, but more than the money, I believe the structure we had in place has really contributed a lot to the success that we've had in the NFL," Jones told reporters. 

"It has brought capital into the NFL, it has built stadiums in the NFL. To move away from that was my biggest concern, fixing something that in my mind wasn't as broke as maybe others might try and want it to be. I had to get past my skepticism."

He apparently has done so, meaning there won't be any awkward moments in the Hyatt elevators this week. 

"Jerry and I are talking," Weaver said. "We're fine."

Chances are, none of the owners would have characterized the negotiations three weeks ago that way. Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson and Cincinnati President Mike Brown voted against the final proposal. 

"I would say nobody walked out of that room thrilled with the final resolution," Tampa Bay Executive Vice President Joel Glazer said. "And I would also say that would suggest we did the right thing."

Jones was among a handful of owners (nine of them, reportedly) from teams in large markets that generate substantially more money compared with the rest of the league. Those owners balked at proposals to require the highest revenue-generating clubs to donate chunks of their money to a pool that would help subsidize costs for teams at the other end of the revenue spectrum.

"The term that's thrown around is `revenue-sharing,''' Weaver said. "I call it `cost-sharing.'''



CHANGES IN SHARING



Since the original CBA was crafted in 1993, teams have contributed equally to a pool that funds player salaries and benefits based on across-the-board league revenue. During the course of those 12 years _ with the growth of the league and addition of 16 new stadiums _ local revenues in bigger markets have swelled disproportionately, thus driving up costs for the smaller-market clubs. 

Whereas the Cowboys might have to contribute 40 percent of their revenues to the kitty in a given season, the Bengals' share might have been closer to 70 percent. 

The large-market owners wanted their smaller brothers to get more creative with revenue streams. The small argued their opportunities were limited compared to their counterparts.

The stalemate had do be broken. If not, the 2006 season was poised to be the last under the salary-cap system, with the `07 season _ the last of the CBA deal _ rolling to an uncapped year and threatening to turn the NFL into a class system of haves and have-nots, like baseball. 

So a model was proposed. It called for the top 15 revenue-producing teams to contribute weighted amounts _ in the millions, of course - depending where they ranked on the scale. The same 15 teams also would be asked to forfeit the money from digital media and Internet services. 

Finally, $30 million more would be kicked into the kitty, making for an annual subsidization of around $120 million for smaller market clubs during the course of the six-year extension. 

Jones irritated some owners by referring to the plan as "welfare," but this was more about well-being. 

The NFL, from the time it was founded in a Canton, Ohio, car dealership 86 years ago, always has been based on the sharing of money to make the entire league strong. But this wasn't outside income from gargantuan TV contracts that could be spread evenly about. These were pure profits being handed over.

Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, to name one, was being asked to dip into the immense revenue generated by corporate sponsorships for the richest franchise in American sports and luxury boxes from the league's biggest stadium in order to help Buffalo's Wilson subsidize his costs in the new CBA. 

Just because.



ALL FOR ONE



The mere concept of giving away profits rubs against every rule that made these people millionaires (in some cases billionaires) in the first place.

But so does the concept the NFL was founded on.

Just ask baseball, basketball and hockey, each of which has fallen prey to ugly labor unrest during the 18 years the NFL has enjoyed labor peace. 

Glazer sat next to his father, Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer, and knew exactly where all the rhetoric was headed. 

"Anyone who enters the league knows its history," said Glazer, who confirmed the Bucs will be one of the contributing teams.

"That history is enforced to the point where it becomes a sense of responsibility that each owner has as a caretaker of a franchise. When you're sitting there, talking about these issues, you know in the back of your mind _ it's ringing in your head _ that we're going to do the right thing. 

"As they say, for the good of the league."

NFL owners proved once again that their pledge to the game they control is as good as their word. 

"The one thing people understand about the NFL, and the one thing that has made us great, is that the sum of the total is worth more than all the parts," Weaver said. 

"We need the Redskins, but the Redskins need us, just like they need Dallas, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Green Bay. That's what the league was based on for a long, long time. And we embrace that."

Headline: Republicans should distance themselves from Bush policies
Author: Alex Cumana / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
With the midterm elections eight months away, Republicans in both houses are breaking away from President George Bush's agenda in order to save their own political lives. The GOP has split between those who are against his policies and others who have remained loyal on most of his issues. With so much turmoil heading into the election, such as the Jack Abramoff scandal, the Republicans stand to lose control of the Senate and possibly the House of Representatives.

The Bush administration is facing doubts over issues ranging from immigration to foreign policy. The latest clash stems from ongoing concern over the war in Iraq. Republicans who call themselves 'realists,' like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, claim the administration miscalculated their efforts in Iraq, while neoconservatives remain convinced that it will be a catalyst for democracy.

One cannot be surprised to see senators such as Chuck Hagel question the war front. Three years ago, Bush insisted that going to Iraq was a measure of national security and that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. After finally realizing that Iraq had abandoned its nuclear weapons program, the administration switched to claiming that the war was fought for Iraqi freedom and human rights. 

The irony is that Bush originally claimed that Bill Clinton's efforts for democracy in Kosovo and Somalia were idealistic; six years later, he is trapped in his own words. This leaves congressional Republicans, who originally supported the idea of strengthening national security, questioning whether they want to stand behind a man who is voicing Clinton-like ideals about rights and freedom.

Republicans have taken it to Bush on the Senate floor as well, some aligning with Senate Democrats on accusing the president of violating the Constitution by wire tapping without a warrant. This shouldn't come as a shock; Bush again goes outside of traditional party ideals of small government and individual freedom by tapping into people's records and personal lives.

The United Arab Emirates ports deal faced strict opposition from both parties in Congress. Republicans, wary of low presidential and congressional approval ratings, once again countered Bush's wishes by not giving the UAE, home of known terrorists, control of six ports. Bush, who had rallied his base around an agenda of strong defense and U.S. military might, broke from the GOP by almost giving six major ports to a nation that has repeatedly harbored terrorists.

His immigration policy, or lack thereof, has Republicans balking at his plans. House and Senate GOP members are calling for tougher security measures, supporting a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. 

The administration's flimsy resident-work plan has not received any support from his base, further pushing them away from him.

Bush's policies are all over the place. He has abandoned his 2000 campaign promises of small government, compassionate conservatism and a non-interventionist foreign policy. His fiscal irresponsibility and his Clintonesque calls for democracy have House and Senate Republicans shying away from him to save their own careers. 

This is not new for the president, however. Congress blocked a Social Security reform and a bi-partisan group halted an effort to end filibusters on judicial nominations. Bush is looking more like a lame duck president as each day goes by. 

With the elections coming up soon and GOP approval ratings sinking, House and Senate Republicans have to distance themselves from Bush if they have any hopes of holding on to the majority.

Headline: U.N., others fail to act as thousands die
Author: Hary Toledo / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
There is a tragedy occuring in the Darfur region that has gone on for nearly three years. 

In 1948, the United Nations drafted an international definition of genocide in the hopes of preventing another Holocaust. 

The convention determined that "genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, as a whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

If the United Nations declares a group guilty of genocide, member countries are bound to act. Strangely enough, however, in February 2005, the United Nations reported that the Khartoum were not guilty of committing genocide. They instead found that crimes against humanity and war crimes were taking place in Darfur. 

This was a political decision, seeing as now none of the members want to intervene since, they have their own interests to worry about. 

According to an ever-increasing number in the CIA world fact book, the genocide in Darfur has as of yet claimed 400,000 lives and displaced over 2.5 million people. More than 100 people continue to die each day and 5,000 die every month. 

As if that was not bad enough, 180,000 have died because of illness and malnutrition. Darfur is not a mere humanitarian disaster that access by international relief agencies could reverse. 

The motivation behind the atrocities, committed by government-supported Arab militias, is the racist, fundamentalist and undemocratic Sudanese state. 

What is required for peace in Sudan is either a regime change, in which a democratic, inclusive state would be born, or a partition, in which the black African south and west would become an independent sovereign state, free of Khartoum and the Arab north. 

The conflict in Darfur is not a battle between uniformed combatants, and it knows no rules of war. Women and children bear the greatest burden. The Internally Displaced Persons camps are filled with families that have lost their fathers. 

Every day, women are sent outside the IDP camps to seek firewood and water, despite the constant risk of rape at the hands of the Janjaweed, one of the militant tribes commissioned by the government to execute the ethnic cleansing and, should men be available to venture out of the camps, they too risk castration and murder. 

Families decide that rape is the lesser evil; it's a crime that families even have to make such a choice. Often women are sexually assaulted within the supposed safety of the IDP camps, which shows that, in reality, nowhere is safe. 

Everyday evidence of killings that include men castrated and left to bleed to death, huts set on fire with people locked inside, children with their faces smashed in, men with their ears cut off and eyes plucked out and the corpses of people who had been executed with gunshots to the head continues to appear.

This is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, crises on the planet today and to not report these atrocities is a crime in itself. If morals and ethics do not compel them to act, remind them that elections are just around the corner.
