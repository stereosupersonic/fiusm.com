Headline: Transfer makes immediate impact
Author: Sergio Bonilla / Sports Editor
&nbsp;
It's not everyday a conference record holder falls onto your team's lap, but that's almost exactly what happened to the swimming and diving team over the summer.

After Louisiana-Monroe, a fellow Sun Belt Conference member, dropped their swimming and diving program, junior Zita Zalai was looking for a new school.

"She's a very good student, first of all," said FIU's head swimming coach Noemi Lung-Zaharia. "She has a very high GPA, so that's a thing we look for in [an athlete] even before recruiting her."

It also helps that she was the two-time defending Sun Belt Conference Champion in the 100-meter butterfly and set the conference record in that event her freshman year with a time of 56.33.

"Obviously, she's a huge add-on to have and [she's] going to definitely make our team better," Lung-Zaharia said. "That's why we recruited her."

Zalai cites many reasons for coming to FIU. A big bargaining point was that her and coach Lung-Zaharia are from Hungary.

"[FIU] is also a larger team then most other teams. This [swim team] now has 20 people on the team," Zalai said. "And it's Miami."

Zalai added, "I also like that the pool is outside."

Zalai, who changed her major from finance to international business, said FIU has a good business school as well.

After making her choice and making strides in the classroom, Zita had an immediate impact on her team by putting her name in the FIU record books.

At the Nike Invite on Nov. 18 in Chapel Hill, N.C., Zalai hit the wall with a time of 55.34 in the 100-meter butterfly, which is best all-time at FIU and in the Sun Belt Conference.

"When we recruited her after her program got dropped at ULM," Lung-Zaharia said. "We knew her caliber, so there's no surprise there."

Not only did the time put her in the FIU and Sun Belt record books, it also gave the Hungary native an NCAA B-cut time, which can give her a chance at competing in the NCAA Championships. Recording a B-cut standard time also made her the first person in the three-year history of FIU's swimming program to do so.

"It was pretty cool, [but] it doesn't really mean anything yet," Zalai said. "You need to make A-cut time to make it for sure, but if there aren't enough A-cut time holders, they take people from the B-cuts.

"So I have a chance", said Zalai, "but the closer I get to A-cuts, the bigger chance I have. So I need to improve it."

Zalai added her name in FIU's record book, yet again, in two other events: at the Brown Invitational in Providence, R.I. She recorded a time of 2:08.98 in the 200-meter individual medley Dec. 2, the first day of the invitational.On the last day of events, Dec. 4, she made herself FIU's number one in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 58.69.

But before she set these records and the B-cut time, Zalai was worried that she had peaked her freshman year. Even though she had also placed first her sophomore year, her time had not improved.

So what brought forth the improvement?

"I think it's my attitude," Zalai said. "I talked to the coaches and they said I had the ability to do it, I had all the tools to do it, but I needed to fix it in my head. Like I really need to focus on [improving] and really need to want it. So I did and it worked. [My attitude before was], 'I really wanted it, but I hoped I can do it.' Now I know I can do a lot better."

And not only did that attitude help Zalai to improve, her teammates have started to notice and follow a similar approach.

"She's always trying to exceed herself [and] she makes us all want to step it up one more notch," said senior Kacie Vivo, who is also a team captain.

This was the reason why coach Lung-Zaharia told Zalai to believe in herself.

"Zita has a tremendous amount of potential," Lung-Zaharia said. "What she does is great for her, but it helps out the team tremendously and brings confidence to the team, too."

Headline: Latvia native adapts to living in Miami
Author: Alden Gonzalez / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
You'd never know it on the basketball court, but the best word to describe the 2005-2006 women's basketball team is diversity. Out of its twelve-player roster, six began their basketball careers in different parts of the world.

For one of those players, the journey begins in the small town of Riga, Latvia. Junior center Lasma Jekabsone - averaging 14 points and nine rebounds per game this season - is the epitome of what this ball club is about. 

A player hailing from a different country that leaves it all behind for her love of the game and does whatever she can to make things work.

Jekabsone was born in a very small town and lived in a house with her parents and sister. She didn't have the childhood you would script for a dominating Division I player. 

In fact, she didn't touch a basketball until she was fourteen.

"I lived in a small town," Jekabsone said.  "We had no way of doing any activity. There wasn't even a gym."

Like many of her classmates, Jekabsone learned the game from her PE teacher.  

"I consider him to be my first coach," she said. "He taught me everything I know. Right away I was pretty good, because I was so much taller than everybody else."

So good that after just one year of playing the game, 15-year-old Lasma Jekabsone was ready for high school and would make basketball a part of it. 

She received a scholarship to play in Capital City, a two hour drive from her home, which could very well have been a different country because of its difference to Riga.

"[Capital City] is the biggest city." Jekabsone said. "We have almost 2.5 million people there so it's almost like Miami."

At a very young age, Jekabsone had to get accustomed to living on her own - a stage that would prepare her for making the trip to Miami.

"It was hard for me to move from my little town and go to Capital City, but it made it easier to come here because I had already separated from my family," she said. "It was really difficult [in Capital City] at first because I had to take care of the bills, clean up after myself, go to practice, go to school … it was tough."

After being named her team's best center for three years, winning the Latvian Youth Championship, winning the European Championship as part of the Latvian National Team and averaging 12 points and 9 rebounds per game, Jekabsone got the call from an interested FIU.  

She knew it was time for a more drastic change.

"I had to come because of basketball and my education," Jekabsone said.  "For me, I don't think I could have improved my game by playing at home. I was already at the highest level."

But the opportunity of a lifetime didn't come without some trouble. Jekabsone found Miami to be very different from Capital City.  

Worst of all, her parents weren't there for moral support. They weren't a mere two hours away, they were across the Atlantic Ocean. She knew she was going to have to get through the roughest stage of her life on her own.

"When I was in Latvia, I knew if I messed up real bad I could just go home," Jekabsone said. "But now that I'm here, I realize there's no way back. Whatever happens I just have to get through it myself."

Perseverance has always been the mark of a true champion and throughout her life, Jekabsone has had the resolve to make it through the toughest times.

She quickly made friends with Faeza Bouderra and junior center Liene Bernsone - whom she competed with in Latvia. She now shares her dorm with senior guard Eva Makela.

"It was weird to room with her because she comes from a different culture and just has a completely different mentality," Jekabsone said. "But you should see our apartment. Everything is all clean and nice … we're very organized."

As she made her home in Miami, and quickly made friends on the team, Jekabsone started growing more comfortable in the U.S., but she still found it hard to adjust to the new style of officiating, which is more strict with foul-calling.

"Back home, post players are more aggressive," she said. "There's just more contact allowed. I still have a hard time with it because it's a habit…so does Gordana [Bedalov]."

Jekabsone saw action in eighteen games during her freshman year and got accustomed to coming off the bench, but her sophomore campaign would take her to the next level as she finally got the nod to start. Jekabsone remembers her first-game jitters and the agitation she still gets today.

"[Assistant coach Inge Nissen] came up to me before the game, held my hands and said 'Lasma, you're starting today.' I was so nervous! Even before the game, while we're clapping, I couldn't even hit my hands together … I still get nervous before the games. I just need to get the first rebound, play good defense or make a shot and I feel confident."

That confidence helped Jekabsone start 24 of the team's 29 games, lead the team in rebounds and blocks and secure the starting spot her junior year.

This season, Jekabsone has proved crucial to the success of her team at a time where they needed a presence in the paint more than ever.

"She has stepped up for us in every aspect," said head coach Cindy Russo. "Surprisingly she's contributed as a scorer as well as a defender."

The future is bright for the standout center from Latvia. She is currently majoring in international business and realizes that the next two seasons will prove critical in dictating her future.

"My boyfriend is saying that I need to make it to the WNBA. He's already sending in all the tapes and everything. But that depends. I need to have a good season … if not the WNBA, I want to go back home to my family and play professional ball at Latvia."

Headline: Point guard discusses thoughts on team's play
Author: Andoni Gonzalez-Rua / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Before the men's basketball team (3-12, 0-3 Sun Belt) left on their road trip to face conference foes North Texas and Denver, The Beacon sat down with second-year man Alan Guyton. 

Guyton was medically red-shirted last season because of a knee injury, but has worked his way back this season and fights for the starting spot with incumbent Jayce Lewis and newcomer Elvis Lora to be the Golden Panther's point guard.

Guyton told us his thoughts on the team's struggles so far this year and what will have to be done if this team plans to fulfill their goal of winning the Sun Belt Conference championship.   

Q: Unlike other members of your team who get much of the attention on and off the court, you are still one of the guys that live in the shadows. Tell the readers a little about yourself. 

I'm a 21-year-old senior in the classroom, junior on the court. This is my second season at FIU but my first season playing. Due to injury, I had to sit out last season. I'm a father of a four month old son who lives in Texas. 

Q: How devastating was it to have to sit out all of last season with the knee injury?

It was really devastating. It was my second time having that injury. I knew what I had to do to get back on the court and it took a lot of hard work, but I am happy to be where I am right now. 

Q: As far as this season goes, it has been a struggle to get things going so far. What is it going to take for this team to get over the hump and finally start to succeed the way everyone close to the program expects?

Just putting together two halves - finishing games. There have been plenty of games where we have had a lead and we end up losing it.

It just comes down to putting all of the small things together, as far as taking care of the ball, rebounding late in games [and] making free throws. 

Q: Following one of the losses over Christmas Break, it seemed that you were disillusioned because of having to split playing time with Jayce Lewis and Elvis Lora at the point. What is it going to take personally to earn the right to lead this team?

[It's going to take] hard work and dedication - something that I have been giving already. Let's not get this wrong, we have an understanding and there's no problem. Everyone wants to play. 

[Head coach Sergio Rouco] has been straightforward with me. He wanted me to get healthy, to get my leg stronger - something that has been happening - and since then I have been seeing more playing time and I just have to keep up the hard work. 

Q: As a team it seems that you rely on certain players every night and as far as the losing streak goes, something that few want to talk about, what is it going to take, as far as consistency goes, to get this team motivated? 

It is going to take a complete team effort. Basketball is a team sport. We rely on some guys more then others, but as long as everyone comes through with their role, then we are pretty much going to get the win. 

It is small things [that] are holding us from going over the hump, but we are going to get there real soon - hopefully on this road trip. 

Q: What can you attribute these mistakes - such as the turnovers and the lead losses - late in games to? 

That is simply not focusing and trying too hard not to lose, instead of playing to win. Playing not to lose. When you play not to lose, that is what happens most of the time. We haven't been taking care of the ball. 

Q: After the last loss, coach Rouco talked about howthe team doesn't know how to close a team out yet. What is it going to take to get past that point? Is it something that has to do with experience or is it something that has to do with the character of the players? 

I don't think it's an experience thing. We have a lot of experience. Everyone on our team has come from a winning program, whether it's high school or junior college or wherever it may be. 

It is all about just putting together a whole 40 minutes. In basketball, if you don't play 40 minutes and you don't play until the end, you can't win. If the team can do that, then we are mostly likely going to win. We just need to put together a whole game instead of playing well in spurts. 

Q: With regards to the fans, it seemed as though the team was drawing larger crowds at the beginning of the season, but as the season has progressed the fan base has dwindled along with the struggles on the court. What do you have to say to those fans that no longer come or never came to games to begin with? 

Just don't lose faith in us. We are not going to lose faith. We are not going to give up and we are going to turn this thing around real soon. 

As far as the fans, its cool. I understand, it's Miami. There are a whole number of things that you can do, but its something that is out of our control. 

Coach always tells us we are going to play the same way whether there are 10,000 in here or if its 10. We are still going to play hard with one thing on our minds: to win. 

I am pretty sure, though, that when we start winning, everyone will start showing up again. That'll be a good thing.

Headline: Iranian leader's intentions uncertain
Author: Charlie Grau / Editor-In-Chief
&nbsp;
World leaders protested Jan. 10 as the Iranian government broke seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency on equipment that could be used to create nuclear energy. 

Though grievances related to this issue have been heard before, the idea that the Middle Eastern nation could one day have atomic resources is nothing new - CIA files show that the country has been trying to kick-start an energy program for the last 20 years. 

However, Iran wanting access to nuclear energy isn't what's making politicians around the globe nervous; it's the fact that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the country's elected president, wants access to nuclear energy.

Despite his flare for violent rhetoric and his shady past, Ahmadinejad has found himself in the center of the world stage (and in the nightmares of Washington suits) because of the many contradictions that surround him, turning him overnight into a great, political puzzle.

The world sees him as the scowling despot-in-training who stood behind a giant banner reading "The World without Zionism" in October and gave a speech calling for the eradication of Israel from the face of the earth.

This is the man that five witnesses say helped in the 1979 capture of an American embassy in Tehran, keeping U.S. citizens hostage for over a year.

This is also the man that, as mayor of Tehran in 2003, helped distribute soup among the city's poor and established a series of charities to aid the underprivileged.

His countrymen see him as the great benefactor who promised to bring oil-money to their tables and passed a bill in support of the Reza Love Fund which will aid young, married people to find affordable houses and good jobs.

Washington sees him as a threat; Tehran sees him as a savior. Which face, then, really belongs to Ahmadinejad? Or more importantly, which is more dangerous?

Like Evo Morales in Bolivia and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Ahmadinejad is joining a list of leaders who may not hold veto powers in any international council but are still not afraid to rage against the perceived American threat. 

However, unlike Chavez and Morales, who are looking for allies in surrounding countries and across the globe, the Iranian president cares only for the well-being of his own borders and is indifferent to potential allies.

Ahmadinejad scares the world, and he scares it badly. Because the man who says nuclear weapons would be a violation of Muslim law is also the man who rallied for a new Jewish genocide, would-be allies in Beijing and Moscow (who would profit from an exchange of Iran's resources) have shown discontent at the two-faced leader. 

They ask why, if Iran had followed IAEA regulations for the last two years, cooperating with the organization and world governments, this new leader has decided to step in and break all ties to peace.

In this act of defiance, Ahmadinejad has shown that he is willing to roar not just at the U.S., but at the entire world, which he sees as trying to intervene in the welfare of his state.

The Iranian leader has the power, the courage and soon, the backing of nuclear energy to make his roar sound louder. But it is the unpredictable nature of this enigmatic leader that makes him a scary and dangerous man.

Subheadline: Maidique's delayed response to spy allegations unsatisfactory
Author: [no author name found]
&nbsp;
One of the responsibilities of being a university president, as with any other position of leadership, is to calm the fears of the community that looks to them for guidance.

Modesto A. Maidique failed the FIU community in this respect when, for three days, he did not speak or release a statement to the university regarding Carlos M. Alvarez and Elsa Alvarez, two university employees arrested by FBI agents Jan. 6 for failing to register as foreign agents with the U.S. Attorney's office.

Even though the media (including The Beacon) requested information from the office of the president regarding the events a few hours after the arrest was made public on Jan 9, no official declaration was released until Jan. 11. 

Although Director of Media Relations Mark Riordan stated that the president was occupied with Faculty Senate negotiations, this could not have occupied enough time to not allow him to respond adequately.

We cannot expect Maidique to immediately divulge all the details of the situation. 

However, some explanation of the impact these events will have on FIU should have been given quicker, whether through a press release or even a University wide e-mail.

Instead of fulfilling these responsibilities, Maidique (who has been friends with Carlos Alvarez for 25 years) decided instead to attend the couple's court hearing, not as their boss, but as a friend in order to assure the court there was no risk of the Alvarezes fleeing back to Cuba.

Although we are sympathetic to Maidique's precarious situation (balancing friendship and his professional reputation), we feel that his first priority should have been to the University, especially one with such a high percentage of Cuban-American enrollment.

Headline: The Immigration "Problem"
Subheadline: Increased security along borders needed to better national defense  
Author: Christopher Necuze / Opinion Editor
&nbsp;
America has always been a land of immigrants. Even the framers of the Constitution, our earliest fathers, trace their heritage to distant lands. 

Countless waves of immigrants during the adolescent stages of our country's development, has made the population of the United States a hodgepodge of peoples with different cultures and ethnicities. While this remains true to this day, border security has become too lax, and a potential security hazard.

"Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free/The wretched refuse of your teeming shore …" reads the plaque on the base of the Statue of Liberty. Times have changed since the early 20th century, when over 22 million people arrived by boat and passed through Ellis Island. Things have gotten a bit more complicated since then.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the largest source country for unauthorized immigration is Mexico. In the 2000 census, it was estimated that 4.8 million illegal aliens from Mexico resided in the U.S. Most of these people cross the border in search of jobs - picking fruit that pay less than minimum wage. 

The problem here is the fact that these men and women are here illegally and have no documentation whatsoever. The fact that these people, while their intentions may be decent, can just waltz across the border with hardly any problem is a tad disturbing to me. What if one day the person walking across that boundary is not Mexican?  

What if they have a bomb strapped to themselves and are headed for one of the many schools located just across that border?

I don't mean to scare anyone, but border security is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed. More manpower needs to be allocated into border security to keep illegal aliens out. Whether it is physical barriers, better technology, improved organization or hopefully all three, something has to be done. 

Some senators have gone as far to suggest building a wall along the U.S./Mexico border to keep illegal immigrants out. I am not saying that we should close our doors to immigrants; I think a wall might be a bit much. 

I am merely suggesting that we should provide the means for them to enter the country legally so that we are able to separate the well intentioned people from the potentially mal-intentioned  people.

The situation has gotten so bad in some parts of the southwest that citizens have set up armed militias to stop Mexicans from entering the U.S. More recently, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano has stationed national guardsmen at the border to deter potential immigrants from crossing the border. 

"We are going to step up and protect our citizens when the federal government fails them - but this is a federal problem, and we expect the federal government to do its part," Napolitano told lawmakers during a news conference.

This is indeed a federal problem and though the administration has the right ideas in mind, nothing has been put into action.  According to the GOP website, one of the things that the administration plans to do is create a temporary worker program so that immigrants can come 'out of the shadows,' as the GOP puts it, and work legally.

Of course everything is a 'top priority' according to the Bush administration. Talk, though, is still talk. Nothing has been done and the problem persists.  

Aside from Mexico, we also share a border with Canada. I don't think that there is such an issue with Canada as there is with Mexico. 

The fact that Canada is a developed country, and their economy essentially quaternary, means that you are not going to have the large amounts of migrant workers from Canada that you have from Mexico. 

Nonetheless, if border security is going to be properly attempted, then it has to include all the borders, not just the one with Mexico. 	

Though Mexico is where the great majority of illegal immigrants come from, it should not be pinpointed as the sole source.

My problem is not with the migrant workers - they do jobs everyday Americans are not willing to do and that are necessary - the dilemma, I feel, lies in the lack of policy that lets honest immigrants work and also maintains control of the inflow.

To close America's doors to people of different nationalities seeking better opportunities is downright un-American.

Headline: Failure to register as foreign agents led to arrests
Subheadline: Maidique asks for patience, Alvarezes limited on defense
Author: Ana Sanchez
&nbsp;
Professor Carlos M. Alvarez and his wife Elsa Alvarez have limited options when it comes to their defense, according to a professor in FIU's College of Law.

Professor Aya Gruber - who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard law school, worked as a defense counsel and teaches criminal law at FIU's College of law - suggests that the Alvarezes would have to argue that they are not foreign agents. 

FBI agents arrested Carlos Alvarez, associate professor for the educational leadership and policy studies, and wife Elsa Alvarez, counselor for the psychological services department on Jan. 6. 

The couple was indicted  Jan. 9 for being covert agents for the government of Cuba.

Since the couple is charged with failing to register as foreign agents with the U.S. Attorney's office, ignorance of the law is not a strong enough defense.

"It's very easy to become a foreign agent if you are communicating with a foreign government," Gruber said. "If they know that they are acting as foreign agents but they just didn't know that they had to register, it likely won't be a defense; however, if they argue that they aren't foreign agents, that would be a defense."

On June 22, 2005, Carlos Alvarez admitted to the FBI that he transmitted information about Miami's exile community to the Cuban government using various methods, which included shortwave radio, a five-digit code and encrypted disks. 

Elsa Alvarez admitted to similar actions July 5, 2005. 

However, the activities the Alvarezes admitted to were not enough evidence to charge them with espionage.

According to The Miami Herald, Congress knew about the activities Elsa Alvarez was involved in for the Cuban government as early as 1982. 

Furthermore, The Miami Herald also revealed that Elsa Alvarez was once a member of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a leftist organization which describes themselves as sympathizers of revolutionary ideals. 

The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 defines a foreign agent as someone who acts at the order, request or under the direction of a foreign principal; who either engages in political activities in a public relations capacity for a foreign principal; or solicits  any thing of value within the United States or someone who represents the interests of a foreign principal before any agency  of the U.S. government. 

A possible defense for the Alvarezes would be to argue that even though they communicated with officials of the Cuban government, they didn't follow the officials' directions or agree to follow any of their directions, or claim to not know that made them a foreign agent.

"Whether or not they will be able to prove that [they aren't foreign agents] really depends on the evidence. The more they used code names or shortwave radio, the more they did clandestine meetings, the more likely it is that they know they are acting in the capacity of an agent," Gruber said. 

For his part, University President Modesto A. Maidique addressed the public Jan. 10 via a press release sent through university e-mail, three days after the media reported the Alvarez couple's arrest. 

According to the press release, the university did not violate federal procedures related to the funding of travel to Cuba: state money was not used for such travel, no FIU students accompanied Professor Alvarez on the trips to Cuba under any FIU program and no FIU students were recruited by Alvarez to participate in  any illegal activities. 

In addition, the press release confirmed that the university has retained Former U.S. Attorney Roberto Martinez of the Colson Hicks Eidson Law Firm to investigate and advise the university on this matter and cooperating with federal government officials. 

Maidique asked for patience from the university community. 

"The public can be assured that FIU will continue to fully cooperate with authorities and will take appropriate actions at the university level," Maidique said in the press release. 

Director of Media Relations Mark Riordan confirmed that on Jan. 9 Maidique went to the Alvarezes court appearance not as the university president, but as a friend of the Alvarezes specifically to address the issue about "whether they present a flight risk and say that he did not believe that they were." 

Maidique reassured the community that he had no idea the Alvarez couple participated in the activities stated in the indictment.

"My personal and professional interactions with the Alvarezes gave me absolutely no indication of any of the activities outlined in the indictment," Maidique said in the press release.

The Alvarezes are being held without bond in the Miami Federal Detention Center and an arraignment will be held Jan. 19.   

Maidique and University Provost Ronald Berkman would not comment on the matter to The Beacon, despite several requests.

Headline: Wish Givers fund raise to help sick children smile
Author: Shannon Hernandez / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
The Biscayne Bay Campus has a special group of Wish Givers, students who work together to put a smile on a sick child's face. 

Wish Givers, an organization designed to help children, meet in the Campus Life office daily. Their purpose is to fulfill wishes by working to raise funds for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, a non-profit organization that grants wishes to children with life-threatening diseases. 

The MAW foundation helps children ages two and a half to 18 with life threatening illnesses and disabilities, such as Muscular Dystrophy or cancer, and has even helped current FIU student Zach Trautenberg, who uses a wheelchair to get around campus.

On July 6, 2001 Trautenberg had his wish granted when he became the youngest person to ring the New York Stock Exchange closing bell. Since then he has wanted to help support the Make-a-Wish Foundation (MAW). 

"I would like to see more kids have wishes granted like I had. Two things to know about MAW is income doesn't matter and you don't have to be terminally ill," Trauntenberg said, president of Wish Givers.

Group members have strong team-working skills, according to Trauntenberg.

"This group is truly the greatest. They work together extremely well and have so much enthusiasm for the club," Trauntenberg said. "The Wish Givers club is a community service based group with great importance and great purpose." 

According to the Wish Givers Club website, the group raises funds through functions that will not only support the community, the Wish givers hold functions that will entertain the community - such as dunking machines. It is an astounding organization that really focuses on helping children.

"BBC Wish Givers's goal is to grant two wishes per year at a price of $5,000 per wish. To achieve this goal we have been doing many things. We are presently selling discount cards for Java City at BBC. These are $5 and save people money on every purchase. On Dec. 5 we had a dunk tank outside Panther Square," said Trautenberg. 

However, according to Vanessa Robinson, vice-president of the club, support from BBC students is not as high as the group would like it to be. 

 "We raised a little over $200; we would have liked more people and we are going to try it again in the Spring [semester]," she said. 

The group is planning a Jazz Era Casino Benefit Night on Feb. 7 in the Wolfe University Center ballroom; doors open at 6:30 p.m. 

"This event will include free music, movie, dinner, dessert and more." Trauntenberg said. "The Wish Givers will hold a silent auction with a variety of items and casino games to play."

All the money raised from this event will be donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The Wish Givers donate the revenue to MAW of South Florida and will select the child. 

"Right now we are still in the planning stage. We started in the middle of the Fall semester," Robinson said. 

As a Wish Giver, students can be part of the group and coordinate fundraisers to help sponsor wishes for children throughout the community.

"We are in need of people to support our events. Students can sign up to come help out in events as they choose. For example, we are in need of card dealers for the casino night," Trautenberg said.

Headline: MLK forum guest speaker gets standing ovation 
Author: Ana Ribeiro / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
Hyped up middle and highschool students did hip-hop moves in front of FIU officials as the voice of WEDR 99-Jamz's DJ Irie - an FIU alumnus - filled the Wolfe University Center Ballroom, mixed with laughter and cheers from the audience.

But the audience fell silent and turned around when a singing voice emerged from the back of the room, asking people to let their lives "shine." 

The melodious words came from Tonea Stewart, who has a PhD in theater a rich history as an actress and an African-American woman growing up during the Civil Rights movement. From the moment Stewart walked onto the stage to the moment she stepped off, all eyes and ears in the WUC Ballroom seemed to remain fixed on her.   

Stewart was the guest speaker at the Biscayne Bay Campus' Sixth Annual Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Youth Forum, which took place Jan. 10 as part of the FIU-wide MLK celebration. 

Janice Spann-Givens, an organizers for the MLK events, said the forum brought together at least 200 students from eight South Florida schools.

"This is our opportunity to do community outreach," Spann-Givens said, who is also assistant director of Multicultural Programs and Services at FIU. "And it's a roundabout way to bring students who normally wouldn't have a chance to come here." 

While largely devoid of FIU students, the WUC Ballroom was packed with  other students and dozens of faculty members from FIU and the visiting schools. 

One of the visiting faculty members was Joseph Evans, head of social studies at Coral Reef Senior High and a fan of Stewart. 

"Hearing her speak at Alabama State University inspired me to become a teacher," Evans said, a graduate from ASU, where Stewart teaches and runs the theater arts department. "She speaks from the heart. She makes you feel every aspect of her stories."

Stewart told the audience personal anecdotes while incorporating her knowledge of history and culture - and playing out the characters she mentioned as she went along. Throughout her speech, she emphasized the theme that everyone has a calling in life and should strive for excellence in whatever he or she does.

"Somebody in this room will come up with a cure for AIDS," Stewart said. "Somebody in this room will be a political leader of tomorrow ... where you come from does not dictate where you'll end up."

Stewart went on to talk about how difficult things were for African Americans when she was a young girl in Mississippi. Among other aspects, she said she'd go to a shoe store and not be allowed to try on shoes because of her skin color; she wasn't allowed to ride the school bus either, while white kids would throw rotten eggs at her from the bus windows; and once, she took lunch to her father at his construction job and felt "so dirty" when his bosses didn't allow him to take a sip of water from the very fountain he had built. 

"But it wasn't long before the Civil Rights workers came," she said. "They came by the bus loads."

 Stewart said she heard King Jr. speak at civil rights meetings, but the man whose teachings touched her most deeply was called Papa Dallas - and she passed them along to the audience. 

Papa Dallas, an old blind African-American, would see into the future and tell the people in her community what they'd become in life, Stewart said. 

With tears in her eyes, Stewart played the part of herself as a little girl and of Papa Dallas as she continued telling his story. 

At one point, Papa Dallas revealed he had his eyes burned out by his masters when he was a slave boy simply trying to learn the alphabet so he could read the Bible. 

"[The story of Papa Dallas] represents the sacrifices people have made in the past and [Stewart's] commitment to him to continue to tell the story," Rosa Jones, vice president of Student Affairs and Undergraduate Education, said after wiping her tears and getting up in unison with the rest of the audience to applaud Stewart.

After the speech, two students from Coral Reef Senior High got up to ask Stewart questions. Clarissa Parks, 18, and Woodrow Littlejohn, 17, asked Stewart to give advice and talk a bit more about her experiences. 

"She gave me more confidence to talk to others about making their dreams come true," Parks said, a student leadership counselor at her school. 

Littlejohn could relate to Stewart both on a personal level - he said her words reminded him of things his mother would say - and on a professional level, as he's an aspiring actor and singer.   

"I felt it was good material for us to keep going," Littlejohn said "We could be in the same place one day, or even speaking to millions of people.

Headline: University prepares for democratic primaries
Author: Luisa Cabrera / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
On Jan. 17, FIU will house the Democratic Primary Gubernatorial Debate.  

Candidates for the 2006 election for governor, Congressman Jim Davis and State Senator Rod Smith will debate in the University Park Graham Center Ballroom on at 7 p.m. to answer panel and audience questions and meet students and community members who attend the debate.

The debate will be the first event of the campaign process that has not involved raising finances.  

The candidates will discuss issues they have chosen for the debate such as health care, immigration and the environment.  

Panelists were chosen based on their expertise in their field, such as the director of Women's Studies at FIU, Suzanna Rose and the president of Citizens for a Better South Florida, Arsenio Milian.

Leonard P. Strickman, dean of FIU's Law School, will moderate the debate and panel. 

Persons who attend will have the chance to meet the candidates after the questionnaire segment, and may also meet many prominent representatives of several South Florida democratic organizations.

FIU was chosen for the event in order to help involve Florida's youth in the governor's election.

"FIU was chosen to involve young people in the political process, where they can hear the candidates discuss issues and make their own judgments about candidates rather than believe what they hear on television," said Jack Parker, professor of environmental science and advisor to the College Democrats.

Many student-oriented projects will be occurring throughout Florida for the governor's race in 2006.  

Campaign managers and candidates are trying to involve students in the elections process, hoping to address issues which concern them.

In a press release by candidate Davis, he stated, "When it comes to improving our schools, it is time for parents and students to be heard."

Candidate Smith said in his press release: "It is so crucial to our children and our communities that we provide quality public schools."

"Education will obviously be a topic of discussion considering the location of the debate; students need to know that who they elect affects everything - their tuition rates, the tests they take and the conditions of their schools," Parker said.

FIU is not the only school focusing on the Gubernatorial elections process.  Florida A&M and University of South Florida will also house events and rallies for the candidates.  

The issue of student involvement in the elections process has been a hot topic since the presidential election of 2004.  

The focus on governmental clubs and extracurricular activities has begun to climb.

"It's hard to get political clubs going; now that there is a major election, we're hoping people will start paying attention to what is going on in their state," said Mark Romero, member of the College Democrats. 

A running candidate for the election will not be chosen until after September, when the two democratic candidates will face-off in another debate.

"The polls are indicating a close race," Parker said.

Candidate Davis has served 17 years in the State Congress and Legislature, fighting for issues involving education, senior citizens and the environment.  

He was elected majority leader of the Florida House of Representatives in the 1990. 

Candidate Smith was a practicing attorney for 17 years and was elected State Attorney in 1996. 

He served in the Florida Senate beginning in 2002, addressing issues of crime, abused children and discrimination.

Headline: Proper rotation lengthens car life   
Author: Agustin Gracia / Contributing Writer
&nbsp;
Nothing hurts more than firing up a car only to find the dash lit up like a Christmas tree. Check engine, low coolant, oil pressure, you know, the usual culprits. Well, it's not too difficult to make those pesky bulbs shut off for good with a little care and maintenance at regular intervals. 

The following will cover something anyone can do easily, and most importantly free of charge (assuming you have at least some basic tools): tire rotation.

Your only connection to the road comes from four chunks of rubber firmly attached, hopefully, to your wheels. So it is imperative that they are in good condition and properly cared for.


Tools Needed: Tire Iron, Floor Jack, 4 Jack Stands, Torque Wrench (rated for 80ft/lbs or more)

Tire rotation ensures your tires are evenly worn and will prolong the life of your tires and prevent the occurrence of bald spots or sections on the tire. It should be done every two oil changes or approximately every 6,000 miles. 

Some vehicles have different  wheel sizes in the front and rear (usually rear wheel drive sports cars) so your rotation pattern may be limited. Refer to your owner's manual for the recommended rotation interval and tips on tire rotation.


Step 1: Ensure that your vehicle is parked on a level surface, with the handbrake engaged (Or footbrake if you drive an older domestic vehicle).

Step 2: Use your tire iron to loosen the lug nuts on the front driver's side wheel. A tire iron should come with your vehicle, but I prefer to use a cross tire iron (named for it's "+" shape) since it loosens the bolts easier and gives you more leverage. Do not remove the lug nuts, keep them on the wheel but loose enough that you will be able to remove them with your fingers.

Step 3: Raise the front driver's side using a floor jack. 

Consult your owner's manual under the spare tire installation section and it will show you where the jack should be placed. In general, there is a metal rail running along the bottom of the car, about one or two inches from the side skirts. On this rail you will see a set of notches near each wheel. This is the jack point used by the butterfly jack to raise the car in the event of needing to use your spare. You can use this to raise your car with the floor jack. Once the car is raised, lower it on jack stands to keep it suspended in the air. 

Step 4: Remove the lug nuts and pull off the wheel.

Step 5: Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 with the driver's side rear wheel, then the passenger side front wheel and finally the passenger rear wheel.

Step 6: Your car should be lifted in the air now without wheels. Now for the "rotation" part. The front driver's side wheel will be moved to the passenger side rear. The front passenger side wheel should be moved to the rear driver's side. Finally, bring the wheels which were originally in the rear to the front. 

Step 7: Tighten down the lug nuts by hand until they are snug. Next, tighten them with your tire iron. Finally, you will need a torque wrench. An inexpensive beam type torque wrench will be fine for securing your wheels, but you should consider buying a nice one later on, as you will be using it for many key components on your vehicle. Snap On, Matco and MAC  are the cream of the crop when it comes to tools. With your torque wrench, tighten each lug nut to the factory recommended pressure. For example, my Nissan owner's manual recommends 80ft/lbs. 

Congratulations, you're ready to roll!

Headline: Movie Mania
Subheadline: Remakes, prequels, 40-year-old virgins mark 2005's best
Author: Reuben Pereira / Staff Writer
&nbsp;
The year 2005 offered more overbudgeted sequels, remakes and the infamous box office slump. 

Continuations of old favorites such as Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire were the highest grossing films.  

There were plenty of fine films released, making it a truly interesting year at the movies. These were the best:


10: 40 Year-Old Virgin

2005 marked the return of the 'R- rated comedy' with both Wedding Crashers and The 40-Year-Old Virgin becoming sleeper hits. 

People expecting a raunchy comedy came out enjoying not only that, but also a sweet and touching romance. With this film, Steve Carell not only proved that he can carry a film but also that he is one of America's funniest actors. This is the best comedy of 2005.


9: Jarhead

Sam Mendes's adaptation of Anthony Swofford's best selling memoirs of his Gulf War experiences is a particularly unique war film with hardly any action and mostly waiting for 'the mother of all battles,' as Saddam Hussein put it; waiting for a war that never came. Jarhead is a bitter portrait of the nightmares of war and the psychological impact on the men who fight it. 


8: Batman Begins

Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins marked the renaissance of the Batman franchise that was all but left for dead after 1997's atrocious Batman and Robin. A dark and cerebral film, Batman Begins deals with the origins of the Dark Knight while also remaining a great action picture. Christian Bale is arguably the best actor who's played  Batman and he's well supported by a magnificent cast including Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.


7:Crash

Paul Haggis's Crash runs through the lives of 12 different individuals over 48 hours as racial boundaries 'crash' into each other. Crash reminds us that racism and prejudice flow through people of all races. In today's world, there isn't any particular race that plays victim or oppressor. Matt Dillon as a racist officer and Terrace Howard as a conflicted TV director stand out among a talented cast including Oscar nominee Don Cheadle, superstar Sandra Bullock and rapper Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. There are very few films which make us think about others - this is one of them.


6:Capote

Philip Seymour Hoffman will most likely win the Oscar for his incredible performance as Truman Capote, author of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "In Cold Blood," the writing of which the film chronicles. Hoffman nails the mannerisms and character of the flamboyant Capote as he interviews people in the town of Holcomb, Kansas - most notably Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, the two men guilty of massacring four members of the Clutter family in 1959.


5:A History of Violence

David Cronenberg's film may seem like a simplistic thriller at first but once you dig through the layers, it's a study of the destruction of the 'American Dream.' The life of a seemingly perfect small-town family is shattered when a simple act of heroism brings them the wrong type of attention. The film contains sequences of brutal and graphic violence that is at once, shocking and surprising. It's a haunting film that lingers in your memory long after you're done watching it.


4:Good Night and Good Luck

George Clooney's sophomore directional effort is an ambitious and powerful statement set amid the televised wars between Senator Joseph McCarthy and journalist Edward R. Murrow (played by the mesmerizing David Strathairn). Shot in stark black and white, Clooney masterly displays the sense of fear that Americans lived in during an era where careers and lives were lost due to McCarthy's Communist witch hunts.


3:King Kong

Peter Jackson's King Kong is a masterpiece of technical wizardry and epic scope. Although clocking up to three hours, Kong is nothing short of breathtaking from start to finish. As far as big budget blockbusters go, this is the year's best. The two major Skull Island action sequences are worth the price of admission alone.


2:Munich

Munich is Steven Spielberg's best work since Saving Private Ryan. The most controversial film of 2005, Spielberg's film about Israel's response to the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics has received criticisms from the Israeli governments for its non-flattering portrayal. Very poignant in today's political climate, the film asks us, among other things, whether vengeance is justified and how a government should react when faced with a terrorist attack. Munich plays as a tense 1970s espionage thriller and is masterly shot, edited and directed. As a statement, it is something deeper.


1:Brokeback Mountain

Based on E. Annie Proulx's short story, Ang Lee's film about the romance between two sheep herders, is both heart wrenching and sad. Over simplified and cruelly dubbed 'the gay cowboy movie' by members of the press, Brokeback Mountain is a slow moving but beautiful film about the suppression of love. Heath Ledger's incredible performance stands out in a film that has swept almost every major critics award. Nominated for seven Golden Globes, it enters the Oscar race as the clear cut frontrunner. A groundbreaking picture, Brokeback Mountain is the best film of 2005.
